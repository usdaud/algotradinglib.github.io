Welcome to the repository for [AlgoTradingLib.com](https://algotradinglib.com) - an open encyclopedia for algorithmic trading.

## About the Project

AlgoTradingLib.com is a web resource dedicated to algorithmic trading. Currently, we are focused solely on algorithmic trading, but since algorithmic trading is inseparable from trading in general, we will also expand our definitions to include general trading.

### Reasons for Creating the Project

There are many sources of information: Wikipedia and commercial resources. Wikipedia is not oriented towards niche topics such as algorithmic trading and only covers significant things, not considering algorithmic trading significant, which is why there are very few articles. Commercial resources cover information for money, which is not always objective. For example, popular open-source projects among algorithmic trading might never appear on these resources, which is absurd because they are the most interesting for algorithmic trading.

### How to Help and Contribute

Helping is essential! Without your help, the project cannot grow. For now, we cannot open other languages, but please let us know if you are interested in translations into other languages. The most active way to help is to write and edit articles yourself. You can also point out inaccuracies or highlight missing topics through issues.
