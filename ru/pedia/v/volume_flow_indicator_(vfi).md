# Volume Flow Indicator (VFI)

The volume flow indicator is a technical indicator that estimates the direction of money flow using price and volume data. It aims to identify accumulation and distribution.

## Concept
- Combines price change, volatility filters, and volume to estimate flow.
- Positive values suggest accumulation.
- Negative values suggest distribution.

## Example
A stock rises with strong volume and the VFI turns positive, indicating buying pressure. A divergence between price and VFI can signal weakening momentum.

## Practical notes
VFI calculations vary across platforms. Understanding the specific formula used is important for consistent interpretation.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Volume Flow Indicator (VFI) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Volume Flow Indicator (VFI) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Volume Flow Indicator (VFI), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Volume Flow Indicator (VFI). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Volume Flow Indicator (VFI) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
