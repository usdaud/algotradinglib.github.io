# Moldova Stock Exchange (MSE)

The Moldova Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (MSE) is a prominent financial institution in the Republic of Moldova, which serves as a platform for the trading of securities, including equities, bonds, and other financial instruments. The MSE plays a crucial role in the country's [economy](../e/economy.md) by providing a structured [market](../m/market.md) for companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md), investors to buy and sell securities, and ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and fairness in financial transactions.

## History and Background

The Moldova Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was established in 1995, following the country's transition from a centrally-planned [economy](../e/economy.md) to a [market](../m/market.md)-based [economy](../e/economy.md). The creation of the MSE was part of broader economic reforms aimed at developing [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), attracting [foreign investment](../f/foreign_investment.md), and promoting [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) commenced operations with the support of international financial organizations, which provided technical assistance and [guidance](../g/guidance.md).

## Structure and Governance

The MSE operates under a well-defined legal framework that ensures its smooth functioning and adherence to international [best practices](../b/best_practices.md). The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) is regulated by the National [Commission](../c/commission.md) for [Financial Markets](../f/financial_market.md) (NCFM), the primary regulatory body overseeing the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) in Moldova. The MSE's governance structure includes a Board of Directors, a Supervisory Board, and various committees responsible for different aspects of operations, such as listing, trading, and compliance.

## Market Segments

The MSE offers various [market](../m/market.md) segments where different types of securities are traded. These include:

The [equity market](../e/equity_market.md) is an essential component of the MSE, providing companies with the opportunity to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public.

### Bond Market

The [bond](../b/bond.md) [market segment](../m/market_segment.md) deals with the issuance and trading of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities, such as government and corporate bonds. The [bond market](../b/bond_market.md) provides investors with relatively stable returns and allows issuers to raise long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) at predictable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Derivatives Market

Although not as developed as the [equity](../e/equity.md) and [bond](../b/bond.md) markets, the MSE has been working towards establishing a [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md) where financial instruments like [options](../o/options.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md) can be traded. The [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md) offers advanced [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools for investors and companies.

## Trading Mechanism

The MSE employs an electronic trading system that enables real-time matching of buy and sell orders. This system ensures efficient and transparent [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) and [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades. The trading hours are typically from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM, and trades are settled through a centralized [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) system, which guarantees the finality of transactions.

## Listing Requirements
