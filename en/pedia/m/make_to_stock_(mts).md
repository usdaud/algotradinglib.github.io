# Make to Stock (MTS)

Make to Stock (MTS) is a traditional [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) strategy where production activities are driven primarily by forecasted consumer [demand](../d/demand.md) rather than actual, immediate orders from customers. This approach involves producing goods in anticipation that they [will](../w/will.md) be sold, facilitating faster fulfillment of [customer](../c/customer.md) orders and optimal [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md). MTS is widely used in industries where lead times are critical, [demand](../d/demand.md) is relatively predictable, and [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md) can significantly reduce [production costs](../p/production_costs.md).

## Principles of Make to Stock (MTS)

Make to Stock operates on several foundational principles:

### Demand Forecasting
One of the crucial elements of MTS is accurate [demand forecasting](../d/demand_forecasting.md), which predicts future [customer](../c/customer.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) based on historical data, [market](../m/market.md) trends, [seasonality](../s/seasonality.md), and other factors. Various statistical models and [machine learning algorithms](../m/machine_learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) can enhance the accuracy of forecasts.

### Inventory Management
[Inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) is critical in an MTS system. Companies maintain a predefined level of finished goods [inventory](../i/inventory.md) to quickly meet [customer](../c/customer.md) [demand](../d/demand.md). [Inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) techniques such as Economic [Order](../o/order.md) Quantity (EOQ) and Just-In-Time (JIT) help in maintaining optimal [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels and minimizing [holding costs](../h/holding_costs.md).

### Production Planning
Production planning in MTS involves scheduling [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) activities to ensure that there are sufficient products available to meet forecasted [demand](../d/demand.md) without causing excess [inventory](../i/inventory.md). This includes determining [order](../o/order.md) quantities, production schedules, and the allocation of resources.

### Lead Time
Since products are manufactured ahead of [customer](../c/customer.md) orders, [lead time](../l/lead_time.md), or the time from [order](../o/order.md) placement to delivery, is significantly reduced. This is particularly beneficial for industries where quick delivery is a critical component of [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md).

### Economies of Scale
By producing in larger quantities, companies can take advantage of [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md), reducing the per-[unit cost](../u/unit_cost.md) of production. This is possible due to the spread of fixed costs over a larger number of units and the potential for bulk purchasing of [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md).

## Benefits of Make to Stock (MTS)

Implementing an MTS strategy offers several key benefits:

### Faster Fulfillment
Because products are readily available in [inventory](../i/inventory.md), orders can be fulfilled more rapidly compared to make-to-[order](../o/order.md) (MTO) systems where production starts after an [order](../o/order.md) is received.

### Better Capacity Utilization
MTS allows for more consistent utilization of [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) capacity, as production can be scheduled to keep machinery and labor in use even when [customer](../c/customer.md) orders are not steady.

### Reduced Lead Times
Since products are stocked in anticipation of [customer](../c/customer.md) orders, lead times are significantly reduced, enhancing [customer](../c/customer.md) satisfaction and competitive positioning.

### Cost Efficiency
[Economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md) lower the cost per unit, making the MTS approach financially beneficial, especially for high-[volume](../v/volume.md) products with predictable [demand](../d/demand.md).

### Enhanced Customer Satisfaction
With products readily available for immediate shipment, [customer](../c/customer.md) satisfaction is often higher, leading to increased loyalty and repeat [business](../b/business.md).

## Challenges of Make to Stock (MTS)

Despite its advantages, MTS also presents several challenges:

### Forecasting Accuracy
Accurate [demand forecasting](../d/demand_forecasting.md) is essential but can be difficult to achieve. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to either excess [inventory](../i/inventory.md) or stockouts, both of which are costly.

### Inventory Holding Costs
Maintaining [inventory](../i/inventory.md) comes with [holding costs](../h/holding_costs.md), including storage, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and potential obsolescence, which can impact profitability.

### Market Changes
Sudden changes in [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) can render stocked products obsolete or result in stockouts if [demand](../d/demand.md) surpasses forecasted levels. This [risk](../r/risk.md) requires continuous monitoring and adjustment of forecasts and [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels.

### Production Flexibility
An MTS system can sometimes lack the flexibility to quickly adapt to significant changes in consumer preferences or unexpected [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) shifts, as production is based on forecasts rather than actual orders.

## Applications of Make to Stock (MTS)

### Consumer Goods
Many [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md), such as packaged food products, personal care items, and household goods, are produced using an MTS approach. The predictability of [demand](../d/demand.md) and the necessity for fast fulfillment make MTS an ideal strategy.

### Electronics
Fast-moving electronics like smartphones, tablets, and accessories often use MTS to ensure product availability and rapid fulfillment, reducing the time customers have to wait for newly released products.

### Automotive
In the automotive [industry](../i/industry.md), standardized parts and components are often produced using MTS strategies to ensure quick availability for assembly lines and parts distributors.

## Enhancing MTS with Technology

### Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems
ERP systems integrate various [business](../b/business.md) processes and provide real-time data, enhancing planning, [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md), and [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) accuracy.

### Advanced Analytics
[Data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models improve [forecast accuracy](../f/forecast_accuracy.md) by analyzing large datasets to identify trends and patterns that might not be apparent through traditional methods.

### Automation
Automation in [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) processes enhances [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and consistency, allowing for better [inventory](../i/inventory.md) control and reducing the time needed to switch between production runs.

## Case Studies of MTS Implementation

### Samsung Electronics
Samsung employs an MTS strategy for its smartphones and other high-[demand](../d/demand.md) electronics. By maintaining stock levels of popular models, Samsung can rapidly meet [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md), especially during new product launches.

### Procter & Gamble (P&G)
Procter & Gamble uses MTS for many of its consumer products. With sophisticated [demand forecasting](../d/demand_forecasting.md) and efficient [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management, P&G ensures that its products are available to consumers with minimal lead times.

## Conclusion

Make to Stock (MTS) is a strategic approach in [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) and [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management that prioritizes production based on forecasted [demand](../d/demand.md). While it offers benefits such as faster fulfillment and cost efficiencies, it also requires precise [demand forecasting](../d/demand_forecasting.md) and [robust](../r/robust.md) [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) practices to mitigate risks associated with excess [inventory](../i/inventory.md) and inadequate [supply](../s/supply.md). With technological advancements in analytics and automation, MTS continues to evolve, providing companies with tools to better predict [demand](../d/demand.md) and manage production more effectively.
