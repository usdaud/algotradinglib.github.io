# Margin Call

[Margin](../m/margin.md) call is a term commonly used in the financial [industry](../i/industry.md), particularly in trading and [investing](../i/investing.md). It occurs when the [value](../v/value.md) of an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [margin account](../m/margin_account.md) falls below the [broker](../b/broker.md)'s required amount, signaling that more funds are needed to cover potential losses. This document provides a detailed exploration of [margin](../m/margin.md) calls, their mechanics, importance, and strategies to manage them.

## Understanding Margin

### What is Margin?
[Margin](../m/margin.md) refers to the amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) borrowed from a [broker](../b/broker.md) to purchase securities. It allows investors to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) their positions, essentially amplifying potential gains and losses.

### How Margin Works
When trading on [margin](../m/margin.md), an [investor](../i/investor.md) might put down a percentage of the total [trade](../t/trade.md) [value](../v/value.md), while borrowing the rest. For instance, if the [margin](../m/margin.md) requirement is 50%, an [investor](../i/investor.md) might put down $10,000 of their own [money](../m/money.md) to buy $20,000 worth of stock, borrowing the remaining $10,000 from their [broker](../b/broker.md).

## Margin Call Mechanics

### Maintenance Margin
A key aspect of [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) is the [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md), which is the minimum amount of [equity](../e/equity.md) that must be maintained in a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md). Brokers set this level to ensure that the account retains sufficient [value](../v/value.md) to cover potential losses.

### Triggering a Margin Call
A [margin](../m/margin.md) call is triggered when the account's [equity](../e/equity.md) falls below the [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md). For example, if an account requires 30% [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) and the account [value](../v/value.md) drops such that the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [equity](../e/equity.md) becomes less than 30% of the current [value](../v/value.md) of the positions, a [margin](../m/margin.md) call occurs.

### Margin Call Example
- [Investor](../i/investor.md) borrows $10,000 to buy $20,000 worth of stock.
- The [broker](../b/broker.md)'s [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) is 30%.
- If the [value](../v/value.md) of the stock falls to $14,000, the [equity](../e/equity.md) in the account is now $4,000 ($14,000 - $10,000).
- The required [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) is 30% of $14,000, which equals $4,200.
- Since $4,000 < $4,200, a [margin](../m/margin.md) call is triggered.

## Consequences of a Margin Call

### Meeting the Margin Call
Upon receiving a [margin](../m/margin.md) call, the [investor](../i/investor.md) must restore the [account balance](../a/account_balance.md) to the [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) level. This can be done by:
1. Adding additional cash to the account.
2. Selling assets in the account to reduce the [margin](../m/margin.md) [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Forced Liquidation
If the [investor](../i/investor.md) fails to meet the [margin](../m/margin.md) call, the [broker](../b/broker.md) has the right to [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) some or all of the account’s [holdings](../h/holdings.md) to bring the account back to the required [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) level.

## Importance of Margin Calls

### Risk Management
[Margin](../m/margin.md) calls serve as a [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tool to protect both the [broker](../b/broker.md) and the [investor](../i/investor.md) from excessive losses. By requiring additional funds or the [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) of assets, brokers mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of an account going into a negative balance.

### Investor Discipline
[Margin](../m/margin.md) calls enforce [investor](../i/investor.md) discipline by ensuring that positions are not excessively leveraged. They prompt investors to continuously monitor their account balances and the [market](../m/market.md) performance of their securities.

## Managing Margin Calls

### Regular Monitoring
Investors should regularly monitor their [margin account](../m/margin_account.md) and the performance of their securities. Using financial tools and alerts can help in staying updated.

### Margin Cushion
Maintaining a [margin](../m/margin.md) cushion—keeping more [equity](../e/equity.md) than the minimum required—can help in avoiding [margin](../m/margin.md) calls, especially during [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Diversification
Diversifying assets can spread [risk](../r/risk.md) across different investments, reducing the likelihood that a significant drop in one [security](../s/security.md) [will](../w/will.md) trigger a [margin](../m/margin.md) call.

### Hedging Strategies
Employing [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md), such as [options](../o/options.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md), can help in mitigating potential losses and managing [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements effectively.

## Real-life Examples

### Case of the 2008 Financial Crisis
During the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), many investors faced [margin](../m/margin.md) calls as the [market](../m/market.md) plummeted. The dramatic drop in [asset](../a/asset.md) values triggered widespread [margin](../m/margin.md) calls, leading to forced liquidations and further driving down [market](../m/market.md) prices.

### Archegos Capital Management
Archegos, a family office managed by Bill Hwang, made headlines in 2021 due to massive [margin](../m/margin.md) calls. The [firm](../f/firm.md) had highly leveraged positions in various [stocks](../s/stock.md). When those [stocks](../s/stock.md)' prices fell, [margin](../m/margin.md) calls from brokers like [Credit](../c/credit.md) Suisse and Nomura led to the [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) of billions in assets.

## Conclusion

[Margin](../m/margin.md) calls are a critical aspect of [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md), serving both as a [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) mechanism and a prompt for [investor](../i/investor.md) discipline. Understanding the mechanics and managing [margin](../m/margin.md) accounts effectively are essential for investors who engage in leveraged trading. Through regular monitoring, maintaining a [margin](../m/margin.md) cushion, diversifying investments, and employing [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md), investors can navigate the complexities of [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) and mitigate the risks associated with [margin](../m/margin.md) calls.
