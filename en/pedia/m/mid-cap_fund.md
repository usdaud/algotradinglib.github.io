# Mid-Cap Fund

A [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) is a type of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) or [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded [fund](../f/fund.md) (ETF) that invests primarily in [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) companies. These companies generally have [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations ranging from $2 billion to $10 billion, although the exact definition can vary slightly depending on the source.

## Key Characteristics

### Market Capitalization
[Market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), often referred to as [market](../m/market.md) cap, is calculated by multiplying the total number of a company's outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) by the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of one share. [Mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) companies represent a middle ground between large-cap companies, which have [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations exceeding $10 billion, and small-cap companies, which have [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations below $2 billion.

### Growth Potential
[Mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) companies often exhibit higher growth potential compared to large-cap companies. They are typically in the growth phase of their [business cycle](../b/business_cycle.md), expanding operations and entering new markets. As a result, they [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for higher returns but also come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to their more established large-cap counterparts.

### Volatility
While [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) funds [offer](../o/offer.md) significant growth potential, they also come with higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Economic downturns, [market](../m/market.md) corrections, and company-specific issues can lead to significant fluctuations in the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [value](../v/value.md).

## Investment Strategy

### Diversification
[Mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) funds achieve [diversification](../d/diversification.md) by [investing](../i/investing.md) in a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) companies across various sectors. This helps to mitigate the risks associated with [investing](../i/investing.md) in a single company or [industry](../i/industry.md).

### Active vs. Passive Management
[Mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) funds can be actively or passively managed. Actively managed funds have a team of professional [fund](../f/fund.md) managers who select [stocks](../s/stock.md) based on research and analysis to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the [market](../m/market.md). Passively managed funds, such as [index](../i/index_instrument.md) funds or ETFs, aim to replicate the performance of a specific [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md), such as the S&P MidCap 400 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Sector Allocation
[Fund](../f/fund.md) managers often allocate investments across different sectors, such as technology, healthcare, and [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md), to take advantage of growth opportunities and manage sector-specific risks.

## Performance Metrics

### Net Asset Value (NAV)
The Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) (NAV) represents the per-share [value](../v/value.md) of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets minus liabilities. It is calculated at the end of each trading day and is an essential metric for assessing the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s performance.

### Expense Ratio
The [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md) measures the annual fees charged by the [fund](../f/fund.md) expressed as a percentage of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s average assets. A lower [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md) is generally more favorable for investors as it reduces the overall cost of investment.

### Turnover Ratio
The [turnover ratio](../t/turnover_ratio.md) indicates the frequency with which a [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [holdings](../h/holdings.md) are bought and sold during a year. A higher [turnover ratio](../t/turnover_ratio.md) may lead to higher [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and tax liabilities for investors.

## Advantages

### Growth Opportunities
[Mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) funds provide access to companies that are often in their growth phase, [offering](../o/offering.md) the potential for substantial returns.

### Diversification
[Investing](../i/investing.md) in a [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) offers [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md), reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with holding individual [mid-cap stocks](../m/mid-cap_stocks.md).

### Professional Management
For actively managed funds, investors benefit from the expertise of professional [fund](../f/fund.md) managers who conduct research and make informed investment decisions.

## Risks

### Market Risk
[Mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) funds are subject to [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), meaning the [value](../v/value.md) of the investments can fluctuate based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Liquidity Risk
[Mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) companies may have less [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) compared to large-cap companies, making it difficult to buy or sell [shares](../s/shares.md) without affecting the stock price.

### Company-Specific Risk
[Mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) companies may face challenges such as management changes, regulatory issues, or competitive pressures, which can impact their stock price.

## Comparison with Other Funds

### Large-Cap Funds
Large-cap funds invest in companies with [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations exceeding $10 billion. These companies are typically more stable and less volatile than [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) companies but [offer](../o/offer.md) lower growth potential.

### Small-Cap Funds
Small-cap funds invest in companies with [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations below $2 billion. These companies [offer](../o/offer.md) higher growth potential but come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) and large-cap funds.

### Blend Funds
Blend funds invest in a mix of large-cap, [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md), and small-cap companies, providing exposure to different company sizes and growth stages.
