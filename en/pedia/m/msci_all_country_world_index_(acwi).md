- **[Float](../f/float.md) Adjustment**: [Market](../m/market.md) caps are adjusted based on the [float](../f/float.md), excluding closely held [shares](../s/shares.md) to better reflect the investment opportunities available to public investors.
- **[Quarterly Rebalancing](../q/quarterly_rebalancing.md)**: The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is reviewed and rebalanced on a quarterly [basis](../b/basis.md) to ensure that it remains representative of the current [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
- **Review of Constituents**: The inclusion and exclusion of [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) are based on MSCI's Global Investable [Market](../m/market.md) Indexes Methodology, which analyzes criteria such as [market](../m/market.md) size, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and inclusion in the IMI (Investable [Market Index](../m/market_index.md)).

For institutional investors, the MSCI ACWI offers a framework for strategic [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) across global [equity](../e/equity.md) markets. By understanding the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)’s composition and allocations, investors can create diversified portfolios that aim to optimize returns while managing [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covering both developed and emerging markets, the MSCI ACWI provides broad exposure to the global [equity market](../e/equity_market.md).
2. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) includes a diversified list of companies across various sectors and countries, which helps to mitigate portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md).
3. **Standardization**: It offers a standardized [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) that investors worldwide can use for performance comparison.

### Limitations

1. **[Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) Weighting**: Larger companies have a disproportionate impact on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)’s performance, which might skew returns in favor of mega-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md).
2. **Emerging [Market Exposure](../m/market_exposure.md)**: While the inclusion of emerging markets is a strength, it can also introduce additional [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) due to [market](../m/market.md) and geopolitical factors.
3. **[Currency](../c/currency.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Investors in the MSCI ACWI are exposed to [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) since the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) includes [stocks](../s/stock.md) from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) countries with different currencies.

## Performance Metrics

### Risk Metrics

1. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: The [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of returns is a common measure of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)’s [volatility](../v/volatility.md). The MSCI ACWI tends to experience [variability](../v/variability.md) due to its exposure to different countries' [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).
2. **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**: This ratio helps investors understand the [return](../r/return.md) of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) relative to its [risk](../r/risk.md). A higher [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) indicates better [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.
3. **[Beta](../b/beta.md)**: By comparing the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)’s [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to a specific [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) like the MSCI World [Index](../i/index_instrument.md), investors can gauge its sensitivity to [market](../m/market.md) movements.
