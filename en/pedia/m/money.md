# Money

Money is an essential [medium of exchange](../m/medium_of_exchange.md) that facilitates [trade](../t/trade.md), serves as a [store of value](../s/store_of_value.md), and acts as a unit of account. Throughout history, various forms of money have evolved, each playing a critical role in the development of economies and financial systems. This article aims to explore the concept of money, its historical evolution, types, characteristics, and its significant role within the contexts of modern [finance](../f/finance.md) and fintech.

## Historical Evolution of Money

### Barter System

Before money existed, people relied on the [barter](../b/barter.md) system to conduct transactions. In bartering, goods and services were exchanged directly for other goods and services. Despite its simplicity, the [barter](../b/barter.md) system had significant limitations:
- Double coincidence of wants: Both parties needed to want what the other offered.
- Lack of a common measure of [value](../v/value.md): It was challenging to determine the [value](../v/value.md) of one good/service in terms of another.
- Indivisibility of goods: Some items could not be easily divided for smaller transactions.

### Commodity Money

To overcome the limitations of [barter](../b/barter.md), [commodity](../c/commodity.md) money emerged. [Commodity](../c/commodity.md) money included items with [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) such as gold, silver, copper, cattle, and grains. These commodities served as a [medium of exchange](../m/medium_of_exchange.md) and held [value](../v/value.md) independently of their use as money. However, issues like divisibility and portability still posed challenges.

### Metallic Money

As societies progressed, metals such as gold and silver were standardized into coins. These metallic coins were durable, divisible, and portable, making them an effective [medium of exchange](../m/medium_of_exchange.md). Governments began minting coins with specific weights and values, which helped in building [trust](../t/trust.md) and standardizing transactions.

### Paper Money

[Paper money](../p/paper_money.md) was introduced as a more convenient alternative to metal coins. Initially, [paper money](../p/paper_money.md) was backed by [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md), such as gold reserves. Governments issued paper notes as a promise to pay the bearer the equivalent [value](../v/value.md) in gold or silver. This system, known as representative money, facilitated larger transactions without the need to carry heavy coins.

### Fiat Money

In the 20th century, most countries shifted from the [gold standard](../g/gold_standard.md) to [fiat money](../f/fiat_money.md). [Fiat money](../f/fiat_money.md) is [currency](../c/currency.md) that has no [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) and is not backed by physical commodities. Its [value](../v/value.md) is derived from government decree and the [trust](../t/trust.md) that individuals place in its [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md). Modern economies rely heavily on [fiat money](../f/fiat_money.md) for transactions and economic stability.

### Digital Money

With the advent of technology, [digital money](../d/digital_money.md) has revolutionized the financial landscape. [Digital money](../d/digital_money.md) includes various forms like electronic funds, cryptocurrencies, and central [bank](../b/bank.md) digital currencies (CBDCs). The rise of [digital money](../d/digital_money.md) has transformed how transactions are conducted, [offering](../o/offering.md) speed, [security](../s/security.md), and global accessibility.

## Types of Money

### Commodity Money

[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) money is backed by physical goods (e.g., gold, silver). Its [value](../v/value.md) is inherently linked to the [commodity](../c/commodity.md) it represents. While it addresses some limitations of [barter](../b/barter.md), its practical usage for large-scale transactions remains limited in modern economies.

### Fiat Money

[Fiat money](../f/fiat_money.md) has no [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) but is established as [legal tender](../l/legal_tender.md) by government regulation. Examples include the US Dollar, [Euro](../e/euro.md), and Yen. Its [value](../v/value.md) is derived from the [trust](../t/trust.md) and confidence of the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Representative Money

Representative money involves physical tokens (e.g., paper notes) that represent a claim on a [commodity](../c/commodity.md) (e.g., gold, silver). It provides flexibility and ease of transactions while maintaining a link to tangible reserves.

### Digital Money

[Digital money](../d/digital_money.md) encompasses electronic forms of [currency](../c/currency.md), including:
- **Electronic Funds**: Money in digital form used in [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts and electronic payments.
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Decentralized digital currencies like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) based on [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology.
- **CBDCs**: Digital versions of a country's fiat [currency](../c/currency.md) issued and regulated by the central [bank](../b/bank.md).

## Characteristics of Money

For money to function effectively, it must possess certain key characteristics:

### Durability

Money should be able to withstand wear and tear from regular use. Durable materials like metal coins and polymer banknotes are commonly used.

### Portability

Money needs to be easily transportable and convenient for transactions. This includes physical portability (coins and banknotes) and digital transferability.

### Divisibility

Money must be divisible into smaller units to facilitate transactions of varying values. For example, currencies can be broken into coins, banknotes, or digital fractions.

### Uniformity

Units of money should be consistent in [value](../v/value.md) and appearance, making them easily recognizable and acceptable for transactions.

### Acceptability

Money should be widely accepted as a [medium of exchange](../m/medium_of_exchange.md) within an [economy](../e/economy.md). Acceptability is often enforced by government regulations and societal [trust](../t/trust.md).

### Stability

The [value](../v/value.md) of money should remain relatively stable over time to effectively serve as a [store of value](../s/store_of_value.md). [Inflation](../i/inflation.md) and [deflation](../d/deflation.md) can erode money's [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md).
