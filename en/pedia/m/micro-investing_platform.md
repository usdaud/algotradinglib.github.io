# Micro-Investing Platform

Micro-[investing](../i/investing.md) platforms are financial technology (fintech) innovations that allow individuals to invest small amounts of [money](../m/money.md), often just spare change, into various investment assets. These platforms aim to make investment accessible to a broader audience, particularly those who may not have significant [capital](../c/capital.md) to invest or who are new to the world of [investing](../i/investing.md).

One of the hallmark features of micro-[investing](../i/investing.md) platforms is the ability to invest spare change. Users link their [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts or [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, and the platform rounds up their purchases to the nearest dollar, [investing](../i/investing.md) the difference. This process turns everyday spending into an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md).

### 2. **Automated Savings**
Micro-[investing](../i/investing.md) platforms often include automated savings tools that help users set aside [money](../m/money.md) regularly.
