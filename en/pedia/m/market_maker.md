# Market Maker

A [market](../m/market.md) maker is a [firm](../f/firm.md) or individual who actively quotes two-sided markets in a particular [security](../s/security.md), providing bids and offers (known as asks) along with the [market](../m/market.md) size of each. The role of a [market](../m/market.md) maker is to enhance [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and facilitate the smooth and efficient trading of financial instruments. [Market](../m/market.md) makers play a crucial role in the overall functioning of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) by continuously providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and reducing [volatility](../v/volatility.md). 

## How Market Makers Work

[Market](../m/market.md) makers create a marketplace for buyers and sellers by continuously buying and selling securities at publicly quoted prices. They stand ready to buy or sell at any time, thereby ensuring that investors can [trade](../t/trade.md) the [security](../s/security.md) more easily and with smaller price fluctuations. [Market](../m/market.md) makers make a [profit](../p/profit.md) through the spread, which is the difference between the price at which they buy a [security](../s/security.md) (the [bid](../b/bid.md)) and the price at which they sell it (the ask). 

### Bid-Ask Spread

The [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md) is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a [security](../s/security.md) and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. [Market](../m/market.md) makers [profit](../p/profit.md) from this spread, but they also bear the [risk](../r/risk.md) of holding the [security](../s/security.md) for a period of time due to price fluctuations. 

For example, if the [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) for a [security](../s/security.md) is $100 and the ask price is $101, the [market](../m/market.md) maker can buy at $100 and sell at $101, making a $1 [profit](../p/profit.md) per unit sold. However, if the [security](../s/security.md)'s price drops to $99 while the [market](../m/market.md) maker holds it, they would incur a loss if they had to sell it at that price.

## Role in Different Markets

[Market](../m/market.md) makers operate in various types of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), including [stocks](../s/stock.md), [options](../o/options.md), and [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) (forex) markets.

### Stock Market

In the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), [market](../m/market.md) makers are typically large financial institutions or banks. They provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by being ready to buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md) of publicly traded companies. The New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) and [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) are two examples of exchanges where [market](../m/market.md) makers play a crucial role.

### Options Market

In the [options](../o/options.md) [market](../m/market.md), [market](../m/market.md) makers provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by [offering](../o/offering.md) to buy or sell [options](../o/options.md) contracts. Firms like Citadel Securities and Susquehanna International Group are some examples of [market](../m/market.md) makers in [options](../o/options.md) trading. These firms ensure that [options](../o/options.md) can be traded quickly and efficiently, enabling investors to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) risks or speculate on price movements.

### Forex Market

In the forex [market](../m/market.md), [market](../m/market.md) makers (often large financial institutions and banks) provide quotes for [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs. They guarantee that there's an available [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) for every [trade](../t/trade.md), making it easier for traders to enter and exit positions. Firms like JP Morgan and Citibank are notable [market](../m/market.md) makers in forex trading.

## Advantages of Market Makers

### Enhanced Liquidity

One of the primary advantages of [market](../m/market.md) makers is that they provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the markets where they operate. Enhanced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) ensures that investors can buy or sell securities more easily, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of price manipulation and enhancing [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md).

### Reduced Volatility

By continuously quoting buy and sell prices, [market](../m/market.md) makers help to stabilize prices and reduce [volatility](../v/volatility.md). They absorb imbalances between buy and sell orders, which would otherwise cause significant price swings.

### Narrower Spreads

[Market](../m/market.md) makers contribute to narrowing the [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md), making trading less expensive for investors. This benefits both retail and institutional traders by reducing [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

### Quick Execution

[Market](../m/market.md) makers facilitate quick and efficient [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades. This minimizes the time and [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) involved in trading and ensures that investors can execute their strategies in a timely manner.

## Disadvantages and Risks

### Conflicts of Interest

[Market](../m/market.md) makers may face conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md) since they have access to a lot of [market](../m/market.md) information. They might use this information to their advantage, potentially leading to practices like [front-running](../f/front-running.md).

### Risk Bearing

[Market](../m/market.md) makers bear the [risk](../r/risk.md) of holding [inventory](../i/inventory.md) in a volatile [market](../m/market.md). Adverse price movements can lead to significant losses, especially if the spread is not sufficient to compensate for the [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Regulation and Compliance

[Market](../m/market.md) makers are subject to regulatory scrutiny and must comply with various rules and standards set by regulatory bodies. This can impose additional costs and operational challenges.
