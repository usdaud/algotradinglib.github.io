# Make Whole Call Provision

The Make Whole Call [Provision](../p/provision.md) is a feature embedded in certain types of [bond](../b/bond.md) agreements which allows the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to repay the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of the [bond](../b/bond.md) before its scheduled [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md). This [provision](../p/provision.md) compensates bondholders for the lost [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and potential opportunity costs because of the early [repayment](../r/repayment.md). Essentially, it ensures that bondholders receive a "make-whole amount," which is intended to make them economically indifferent to the call.

## Overview

The make-whole call clause is primarily found in corporate bonds but can sometimes be seen in municipal and government-issued bonds. It is designed to protect investors by requiring the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to pay a [premium](../p/premium.md), which is generally the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the remaining [interest](../i/interest.md) payments that would have been received if the [bond](../b/bond.md) had not been called early. This feature contrasts with more traditional call provisions, where the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) pays a predetermined price, often just slightly higher than the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [face value](../f/face_value.md), to redeem the [bond](../b/bond.md) early.

## Calculation of Make-Whole Amount

The calculation of the make-whole amount involves several components and typically includes:

1. **[Treasury Yield](../t/treasury_yield.md)**: The [yield](../y/yield.md) on a [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [security](../s/security.md) of comparable [maturity](../m/maturity.md) to the [bond](../b/bond.md) being called. This is often used as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for determining the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) in the [present value](../p/present_value.md) calculation.
2. **Spread**: An additional number of [basis](../b/basis.md) points added to the [Treasury yield](../t/treasury_yield.md). The spread compensates the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) for the higher [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with corporate bonds compared to relatively [risk](../r/risk.md)-free Treasury securities.
3. **Remaining Coupon Payments**: The sum of all future coupon payments that the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) would have received had the [bond](../b/bond.md) not been called early.
4. **[Discount](../d/discount.md) [Factor](../f/factor.md)**: The rate used to [discount](../d/discount.md) future coupon payments and the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount back to their [present value](../p/present_value.md).

The formula for calculating the make-whole amount can typically be expressed as:

\[ \text{Make-Whole Amount} = \left( \sum \frac{\text{Coupon Payment}}{(1 + \text{[Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md)})^t} \right) + \frac{\text{[Principal](../p/principal.md)}}{(1 + \text{[Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md)})^T} \]

Where:
- Coupon [Payment](../p/payment.md) = Periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments
- [Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md) = [Treasury Yield](../t/treasury_yield.md) + Spread
- t = Time period under consideration
- T = Total time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md)

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits to Issuers
- **Flexibility**: The [provision](../p/provision.md) allows issuers the flexibility to repay [debt](../d/debt.md) when [market](../m/market.md) conditions are favorable or when they have [surplus](../s/surplus.md) cash.
- **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Management**: It aids in the management of their overall [debt](../d/debt.md) [load](../l/load.md) and the [cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md) by refinancing at lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Benefits to Bondholders
- **Compensation**: Bondholders are adequately compensated for the loss of future [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.
- **Reduced [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: The premiums make early [redemption](../r/redemption.md) less attractive to issuers, thereby providing some additional [assurance](../a/assurance.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s tenure.

### Drawbacks to Issuers
- **Higher Cost**: The make-whole amount can be expensive, especially if the [bond](../b/bond.md) was issued when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates were significantly higher than at the time the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) wants to call the [bond](../b/bond.md).
- **Complexity**: The [provision](../p/provision.md) introduces additional complexity regarding the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s terms and conditions, potentially making it less attractive to some investors.

### Drawbacks to Bondholders
- **[Prepayment Risk](../p/prepayment_risk.md)**: Although compensated, bondholders still face [prepayment risk](../p/prepayment_risk.md) and may need to reinvest the make-whole amount in a lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment.
- **Calculation Complexity**: The process for calculating the make-whole amount can be complex, and variations in terms in different [bond](../b/bond.md) agreements can lead to different results.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Corporate Bond
A [corporation](../c/corporation.md) issues a [10-year bond](../1/10-year_bond.md) with a 5% [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md) and an embedded make-whole call [provision](../p/provision.md). After five years, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates have fallen to 3%, and the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) decides to call the [bond](../b/bond.md). The U.S. [Treasury yield](../t/treasury_yield.md) for a 5-year [bond](../b/bond.md) (the remaining period) is 2%, and the agreed spread is 50 [basis](../b/basis.md) points. The make-whole amount compensates bondholders by ensuring they receive the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the remaining coupons plus the [principal](../p/principal.md), discounted at the [Treasury yield](../t/treasury_yield.md) plus the spread (2% + 0.5%).

### Example 2: Municipal Bond
A municipality issues a [20-year bond](../1/20-year_bond.md) with a 4% [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md) and an embedded make-whole call [provision](../p/provision.md). After ten years, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates have fallen, and the municipality considers calling the [bond](../b/bond.md). The make-whole [provision](../p/provision.md) requires the municipality to pay a [premium](../p/premium.md) equivalent to the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the remaining 4% coupons and the [principal](../p/principal.md), discounted at the relevant [Treasury yield](../t/treasury_yield.md) plus the spread.

## Real-World Applications

### Apple Inc.
Apple Inc. issued corporate bonds with make-whole call provisions. In case of early [repayment](../r/repayment.md), Apple would compensate the bondholders with a make-whole amount. More detailed information on their corporate bonds can be found on Apple’s [company filings](../i/investor_relations.md) page.

### Microsoft Corporation
Microsoft [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s [bond](../b/bond.md) issues often include make-whole call provisions to provide flexibility in [debt](../d/debt.md) management../i/investor_relations.md) page.

## Key Considerations

### Interpretation of Terms
The specifics of make-whole call provisions can vary significantly. [Bond](../b/bond.md) issuers and investors need to carefully understand the terms described in the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [indenture](../i/indenture.md), including how the [Treasury yield](../t/treasury_yield.md) and spread are determined and any additional conditions that may apply.

### Market Conditions
Make-whole call provisions become particularly relevant in changing [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environments. A thorough understanding of potential [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements and the associated risks and rewards is crucial for both issuers and investors.

### Legal and Regulatory Aspects
Issuers need to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Legal clarity regarding the implementation of make-whole call provisions can prevent disputes and ensure smooth financial operations.

## Conclusion

The make-whole call [provision](../p/provision.md) represents a sophisticated mechanism in the [bond market](../b/bond_market.md) to balance the interests of both issuers and bondholders. By requiring issuers to compensate bondholders adequately when calling the [bond](../b/bond.md) early, it protects investors from potential losses while providing issuers the flexibility to manage their financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) effectively. Understanding this [provision](../p/provision.md)'s nuances is essential for any participant in the [bond market](../b/bond_market.md), from corporate treasurers to individual investors, as it plays a crucial role in [debt](../d/debt.md) management and investment strategies.
