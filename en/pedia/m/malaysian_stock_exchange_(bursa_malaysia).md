# Malaysian Stock Exchange (Bursa Malaysia)

The **Malaysian Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)**, officially known as **Bursa Malaysia**, is the main stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in Malaysia. It provides a platform for traders and investors to buy and sell a wide [range](../r/range.md) of securities such as equities, [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs), [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment Trusts (REITs), and Islamic products. As a critical component of Malaysia's financial ecosystem, Bursa Malaysia plays an essential role in the country’s economic development by facilitating [capital](../c/capital.md) formation and promoting [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## History and Evolution

Bursa Malaysia was established in 1964 as the Kuala Lumpur Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (KLSE). Over the years, the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) underwent several transformations. The most significant change came in 2004 when KLSE was demutualized, resulting in its transformation into Bursa Malaysia. This [demutualization](../d/demutualization.md) aimed to enhance the [exchange](../e/exchange.md)’s competitiveness and attract more foreign investments.

## Structure and Organization

Bursa Malaysia is composed of various [market](../m/market.md) sectors, each serving specific segments of the [economy](../e/economy.md). The main sectors include the Main [Market](../m/market.md), the ACE [Market](../m/market.md), and the LEAP [Market](../m/market.md).

1. **Main [Market](../m/market.md)** - This is the primary segment of Bursa Malaysia where large-cap companies are [listed](../l/listed.md). It includes both domestic and international companies that meet stringent regulatory requirements.

2. **ACE [Market](../m/market.md)** - This sector is designed for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with growth potential. It allows these companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure.

3. **LEAP [Market](../m/market.md)** - Launched in 2017, the LEAP (Leading [Entrepreneur](../e/entrepreneur.md) Accelerator Platform) [Market](../m/market.md) caters to the needs of emerging companies by providing them with a platform to raise funds and grow their [business](../b/business.md).

## Types of Securities Traded
