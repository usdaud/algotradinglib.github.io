# Moral Hazard

**Moral Hazard** is a term used in [economics](../e/economics.md), [finance](../f/finance.md), and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) to describe situations where one party can take risks because another party bears the consequences. This term is relevant in various fields such as [insurance](../i/insurance.md), banking, and investment because it affects decision-making processes and [risk](../r/risk.md) evaluation.

## Definition

Moral Hazard arises when a party is incentivized to take undue risks because they do not have to face the full consequences of their actions. This creates a disconnection between the interests of different stakeholders, leading to suboptimal outcomes and potentially significant economic inefficiencies. For instance, when employees are covered under a comprehensive [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) plan, they might be less likely to care about their health service costs, which they otherwise would have monitored if they had to bear the entire [expense](../e/expense.md).

## Types and Examples

### Insurance

One of the most cited examples of moral hazard is within the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [industry](../i/industry.md). Once insured, individuals may engage in riskier behavior because they do not bear the cost of failure. For example, a person with comprehensive car [insurance](../i/insurance.md) might be less cautious about parking in a high-[risk](../r/risk.md) area because any damage would be covered by [insurance](../i/insurance.md).

### Banking

The [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008 highlighted moral hazard in the banking [industry](../i/industry.md). Banks engaged in riskier lending and investment practices, relying on the assumption that the government would bail them out if things went awry. This notion of "[too big to fail](../t/too_big_to_fail.md)" indicated that banks did not bear the full [risk](../r/risk.md) of their actions.

### Employment

In corporate structures, employees might exhibit moral hazard behaviors in several ways. For example, salespeople might oversell or misrepresent products, knowing that any [customer](../c/customer.md) dissatisfaction would be dealt with by a different department. In such cases, the salesperson does not directly face the repercussions of lost [customer](../c/customer.md) [trust](../t/trust.md).

## The Principal-Agent Problem

Moral hazard is closely tied to the [principal-agent problem](../p/principal-agent_problem.md), which occurs when one party (the agent) makes decisions on behalf of another (the [principal](../p/principal.md)) but has different incentives. This misalignment can lead to agents making decisions that are not in the best [interest](../i/interest.md) of the principals. For example, a company's executives might focus on short-term gains (e.g., bonuses) that benefit them personally but are detrimental to the company's long-term health.

## Mitigating Moral Hazard

Addressing moral hazard typically involves aligning interests and creating mechanisms that ensure both parties bear some [risk](../r/risk.md) and have incentives to act responsibly. Some methods include:

### Incentive Structures

Aligning the compensation of executives with the long-term performance of the company can discourage behavior that seeks short-term gains at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of long-term health.

### Deductibles and Co-pays

In [insurance](../i/insurance.md), introducing deductibles and co-pays ensures that policyholders have a financial stake in minimizing claims, reducing the likelihood of risky behavior.

### Monitoring and Reporting

Enhanced monitoring and transparent reporting can ensure that actions and outcomes are closely tracked. For instance, regular audits and performance reviews can help identify and mitigate risky behaviors early.

### Regulation and Oversight

Government regulations and oversight bodies can ensure that entities do not engage in excessively risky behavior. Decisions such as implementing banking regulations to prevent overly high [leverage](../l/leverage.md) are examples of this.

## Conclusion

Moral hazard is a critical concept in understanding decision-making behavior in contexts where [risk](../r/risk.md) is borne by different parties than those who make the [risk](../r/risk.md)-related decisions. Addressing these issues requires a mixture of strategic organizational changes, regulatory frameworks, and financial incentives to ensure aligned interests and responsible behavior.

Understanding and mitigating moral hazard is essential for ensuring [economic efficiency](../e/economic_efficiency.md) and fairness—be it in the realms of [insurance](../i/insurance.md), banking, [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), or other fields where [risk](../r/risk.md) is a fundamental concern.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Moral Hazard and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.
