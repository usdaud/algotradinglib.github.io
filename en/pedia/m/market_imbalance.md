# Market Imbalance

Market imbalance is a mismatch between buying and selling interest in a market. It can refer to orders resting in the book, executed volume, or auction interest at a specific time.

## Sources of imbalance
- Order book imbalance where bids outweigh offers or the reverse.
- Auction imbalance during opening or closing crosses.
- Trade imbalance where aggressive buys exceed aggressive sells.

## Why it matters
Strong imbalance can push prices as one side dominates. Imbalances are often watched around the open, close, and major news events.

## Example
A closing auction shows a large net buy imbalance. Traders anticipate upward pressure and adjust positions ahead of the close.

## Practical notes
Imbalance data can change quickly as orders are added or canceled. It should be used with liquidity and volatility context.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Market Imbalance and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Market Imbalance as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Market Imbalance, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Market Imbalance. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Market Imbalance alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
