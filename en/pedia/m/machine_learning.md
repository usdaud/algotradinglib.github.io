# Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a broad field of [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) that focuses on algorithms and statistical models enabling computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions.

### Key Components
- **Algorithms:** Includes [decision trees](../d/decision_trees.md), [support vector machines](../s/support_vector_machines_in_trading.md), k-nearest neighbors, and ensemble methods.
- **Feature Engineering:** The process of selecting and transforming data inputs.
- **Model Training:** Using data to adjust model parameters and learn patterns.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., used to assess model performance.

### Applications
- **Recommendation Systems:** Personalizing content on platforms like Netflix and Amazon.
- **[Fraud](../f/fraud.md) Detection:** Identifying anomalies in financial transactions.
- **[Predictive Analytics](../p/predictive_analytics.md):** [Forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) trends in industries such as [finance](../f/finance.md) and healthcare.
- **[Natural Language Processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md):** Classification and [sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md).

### Advantages
- Can uncover hidden patterns in data.
- Widely applicable across various domains.
- Provides automated decision-making capabilities.

### Challenges
- Quality of data critically affects outcomes.
- [Risk](../r/risk.md) of [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md) if models are too complex.
- Requires domain expertise for proper feature selection and interpretation.

### Future Outlook
The future of ML involves greater integration with [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md), increased automation via [AutoML](../a/automl.md), and enhanced interpretability and fairness in models.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Machine Learning and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Machine Learning as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Machine Learning, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Machine Learning. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Machine Learning alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
