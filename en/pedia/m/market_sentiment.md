# Market Sentiment

[Market](../m/market.md) sentiment refers to the overall attitude or feeling that investors and traders have regarding the anticipated price movement of a [market](../m/market.md) or [asset](../a/asset.md). This sentiment can be either bullish, indicating optimism and expectations for price increases, or bearish, indicating pessimism and expectations for price declines. Understanding [market](../m/market.md) sentiment is crucial for traders as it can significantly influence trading decisions and strategies.

## Types of Market Sentiment

### Bullish Sentiment

When [market](../m/market.md) participants are optimistic about future price movements, the sentiment is termed as 'bullish.' This sentiment usually leads to a buying spree, causing prices to rise. Bullish sentiment might be driven by various factors such as positive [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), favorable news about a company, or general [market](../m/market.md) optimism.

### Bearish Sentiment

Conversely, bearish sentiment occurs when investors are pessimistic about future price movements. This often leads to selling pressure, causing prices to fall. Bearish sentiment can be triggered by negative news, poor economic data, or a general downturn in [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Indicators of Market Sentiment

### Market Indexes

[Market](../m/market.md) indexes, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, or [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite, often serve as broad indicators of [market](../m/market.md) sentiment. A rising [index](../i/index_instrument.md) generally indicates bullish sentiment, while a falling [index](../i/index_instrument.md) suggests bearish sentiment.

### Sentiment Surveys

Many organizations conduct [sentiment surveys](../s/sentiment_surveys.md) to gauge the mood of investors. Surveys like the American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) Sentiment Survey provide insights into whether investors are feeling bullish, bearish, or [neutral](../n/neutral.md) about the [market](../m/market.md).

### Volume and Breadth Indicators

[Volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) measure the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) traded. High volumes on rising prices usually indicate strong bullish sentiment, whereas high volumes on falling prices indicate strong bearish sentiment. Breadth indicators, such as the Advance/Decline line, track the number of advancing versus declining [stocks](../s/stock.md) and provide further insights into [market](../m/market.md) sentiment.

### Put/Call Ratio

The put/call ratio is a popular sentiment [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that measures the [volume](../v/volume.md) of [put options](../p/put_options.md) traded relative to call [options](../o/options.md). A high put/call ratio suggests bearish sentiment, while a low put/call ratio indicates bullish sentiment.

### VIX (Volatility Index)

The VIX, often referred to as the "fear gauge," measures [market](../m/market.md) expectations of near-term [volatility](../v/volatility.md). A rising VIX indicates increasing fear or [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) among investors, suggesting bearish sentiment, while a falling VIX points to complacency or optimism, suggesting bullish sentiment.

## Sentiment Analysis Techniques
