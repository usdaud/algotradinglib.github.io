# Managed Futures

Managed [futures](../f/futures.md) is an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) that involves taking both long and short positions in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), along with other [derivative](../d/derivative.md) products. This strategy is executed within a [managed account](../m/managed_account.md) or pooled [fund](../f/fund.md), operated by professional [money](../m/money.md) managers known as [commodity trading advisors](../c/commodity_trading_advisors_(ctas).md) (CTAs) or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) pool operators (CPOs). These professionals utilize a variety of strategies, including [trend](../t/trend.md)-following, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), and [systematic trading](../s/systematic_trading.md), leveraging their expertise to potentially [profit](../p/profit.md) from movements in the prices of commodities, financial instruments, and other assets.

## Historical Context
The concept of managed [futures](../f/futures.md) dates back to the 1970s when the trading of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) was primarily centered around agricultural commodities. Over the decades, the [market](../m/market.md) has expanded to include financial [futures](../f/futures.md), such as stock [index futures](../i/index_futures.md), [interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md), and [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) contracts. This [diversification](../d/diversification.md) has facilitated the evolution of managed [futures](../f/futures.md) as a [robust](../r/robust.md) [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) capable of providing [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md) and potential returns uncorrelated with traditional [asset](../a/asset.md) classes like [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds.

## Key Players in Managed Futures
- **Institutional Investors**: Pension funds, endowments, and foundations have increasingly incorporated managed [futures](../f/futures.md) into their investment portfolios, seeking to enhance [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and reduce overall portfolio [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- **[Commodity Trading Advisors](../c/commodity_trading_advisors_(ctas).md) (CTAs)**: Registered with the [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC) and members of the National [Futures](../f/futures.md) Association (NFA), CTAs are the primary managers of managed [futures](../f/futures.md) accounts. They employ various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), often utilizing algorithmic models and [quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) to make informed trading decisions.
- **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Pool Operators (CPOs)**: These entities pool funds from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors to [trade](../t/trade.md) in [futures](../f/futures.md) and commodities markets, providing individual investors access to managed [futures](../f/futures.md) strategies that they might not have achieved on their own.

## Trading Strategies
### Trend Following
[Trend](../t/trend.md)-following is one of the most popular and widely used strategies in managed [futures](../f/futures.md). It relies on the premise that markets often move in trends, which can be exploited by taking positions in the direction of the prevailing [market](../m/market.md) movement. [Trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategies typically involve:
- **Moving Averages**: Utilizing [moving average crossovers](../m/moving_average_crossovers.md) to identify trends.
- **[Momentum Indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md)**: Tools like the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD) to spot potential [trade](../t/trade.md) opportunities.

### Arbitrage
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies in managed [futures](../f/futures.md) aim to exploit price discrepancies between related instruments or markets. These opportunities arise from inefficiencies in the markets and can involve:
- **Cash and Carry [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Taking advantage of the difference between the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) and its [futures](../f/futures.md) price.
- **Inter-[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Spread [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Trading price differences between related but not identical commodities, such as Brent [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil.

### Systematic Trading
[Systematic trading](../s/systematic_trading.md) involves the use of [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and algorithms to identify and exploit trading opportunities. These models are based on statistical analysis, [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), and historical data, allowing for:
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Strategies that execute a large number of trades at very high speeds, capitalizing on small price movements.
- **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md)**: [Automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) that follow predefined criteria to execute trades, reducing human error and emotional decision-making.

## Risk Management
Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial in managed [futures](../f/futures.md) due to the [leverage](../l/leverage.md) involved in trading [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). Techniques used to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md) include:
- **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Determining the appropriate amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) to [risk](../r/risk.md) on a single [trade](../t/trade.md).
- **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Automatically closing a position when it reaches a predefined loss threshold.
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Spreading investments across various markets and instruments to reduce exposure to any single [asset](../a/asset.md).

## Performance and Benefits
Managed [futures](../f/futures.md) have historically shown the potential to deliver strong performance, particularly during periods of [market](../m/market.md) stress when traditional [asset](../a/asset.md) classes may [underperform](../u/underperform.md). The benefits of incorporating managed [futures](../f/futures.md) into an investment portfolio include:
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Reducing portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md) through exposure to different markets and [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.
- **Non-[Correlation](../c/correlation.md)**: Providing returns that are not correlated with traditional investments, thereby enhancing the overall [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) profile.
- **[Inflation Hedge](../i/inflation_hedge.md)**: [Offering](../o/offering.md) protection against [inflation](../i/inflation.md), as many [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are linked to physical commodities whose prices tend to rise with [inflation](../i/inflation.md).
