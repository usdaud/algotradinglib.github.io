# Money Purchase Pension Plan

A [Money](../m/money.md) Purchase [Pension Plan](../p/pension_plan.md) (MPPP) is a type of defined contribution retirement plan in which an employer is required to make fixed annual contributions to the plan on behalf of eligible employees. These contributions are typically a percentage of the employee's salary. MPPPs are designed to provide employees with a pool of funds upon retirement, which can be used to generate [income](../i/income.md) over their retirement years. Unlike other types of pension plans, where benefits are determined by factors such as years of service and final salary, the benefits received from a [Money](../m/money.md) Purchase [Pension Plan](../p/pension_plan.md) depend largely on the investment performance of the contributions made.

## Features of Money Purchase Pension Plan

### Fixed Contributions
One of the key features of an MPPP is that the employer must contribute a fixed amount to the plan each year. This amount is usually specified as a percentage of the employee's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and is stipulated in the plan document. For example, an employer might contribute 10% of an employee's salary to the MPPP annually.

### Investment Risk
In an MPPP, the investment [risk](../r/risk.md) is borne by the employee, not the employer. The contributions made by the employer are invested in various assets such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or mutual funds. The performance of these investments determines the final amount available in the employee's account at the time of retirement. Unlike defined benefit plans, where the employer commits to providing a certain level of retirement [income](../i/income.md), the retirement benefits in an MPPP can vary.

### Tax Benefits
Both employers and employees can receive tax advantages from contributions to a [Money](../m/money.md) Purchase [Pension Plan](../p/pension_plan.md). Employer contributions are generally tax-deductible [business](../b/business.md) expenses, and employees do not pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on these contributions or on the investment [earnings](../e/earnings.md) in their accounts until they withdraw the [money](../m/money.md), typically after they retire.

### Vesting
[Vesting](../v/vesting.md) refers to the employee's right to the employer contributions made to their retirement account. Many MPPPs have a [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule, which means that employees become entitled to the employer contributions gradually over a period of time. For instance, an employee might become 100% vested after five years of service, meaning they have full ownership of the contributions made by the employer at that point.

### Portability
When an employee changes jobs, they can often transfer their [money](../m/money.md) purchase [pension plan](../p/pension_plan.md) balance to another retirement plan or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), ensuring the continuity of their retirement savings. This portability feature enhances the flexibility for employees who might change employers [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times over their careers.

## Comparison with Other Pension Plans

### Defined Benefit Plans
In a defined benefit plan, the employer promises to pay a specific monthly benefit upon retirement, which is typically based on factors like salary history and years of service. The employer bears the investment [risk](../r/risk.md) and is responsible for ensuring that there are enough funds to pay the promised benefits. In contrast, an MPPP does not promise a specific benefit at retirement; the actual benefit depends on the investment performance of the contributions made.

### 401(k) Plans
Both MPPPs and 401(k) plans are defined contribution plans, meaning the final benefit depends on the contributions made and the investment returns. However, 401(k) plans often allow employee contributions, whereas MPPPs typically involve contributions solely from the employer. Additionally, 401(k) plans might [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility regarding contribution amounts and investment choices.

## Benefits of Money Purchase Pension Plans

### Predictability for Employers
Since MPPPs require fixed contributions, employers can easily predict their annual pension-related expenses. This reliability can help with budgeting and [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and makes MPPPs an attractive option for employers looking for stability in their financial commitments to employee retirement plans.

### Encouragement of Employee Retention
[Money](../m/money.md) Purchase Pension Plans can also aid in employee retention. By having a [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule, employees have an incentive to stay with the company longer to become [fully vested](../f/fully_vested.md) and maximize their retirement benefits. Employers can use this feature to reduce [turnover](../t/turnover.md) and retain talented employees.

### Regular Contributions
The requirement for regular, fixed contributions ensures that employees continuously build their retirement savings. This steady accumulation of funds can result in a significant retirement [nest egg](../n/nest_egg.md) over time, especially with favorable investment performance. This consistency fosters disciplined saving for retirement among employees.

## Drawbacks of Money Purchase Pension Plans

### Lack of Flexibility
One disadvantage of MPPPs is their lack of flexibility. Employers must adhere to the fixed contribution requirements even during economic downturns or periods of financial difficulty. This lack of flexibility can pose challenges for businesses facing uncertain [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

### Investment Risk
Since the investment [risk](../r/risk.md) is borne by the employees, [market](../m/market.md) downturns or poor investment performance can result in lower-than-expected retirement savings. Employees may end up with [insufficient funds](../i/insufficient_funds.md) for their retirement if the investments do not perform well, unlike in defined benefit plans where the employer guarantees a certain [payout](../p/payout.md).

### Contribution Limits
The contributions to [Money](../m/money.md) Purchase Pension Plans are subject to annual limits set by the IRS. For 2023, the limit for contributions to defined contribution plans, including MPPPs, is the lesser of 25% of the employee's compensation or $66,000. These limits could inhibit the accumulation of sufficient retirement savings for high-[income](../i/income.md) employees.

## Setting Up a Money Purchase Pension Plan

### Plan Design
Creating a [Money](../m/money.md) Purchase [Pension Plan](../p/pension_plan.md) starts with plan design. Employers need to define the contribution formula, specify eligibility requirements for employees, and outline the [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule. The plan document must detail these requirements and any other provisions that govern the operation of the plan.

### Compliance with Regulations
Employers must ensure that their MPPP complies with the Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act (ERISA) and other relevant regulations. This includes filing necessary documents with the IRS and the Department of Labor, providing participants with required disclosures, and managing the plan in accordance with fiduciary responsibilities.

### Selecting Investments
Selecting the investment [options](../o/options.md) for an MPPP is a critical step. Employers can choose from various investment vehicles such as mutual funds, [stocks](../s/stock.md), and bonds. The chosen investments should align with the retirement goals of the employees and the [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) of the plan participants.

### Administration and Record-Keeping
Once established, the plan requires ongoing administration and record-keeping. Employers can [handle](../h/handle.md) these tasks internally or outsource them to third-party administrators. Record-keeping includes maintaining accurate records of contributions, investment [earnings](../e/earnings.md), and distributions, as well as ensuring compliance with reporting requirements.
