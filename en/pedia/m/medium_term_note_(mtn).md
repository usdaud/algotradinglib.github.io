# Medium Term Note (MTN)

A Medium Term [Note](../n/note.md) (MTN) is a [debt instrument](../d/debt_instrument.md) that typically has a [maturity](../m/maturity.md) period ranging from five to ten years. MTNs are issued under a program that allows issuers to [offer](../o/offer.md) notes continuously to investors through various intermediaries, such as financial institutions or brokers, without needing to produce a fresh [prospectus](../p/prospectus.md) for each [issue](../i/issue.md). This structure provides flexibility and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in raising funds from the [debt](../d/debt.md) markets.

## Structure and Features

### Issuance Program

MTNs are issued under an MTN program, which is a flexible [debt](../d/debt.md) issuance program that enables frequent issuers of [debt](../d/debt.md) to access [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) efficiently. An MTN program allows the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to continuously [offer](../o/offer.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) securities with differing terms and maturities, thereby tailoring the [debt](../d/debt.md) issuance to match the [demand](../d/demand.md) and preferences of investors.

### Maturity Range

The distinguishing feature of MTNs is their [maturity](../m/maturity.md) profile. They generally fall in between short-term [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md) and long-term bonds, typically ranging from five to ten years. However, the exact [maturity](../m/maturity.md) can be customized by the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) within this [range](../r/range.md) to meet the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s needs and investors' preferences.

### Interest Rates

MTNs can be issued with either fixed or floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. In the case of fixed-rate MTNs, the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments (coupons) are set at a fixed rate for the entire life of the [note](../n/note.md). Floating-rate MTNs, on the other hand, have [interest](../i/interest.md) rates that adjust periodically based on [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, such as LIBOR or the US Treasury rates.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

### Denominations

MTNs are issued in various denominations, typically tailored to institutional investors, though they are also accessible to retail investors. The minimum investment may vary, often starting at $100,000 for institutional issues and lower for certain retail-targeted offerings.

### Currency

MTNs can be issued in various currencies, providing issuers the flexibility of tapping into diversified [investor](../i/investor.md) bases and managing [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) according to their funding needs.

## Advantages

### Flexibility and Customization

MTNs provide issuers with the flexibility to structure the notes in terms of size, [maturity](../m/maturity.md), [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md), and [currency](../c/currency.md) to suit their specific [financing](../f/financing.md) needs and [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This customization is one of the key advantages of MTNs over other [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments.

### Reduced Costs

By using an MTN program, issuers can reduce costs associated with frequent issuance of separate [debt](../d/debt.md) offerings. The expenses related to legal, administrative, and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) aspects of each individual [issue](../i/issue.md) can be minimized by having an overarching issuance framework.

### Market Access

An MTN program allows issuers to take advantage of favorable [market](../m/market.md) conditions quickly. Since the basic issuance documentation is already in place, issuers can act swiftly to [issue](../i/issue.md) new MTNs without delays.

### Investor Demand

MTNs attract a broad [range](../r/range.md) of investors, including institutional investors such as pension funds, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, and [asset](../a/asset.md) managers. The ability to tailor maturities and other terms to match [investor](../i/investor.md) demands helps in ensuring successful placements.

## Disadvantages

### Market Risks

MTNs carry [market](../m/market.md) risks, including [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) and [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). Changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can affect the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of fixed-rate MTNs, while the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) impacts the perceived [risk](../r/risk.md) and thus the [yield](../y/yield.md) demanded by investors.

### Complexity

The customization and flexibility of MTNs come with complexity for both issuers and investors. Understanding the specific terms of each MTN and how they align with investment goals requires [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md).

### Liquidity

Although MTNs can be traded on secondary markets, they may not have the same level of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) as more standardized instruments such as government bonds or large corporate bonds. This can make it harder to buy or sell MTNs without affecting their [market price](../m/market_price.md).

## Issuers and Investors

### Issuers

MTNs are commonly issued by a variety of entities, including corporations, financial institutions, governments, and [supranational](../s/supranational.md) organizations. These issuers use MTNs to raise medium-term funding for various purposes, such as refinancing existing debts, [financing](../f/financing.md) projects, or maintaining [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Investors

Investors in MTNs typically include institutional investors like mutual funds, pension funds, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, and banks. These investors are attracted to MTNs due to their [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md), tailored maturities, and competitive yields. Retail investors can also participate through various brokerage platforms.

## Regulatory Environment

### United States

In the United States, MTNs are subject to regulations overseen by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). Issuers must comply with requirements for [offering](../o/offering.md) documentation, disclosures, and periodic reporting. The establishment of an MTN program often requires an initial registration statement, after which individual issuances can be conducted more flexibly.

### Europe

In Europe, MTNs fall under the purview of various regulatory frameworks, including the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and relevant local securities laws. Issuers typically prepare a Base [Prospectus](../p/prospectus.md), which is reviewed by the appropriate national regulatory authority, allowing for streamlined subsequent issuances.

### Asia-Pacific

The regulatory environment in the Asia-Pacific region varies by country. Major financial centers like Hong Kong and Singapore have well-established frameworks for the issuance of MTNs, which are overseen by their respective financial regulatory authorities.

## Examples of MTN Programs

### Supranational Organizations

Organizations like the [World Bank](../w/world_bank.md) and the European Investment [Bank](../b/bank.md) (EIB) also utilize MTN programs to [finance](../f/finance.md) their operations. These institutions benefit from the ability to [issue](../i/issue.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) in various currencies and maturities to support their development and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects globally.

## Conclusion

Medium Term Notes (MTNs) are versatile [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments that [offer](../o/offer.md) both issuers and investors significant benefits in terms of flexibility, cost [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), and [market](../m/market.md) accessibility. While there are associated risks and complexities, the ability to customize the terms of the [debt](../d/debt.md) issuance to meet specific needs makes MTNs a valuable tool in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). The regulatory frameworks governing MTNs ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protect [investor](../i/investor.md) interests, contributing to the overall integrity and functionality of the [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md).

Investors considering MTNs should conduct thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) to understand the specific terms and risks of the instruments they are [investing](../i/investing.md) in, while issuers should evaluate the suitability of an MTN program as part of their broader funding strategy.
