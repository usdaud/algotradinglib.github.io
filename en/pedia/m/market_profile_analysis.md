# Market Profile Analysis

[Market](../m/market.md) Profile Analysis is a powerful tool used by traders and [market](../m/market.md) analysts to understand the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) structure and behavior of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Originating from the [commodities trading](../c/commodities_trading.md) realm in the 1980s, the [Market](../m/market.md) Profile was developed by J. Peter Steidlmayer, a [trader](../t/trader.md) at the Chicago Board of [Trade](../t/trade.md) (CBOT). Unlike traditional charting methods, [Market](../m/market.md) Profile provides a unique way to look at price and [volume](../v/volume.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) over a specific period, [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) that can be invaluable for making trading decisions.

### Basics of Market Profile

At its core, [Market](../m/market.md) Profile is a graphical organization of price and time information that delineates the [market](../m/market.md) activity at different price levels. The idea is to build a [distribution](../d/distribution.md) curve of prices where the [market](../m/market.md) has spent the most time and done the most [business](../b/business.md). Here are the key components:

- **Price Levels**: On the vertical axis, prices are displayed.
- **Time or [Volume](../v/volume.md)**: The horizontal axis typically represents time or [volume](../v/volume.md).
- **TPO (Time Price Opportunity)**: Each [price level](../p/price_level.md) where [market](../m/market.md) activity occurs is marked by a letter or a symbol during a specific time period (often a 30-minute bracket).

### Building the Profile: The TPO Chart

A typical TPO chart is constructed by breaking the trading day into [multiple](../m/multiple.md) time brackets, commonly 30-minute intervals. Each interval (A, B, C, etc.) is plotted against its respective [price level](../p/price_level.md).

#### Example:
Consider a [market](../m/market.md) opening at 100, trading as high as 110, and as low as 90, then closing at 105. If each 30-minute period shows trading activity at these prices, the TPO chart [will](../w/will.md) mark these prices accordingly. The result is a bell-shaped [distribution](../d/distribution.md) graph, indicating the frequency and price levels where most trading occurred.

### Key Concepts

#### Value Area (VA)

The [Value](../v/value.md) Area is the [range](../r/range.md) of price levels where a specified percentage (typically 70%) of the trading activity took place. It signifies the area of significant [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) and helps traders identify [key support and resistance levels](../k/key_support_and_resistance_levels.md).

#### Point of Control (POC)

The Point of Control is the [price level](../p/price_level.md) where the highest amount of trading activity occurred during the specified period. This level is crucial as it represents the [market](../m/market.md)'s fair price for that [duration](../d/duration.md).

#### Initial Balance (IB)

The Initial Balance is the [range](../r/range.md) formed by the first hour of trading. It sets the tone for the rest of the trading day, [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). Breaks above or below this [range](../r/range.md) can signal potential trends or reversals.

#### Single Prints

Single prints are areas where the price spiked quickly without much trading activity, indicating [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies or rapid shifts in sentiment. They can act as future support or resistance levels.

### Analyzing Market Profile

[Market](../m/market.md) Profile isn't just about plotting price levels; it's about interpreting what these distributions mean. Traders look for clues on [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), strength, and potential future moves.

#### Trends and Ranges

By examining the shape of the profile, traders can discern between trending and ranging markets. A D-shaped profile suggests a balanced or ranging [market](../m/market.md), while a P or b-shaped profile indicates trending or imbalanced conditions.

- **D-Shaped Profile**: Balanced [market](../m/market.md)
- **P-Shaped Profile**: [Uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) with weak close
- **b-Shaped Profile**: [Downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) with weak close

#### Volume Profile

While traditional [Market](../m/market.md) Profiles use time as a constant, some traders prefer [Volume Profile](../v/volume_profile.md), which uses [volume](../v/volume.md) as the key metric. [Volume Profile](../v/volume_profile.md) shows where significant trading [volume](../v/volume.md) occurred, adding an extra layer of insight into [market](../m/market.md) behavior.

### Practical Application

[Market](../m/market.md) Profile analysis is widely used by institutional traders and increasingly by retail traders. Its application ranges across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), forex, and commodities.

#### Trading Strategy Integration

1. **Breakouts and Reversals**: By identifying key levels like Initial Balance and [Value](../v/value.md) Area, traders can anticipate potential breakouts or reversals.
2. **[Support and Resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) Levels**: The Point of Control and [Value](../v/value.md) Area High/Low serve as pivotal levels for setting stop-loss and take-profits.
3. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Confirmation**: The shape of the profile helps in confirming ongoing trends or identifying exhaustion points.

### Tools and Software

Several tools and [software platforms](../s/software_platforms_for_trading.md) provide [Market](../m/market.md) Profile charting capabilities. Some of the notable ones include:

- **[Sierra Chart](../s/sierra_chart.md)**: Known for its [robust](../r/robust.md) [market](../m/market.md) analysis tools, including [Market](../m/market.md) Profile charts.
- **[ThinkOrSwim](../t/thinkorswim.md) by TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md)**: Offers comprehensive [Market](../m/market.md) Profile features integrated with other trading tools.
- **[NinjaTrader](../n/ninjatrader.md)**: A popular choice for [futures](../f/futures.md) traders, [offering](../o/offering.md) advanced [Market](../m/market.md) Profile analytics.

### Conclusion

[Market](../m/market.md) Profile Analysis provides a nuanced and in-depth view of [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md), making it an essential tool for advanced traders. By understanding price [distribution](../d/distribution.md) and the balance between [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md), traders can make more informed decisions and enhance their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
