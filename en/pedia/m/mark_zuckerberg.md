# Mark Zuckerberg

Mark Zuckerberg is the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, Inc. Born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg has become one of the most influential figures in technology and [social media](../s/social_media.md).

## Early Life and Education

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg showed a strong [interest](../i/interest.md) in programming from a young age. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy, where he excelled in classical studies and sciences. During high school, he created a music player called the Synapse Media Player, which used [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) to learn users' listening habits. Following his high school education, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University to study computer science and psychology.

## Founding Facebook

In February 2004, while still a student at Harvard, Zuckerberg launched "TheFacebook" from his dormitory room with fellow students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. Initially intended as a [networking](../n/networking.md) site for Harvard students, its rapid growth soon expanded access to other Ivy League universities, and eventually to colleges around the world.

By June 2004, Zuckerberg had relocated the company to Palo Alto, California. The site continued to grow, moving beyond the academic [market](../m/market.md) to anyone over the age of 13 with a valid email address by 2006. The company was officially renamed Facebook in 2005.

## Growth and Development of Facebook

Under Zuckerberg's [leadership](../l/leadership.md), Facebook underwent significant growth and development. A key part of Facebook's [business](../b/business.md) strategy involved acquiring other firms to either eliminate competition or to integrate new features and technologies into the platform. Some significant acquisitions included:

- **Instagram (2012)**: Acquired for $1 billion. Instagram retained its brand and continued to grow, becoming a dominant [social media](../s/social_media.md) platform for photo and video sharing.
- **WhatsApp (2014)**: Acquired for $19 billion. This strategic move allowed Facebook to enter the messaging [market](../m/market.md) more robustly.
- **Oculus VR (2014)**: Acquired for $2 billion. This purchase marked Facebook's entry into [virtual reality](../v/virtual_reality.md).

## Creation of Meta Platforms

In a transformative move reflecting the company's broader vision, Facebook rebranded as Meta Platforms in October 2021. The rebranding symbolizes Zuckerberg's commitment to the "metaverse," a collective virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space. Meta's aim, according to Zuckerberg, is to build immersive digital experiences and augmented reality environments, positioning itself at the forefront of the next computing platform shift.

## Impact and Controversies

### Privacy Issues

Throughout his career, Zuckerberg has been at the center of several controversies, particularly surrounding user privacy and data management. These issues came to a head with the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, in which the data of millions of Facebook users was harvested without their consent and used for political ad targeting. Zuckerberg testified before the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament, facing questions about Facebookâ€™s data practices and the steps the company would take to safeguard user information.

### Influence on Elections

Zuckerberg's platform has also been scrutinized for its impact on elections globally, including the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. Critics argue that Facebook's algorithms and data practices allow for the spread of misinformation and targeted political advertising that can sway public opinion.

### Mental Health and Society

There has been growing concern over the impact of [social media](../s/social_media.md) on mental health, particularly among teenagers. Studies have linked heavy use of platforms like Facebook to issues such as [depression](../d/depression.md) and anxiety. Zuckerberg and Meta are under ongoing pressure to address these concerns and implement more [robust](../r/robust.md) mental health safeguards on their platforms.

## Philanthropy

Beyond his role in technology, Zuckerberg is also a notable philanthropist. In 2010, Zuckerberg signed the Giving Pledge, committing to donate at least half of his [wealth](../w/wealth.md) to philanthropic causes. Along with his wife, Priscilla Chan, he founded the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) in 2015, which focuses on areas such as healthcare, education, and scientific research.
