# Married Put

A married put is an [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) involving the purchase of an [asset](../a/asset.md), typically [stocks](../s/stock.md), and a [put option](../p/put.md) for the same [asset](../a/asset.md). This strategy is used as a [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) technique to protect investors against potential losses. The [put option](../p/put.md) acts as an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy, ensuring that the holder can sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price (the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)), regardless of how much the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) falls.

## Components of a Married Put

### 1. The Underlying Asset
The [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) in a married put is usually a stock but can be any investment instrument for which [options](../o/options.md) exist. It represents the primary investment that the [trader](../t/trader.md) seeks to protect.

### 2. The Put Option
A [put option](../p/put.md) gives its holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specific price (the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) within a specific timeframe. In the context of a married put strategy, the [put option](../p/put.md) is typically “at-the-[money](../m/money.md)” (ATM) or “out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md)” (OTM), meaning the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is close to or slightly below the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### 3. Expiration Date
[Options](../o/options.md) have expiry dates after which they become worthless. The [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) of the [put option](../p/put.md) should be carefully considered in alignment with the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [market](../m/market.md) outlook and [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md).

## How a Married Put Works

To execute a married put, an [investor](../i/investor.md) simultaneously buys [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and a [put option](../p/put.md) for the same number of [shares](../s/shares.md). This essentially locks in a minimum [sale](../s/sale.md) price for the [shares](../s/shares.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) downside protection. The cost of the [put option](../p/put.md), referred to as the [premium](../p/premium.md), is the price paid for this protection.

### Example
Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of Company XYZ at $50 per share and simultaneously purchases an [put option](../p/put.md) for those 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $50, costing $2 per share in premiums:

- Cost of [Shares](../s/shares.md): 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) * $50 = $5,000
- Premiums Paid: 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) * $2 = $200

### Scenarios

#### 1. Market Rises
If the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of XYZ rises to $60, the [put option](../p/put.md) would expire worthless since selling the [shares](../s/shares.md) at $50 wouldn’t make sense. However, the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [profit](../p/profit.md) would be the [gain](../g/gain.md) from the [shares](../s/shares.md) ($60 - $50 = $10 per share) minus the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid:

- [Gain](../g/gain.md) on [Shares](../s/shares.md): 100 * $10 = $1,000
- Premiums Paid: $200
- Net [Gain](../g/gain.md): $1,000 - $200 = $800

#### 2. Market Falls
If the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of XYZ falls to $40, the [investor](../i/investor.md) can still sell the [shares](../s/shares.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $50 using the [put option](../p/put.md). This protects against the downside, resulting in:

- Loss Avoided per Share: $50 ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) - $40 (current [market price](../m/market_price.md)) = $10
- Total Loss Avoided: 100 * $10 = $1,000
- [Net Loss](../n/net_loss.md) (considering [premium](../p/premium.md)): $1,000 (loss avoided) - $200 ([premium](../p/premium.md) paid) = $800

## Advantages of a Married Put

1. **Downside Protection**: The primary advantage of a married put is protection against significant losses.
2. **Unlimited [Upside Potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md)**: Unlike some other protective strategies, a married put still allows for unlimited [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md) in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
3. **Flexibility**: Investors can choose different strike prices and expiration dates to tailor the protection to their [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and [market](../m/market.md) outlook.
4. **Psychological Comfort**: Knowing there is a safety net can reduce the psychological stress during volatile [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Disadvantages of a Married Put

1. **Cost of [Premium](../p/premium.md)**: The cost of the [premium](../p/premium.md) required to purchase the [put option](../p/put.md) can eat into overall returns.
2. **Need for Accuracy**: Poor selection of the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) or [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) can lead to inefficiencies and suboptimal protection.
3. **Complexity**: This strategy might be complicated for beginners who are not familiar with [options](../o/options.md) trading.

## Comparing Married Put with Other Strategies

### 1. Protective Put
While a [protective put](../p/protective_put.md) is similar to a married put, they differ slightly. In a [protective put](../p/protective_put.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a [put option](../p/put.md) on [shares](../s/shares.md) they already own, whereas in a married put, both the [shares](../s/shares.md) and the option are bought simultaneously.

### 2. Covered Call
In a [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) strategy, the [investor](../i/investor.md) sells call [options](../o/options.md) on [shares](../s/shares.md) they own to generate [income](../i/income.md) from premiums. While this can provide some downside protection, it caps the [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md), unlike the married put.

### 3. Collar
A [collar](../c/collar.md) involves holding the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock, buying a [put option](../p/put.md), and selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md). This strategy limits both downside and [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md), making it more conservative compared to a married put.

## Real-World Application

### Institutional Investors
Institutional investors utilize the married put strategy to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) large positions against unexpected downturns. This allows them to manage portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively while still retaining the potential for returns.

### Retail Investors
Retail investors can use married puts to safeguard individual stock positions, especially in volatile markets or when holding positions through events likely to cause significant price movements (e.g., [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, elections).

By balancing cost and risks, this strategy can be a valuable tool for both institutional and retail investors aiming to safeguard against adverse [market](../m/market.md) movements while still positioning themselves for gains.
