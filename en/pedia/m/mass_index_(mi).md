# Mass Index (MI)

The Mass Index is a volatility based indicator designed to identify potential trend reversals. It focuses on the expansion and contraction of the high low range rather than direction.

## Formula outline
- Compute the high low range for each bar.
- Smooth the range with a 9 period EMA.
- Smooth the result again with another 9 period EMA.
- Compute the ratio of the two EMAs and sum it over 25 periods.

## Interpretation
A common signal is a "bulge" where the Mass Index rises above a threshold (often 27) and then falls below a lower level (often 26.5). The signal suggests a potential reversal, but it does not predict direction.

## Example
The Mass Index rises above 27 and then drops below 26.5. A trader watches for a break of support or resistance to confirm the direction of the reversal.

## Practical notes
The Mass Index works best with trend filters or price action confirmation. It signals a change in volatility structure, not a buy or sell on its own.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Mass Index (MI) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Mass Index (MI) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Mass Index (MI), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Mass Index (MI). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Mass Index (MI) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
