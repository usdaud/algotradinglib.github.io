# Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)

The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) is a self-regulatory organization that was established by Congress in 1975. Its fundamental mission is to protect investors, municipal entities, and the public [interest](../i/interest.md) by promoting a fair and efficient municipal securities [market](../m/market.md). MSRB formulates rules and regulations that govern [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers and municipal advisors in the municipal securities [market](../m/market.md). These rules are enforced by other regulatory bodies, such as the Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC).

## Overview of Municipal Securities

Municipal securities, often referred to as “munis,” are [debt](../d/debt.md) securities issued by states, municipalities, and other governmental entities to [fund](../f/fund.md) public projects like schools, highways, and water systems. These securities can take many forms, including general obligation bonds, [revenue](../r/revenue.md) bonds, and municipal notes. The primary appeal of municipal securities to investors is their tax-exempt status; the [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) received from most [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) is exempt from [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and, in some cases, state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Functions and Responsibilities of the MSRB

The MSRB has several core functions and responsibilities aimed at ensuring the integrity and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the municipal securities [market](../m/market.md). These include:

### Rulemaking

The MSRB creates rules and guidelines aimed at promoting fair and equitable practices within the municipal securities [market](../m/market.md). These rules cover various aspects of the [market](../m/market.md), from [transaction](../t/transaction.md) reporting and [trade](../t/trade.md) data dissemination to conflict-of-[interest](../i/interest.md) guidelines and fiduciary duties for municipal advisors.

### Market Transparency

To enhance [market](../m/market.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md), the MSRB operates the Electronic Municipal [Market](../m/market.md) Access (EMMA) online platform, which provides free public access to official municipal securities disclosures, [trade](../t/trade.md) data, and other critical information. EMMA serves as a centralized platform where investors and other [market](../m/market.md) participants can find comprehensive information about municipal securities.

### Professional Standards

The MSRB establishes and maintains professional standards for municipal advisors and [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers, ensuring that they adhere to ethical practices and maintain a high level of competency. This includes education and continuing professional development to keep [market](../m/market.md) participants aware of the latest regulatory changes and [market](../m/market.md) [best practices](../b/best_practices.md).

### Enforcement and Compliance

While the MSRB has the authority to create rules, it does not have direct enforcement power. Instead, it relies on other regulatory bodies, such as FINRA and the SEC, to enforce its rules. The MSRB works closely with these organizations to ensure that its rules are properly implemented and followed.

### Investor Protection

The MSRB is committed to protecting investors, particularly retail investors, who may be less familiar with the intricacies of municipal securities. This includes providing educational resources and tools to help investors make informed decisions. The MSRB's rules are also designed to ensure that investors receive fair pricing and appropriate disclosures.

## Key Regulatory Rules and Requirements

Among the many rules established by the MSRB, several are particularly important for maintaining [market](../m/market.md) integrity and protecting investors:

### Rule G-17: Conduct of Municipal Securities and Municipal Advisory Activities

This rule mandates that brokers, dealers, and municipal advisors deal fairly with all persons and prohibit deceptive, dishonest, or unfair practices.

### Rule G-20: Gifts and Gratuities

To prevent conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md), this rule restricts the [value](../v/value.md) and types of gifts that municipal securities professionals can give or receive in connection with their [business](../b/business.md).

### Rule G-37: Political Contributions and Prohibitions on Municipal Securities Business

Rule G-37 aims to eliminate "pay-to-play" practices by prohibiting municipal securities dealers from engaging in [business](../b/business.md) with an [issuer](../i/issuer.md) for two years if certain political contributions have been made to officials of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) by the [dealer](../d/dealer.md) or its associated persons.

### Rule G-38: Solicitation of Municipal Securities Business

This rule prohibits dealers from paying any person who is not an affiliated person of the [dealer](../d/dealer.md) to solicit municipal securities [business](../b/business.md) on their behalf.

### Rule G-42: Duties of Non-Solicitor Municipal Advisors

This rule sets forth the core standards of conduct of municipal advisors, including their fiduciary duty to municipal entity clients and the requirement to deal fairly with all persons in the conduct of their municipal advisory activities.

### Rule G-45: Reporting of Information on Municipal Fund Securities

This rule requires underwriters of municipal [fund](../f/fund.md) securities, such as 529 college savings plans, to submit periodic reports to the MSRB, aiding in the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and monitoring of these investment products.

## Educational Initiatives

The MSRB places a significant emphasis on education as a means of promoting a well-informed marketplace. To this end, MSRB offers a [range](../r/range.md) of educational resources for [market](../m/market.md) participants, including:

### MuniEdPro®

MuniEdPro® is an interactive, online learning platform that provides courses on various aspects of the municipal securities [market](../m/market.md). These courses are designed for [market](../m/market.md) participants at all levels, from beginners to seasoned professionals.

### Investor Toolkit

The MSRB provides a comprehensive toolkit for investors that includes guides, alerts, and calculators to help understand the risks and returns associated with municipal securities.

### Webinars and Workshops

The MSRB frequently hosts webinars and workshops to provide updates on regulatory changes, [market](../m/market.md) trends, and educational content. These sessions are designed to enhance the knowledge and competency of [market](../m/market.md) participants.

## The Role of EMMA (Electronic Municipal Market Access)

EMMA is a cornerstone of the MSRB’s efforts to promote [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the municipal securities [market](../m/market.md). It provides a user-friendly interface where investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders can access critical information, including:

- **Official Statements**: Comprehensive documents that provide detailed information about municipal securities offerings.
- **Continuing Disclosures**: Ongoing financial and operational disclosures by municipal issuers.
- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Data**: Real-time and historical [trade](../t/trade.md) prices and yields for municipal securities.
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Ratings**: Ratings assigned to municipal securities by [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies.
- **Educational Resources**: Tools and materials to aid investors in making informed decisions.

## Recent Developments and Future Directions

The landscape of the municipal securities [market](../m/market.md) is continually evolving, and the MSRB is actively engaged in adapting its rules and resources to keep pace with these changes. Some recent and future initiatives include:

### ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Disclosure

As [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) in ESG issues grows, the MSRB is focusing on facilitating better disclosures related to these factors in the municipal [market](../m/market.md). This includes exploring ways to standardize and enhance the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) of ESG-related information.

### Technology and Innovation

The MSRB is leveraging advancements in technology to improve [market](../m/market.md) surveillance and enforcement. This includes using [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) to detect patterns indicative of [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) or other prohibited activities.

### Modernizing the Rule Book

The MSRB is engaging in a comprehensive review of its rules to ensure they remain relevant and effective in the modern [market](../m/market.md) environment. This involves streamlining or updating existing rules and potentially creating new regulatory frameworks to address emerging issues.

## Conclusion

The MSRB plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the municipal securities [market](../m/market.md). Through its rulemaking, educational initiatives, and commitment to [transparency](../t/transparency.md), the MSRB seeks to protect investors and promote a fair and competitive marketplace. As the [market](../m/market.md) continues to evolve, the MSRB remains at the forefront of efforts to adapt its regulations and resources to meet new challenges and opportunities.
