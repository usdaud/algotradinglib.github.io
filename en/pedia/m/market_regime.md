# Market Regime

A market regime is a broad state of market behavior characterized by patterns in trend, volatility, and correlations. Regime analysis helps traders adapt strategies to different conditions.

## Common regimes
- Trending with low volatility.
- Trending with high volatility.
- Range bound or mean reverting.
- Crisis or risk off with elevated correlations.

## Identification methods
- Volatility measures such as ATR or realized volatility.
- Trend measures such as moving average slope.
- Correlation and dispersion metrics across assets.
- Macro or policy indicators.

## Example
A strategy that performs well in a low volatility trend regime may struggle in a choppy, mean reverting regime. Regime labeling can guide position sizing or signal filters.

## Practical notes
Regimes are not sharply defined and can shift quickly. A regime model should be updated regularly and tested across cycles.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Market Regime and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Market Regime as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Market Regime, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Market Regime. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Market Regime alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
