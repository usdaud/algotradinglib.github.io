# Market Manipulation

[Market](../m/market.md) Manipulation refers to deliberate actions taken by an individual or group to artificially influence the price or [market](../m/market.md) behavior of financial instruments, securities, or commodities. These practices are typically illegal and are designed to deceive other investors by creating a false or misleading appearance of [market](../m/market.md) activity. By manipulating markets, perpetrators can [profit](../p/profit.md) at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of other participants. This behavior undermines the integrity of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and can lead to significant financial losses for unsuspecting investors. Here, we explore various forms of [market](../m/market.md) manipulation, their consequences, regulations and enforcement, detection methods, and notable historical cases.

## Types of Market Manipulation

### Pump and Dump Schemes

**Pump and dump** schemes involve artificially inflating the price of a stock (usually a [penny stock](../p/penny_stock.md)) through false or misleading statements. The manipulator then sells their [shares](../s/shares.md) at the elevated price, profiting at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of those who bought in during the "pump" phase. Once the manipulator sells off their [shares](../s/shares.md), the price typically plummets, leaving the later investors with losses.

### Spoofing

**[Spoofing](../s/spoofing.md)** is a tactic used by traders to place orders to buy or sell [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) with the intention of canceling them before they are executed. The purpose is to create a false sense of [supply](../s/supply.md) or [demand](../d/demand.md), influencing prices. This can mislead other [market](../m/market.md) participants into making investment decisions based on the fake orders.

### Quote Stuffing

**[Quote stuffing](../q/quote_stuffing.md)** involves quickly placing and then canceling large numbers of orders to flood the [market](../m/market.md) with excess information. This can slow down [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) and confuse [market](../m/market.md) participants, giving the manipulator an advantage.

### Wash Trading

**[Wash trading](../w/wash_trading.md)** involves buying and selling the same financial instruments at the same time, creating the illusion of greater [market](../m/market.md) activity and influencing prices. These trades are usually executed through various accounts controlled by the same individual or group.

### Front Running

**Front running** occurs when a [broker](../b/broker.md) or [trader](../t/trader.md) receives an [order](../o/order.md) and, knowing that this [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) affect the price, trades on that information before executing the client's [order](../o/order.md). This behavior allows the manipulator to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the impending price movement.

### Bear Raiding

**Bear raiding** involves attempting to push down the price of a stock by spreading false or misleading information about the company. The manipulator profits by short-selling the stock before the price drops due to the disseminated negative information.

## Consequences of Market Manipulation

[Market](../m/market.md) manipulation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only individual investors but the overall functioning of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Some of the key consequences include:

- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Losses**: Manipulated [market](../m/market.md) movements can lead to significant financial losses for investors who base their decisions on misleading information.

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Inefficiencies**: These practices can distort the true [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) mechanism, leading to inefficient resource allocation and reduced [market](../m/market.md) confidence.

- **Legal and Financial Repercussions**: Those caught engaging in [market](../m/market.md) manipulation face severe penalties, including fines, disgorgement of profits, and imprisonment.

- **Reputational Damage**: [Market](../m/market.md) manipulation can tarnish the reputation of exchanges, brokers, and financial institutions, leading to a loss of [trust](../t/trust.md) among [market](../m/market.md) participants.

## Regulatory Framework and Enforcement

Various regulatory bodies globally are tasked with monitoring, detecting, and prosecuting [market](../m/market.md) manipulation activities. Some key regulatory bodies include:

- **United States Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC)**: The SEC enforces securities laws in the United States and takes action against individuals and entities involved in [market](../m/market.md) manipulation.
 -

- **[Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC)**: The CFTC oversees [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) markets in the U.S., ensuring they operate in a transparent and competitive manner.
 -

- **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)**: The FCA regulates [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) in the United Kingdom, aiming to protect consumers and ensure [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

### Statistical Analysis

Statistical techniques, such as Benford's Law and abnormal returns analysis, help identify irregularities in trading volumes, price movements, and [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md).

### Order Book Analysis

Real-time monitoring of the [order book](../o/order_book.md) can reveal suspicious [order](../o/order.md) placements, cancellations, and other manipulative behaviors like [spoofing](../s/spoofing.md) and layering.

### Market Surveillance Systems

Regulators and exchanges use sophisticated surveillance systems that employ [pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) and [predictive analytics](../p/predictive_analytics.md) to detect and prevent manipulative activities.

## Notable Historical Cases of Market Manipulation

### Enron Scandal

Enron [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), an American energy company, was involved in one of the most infamous cases of corporate [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and [market](../m/market.md) manipulation. The company used complex financial structures to hide [debt](../d/debt.md) and inflate profits. This manipulation led to the collapse of Enron in 2001, resulting in significant [investor](../i/investor.md) losses and the dissolution of Arthur Andersen, one of the largest audit firms at the time.

### LIBOR Manipulation

The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) scandal involved several large banks, including Barclays, [UBS](../u/ubs.md), and Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md), manipulating the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for [profit](../p/profit.md). Traders colluded to submit false rates, affecting global financial contracts worth trillions of dollars. The scandal prompted significant changes in how [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates are calculated.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

### Volkswagen Emissions Scandal
