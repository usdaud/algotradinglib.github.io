# Market Manipulation

[Market](../m/market.md) Manipulation refers to deliberate actions taken by an individual or group to artificially influence the price or [market](../m/market.md) behavior of financial instruments, securities, or commodities. These practices are typically illegal and are designed to deceive other investors by creating a false or misleading appearance of [market](../m/market.md) activity. By manipulating markets, perpetrators can [profit](../p/profit.md) at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of other participants. This behavior undermines the integrity of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and can lead to significant financial losses for unsuspecting investors. Here, we explore various forms of [market](../m/market.md) manipulation, their consequences, regulations and enforcement, detection methods, and notable historical cases.

## Types of Market Manipulation

### Pump and Dump Schemes

**Pump and dump** schemes involve artificially inflating the price of a stock (usually a [penny stock](../p/penny_stock.md)) through false or misleading statements. The manipulator then sells their [shares](../s/shares.md) at the elevated price, profiting at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of those who bought in during the "pump" phase. Once the manipulator sells off their [shares](../s/shares.md), the price typically plummets, leaving the later investors with losses.

### Spoofing

**[Spoofing](../s/spoofing.md)** is a tactic used by traders to place orders to buy or sell [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) with the intention of canceling them before they are executed. The purpose is to create a false sense of [supply](../s/supply.md) or [demand](../d/demand.md), influencing prices. This can mislead other [market](../m/market.md) participants into making investment decisions based on the fake orders.

### Quote Stuffing

**[Quote stuffing](../q/quote_stuffing.md)** involves quickly placing and then canceling large numbers of orders to flood the [market](../m/market.md) with excess information. This can slow down [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) and confuse [market](../m/market.md) participants, giving the manipulator an advantage.

### Wash Trading

**[Wash trading](../w/wash_trading.md)** involves buying and selling the same financial instruments at the same time, creating the illusion of greater [market](../m/market.md) activity and influencing prices. These trades are usually executed through various accounts controlled by the same individual or group.

### Front Running

**Front running** occurs when a [broker](../b/broker.md) or [trader](../t/trader.md) receives an [order](../o/order.md) and, knowing that this [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) affect the price, trades on that information before executing the client's [order](../o/order.md). This behavior allows the manipulator to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the impending price movement.

### Bear Raiding

**Bear raiding** involves attempting to push down the price of a stock by spreading false or misleading information about the company. The manipulator profits by short-selling the stock before the price drops due to the disseminated negative information.

## Consequences of Market Manipulation

[Market](../m/market.md) manipulation can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only individual investors but the overall functioning of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Some of the key consequences include:

- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Losses**: Manipulated [market](../m/market.md) movements can lead to significant financial losses for investors who base their decisions on misleading information.

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Inefficiencies**: These practices can distort the true [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) mechanism, leading to inefficient resource allocation and reduced [market](../m/market.md) confidence.

- **Legal and Financial Repercussions**: Those caught engaging in [market](../m/market.md) manipulation face severe penalties, including fines, disgorgement of profits, and imprisonment.

- **Reputational Damage**: [Market](../m/market.md) manipulation can tarnish the reputation of exchanges, brokers, and financial institutions, leading to a loss of [trust](../t/trust.md) among [market](../m/market.md) participants.

## Regulatory Framework and Enforcement

Various regulatory bodies globally are tasked with monitoring, detecting, and prosecuting [market](../m/market.md) manipulation activities. Some key regulatory bodies include:
