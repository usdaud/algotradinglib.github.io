# Model Distillation & Quantization

Model Distillation and Quantization are techniques used to reduce the size and complexity of [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) models while retaining most of their performance.

### Key Components
- **Knowledge Distillation:** A smaller “student” model learns to mimic a larger “teacher” model’s behavior.
- **Quantization:** Reducing the numerical precision of model parameters (e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit) to decrease memory usage and increase speed.
- **Pruning:** Removing redundant neurons or connections to create a more compact model.
- **Compression Pipelines:** Combining distillation, quantization, and pruning to optimize models for deployment.

### Applications
- **Edge Devices:** Running models on smartphones, IoT devices, and embedded systems.
- **Cloud Services:** Lowering inference costs in large-scale applications.
- **Real-Time Systems:** Accelerating model inference for time-sensitive tasks.
- **Model Deployment:** Facilitating faster updates and easier integration in production environments.

### Advantages
- Significant reduction in model size and computational requirements.
- Faster inference speed and lower energy consumption.
- Enables deployment on resource-constrained devices.

### Challenges
- Potential loss of accuracy if distillation or quantization is too aggressive.
- Balancing compression with performance preservation.
- Complexity in designing optimal compression pipelines.

### Future Outlook
Ongoing research aims to refine these techniques to minimize performance degradation, enabling even the most advanced models to run efficiently on limited hardware while maintaining high accuracy.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Model Distillation & Quantization and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Model Distillation & Quantization as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Model Distillation & Quantization, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Model Distillation & Quantization. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Model Distillation & Quantization alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
