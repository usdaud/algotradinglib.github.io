# Monetarism

Monetarism is an economic theory that focuses on the role of governments in controlling the amount of [money](../m/money.md) in circulation. The foundational premise of [monetarist theory](../m/monetarist_theory.md) is that variations in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) have major influences on national output in the [short run](../s/short_run.md) and the [price level](../p/price_level.md) over longer periods.

## Origins and Development

Monetarism gained prominence as a significant economic theory primarily during the late 20th century. The fundamental principles were systematically developed and presented by [Milton Friedman](../m/milton_friedman.md), a renowned American [economist](../e/economist.md), and his colleagues at the University of Chicago. The ideas of monetarism are encapsulated in what became known as the "Chicago School" of economic thought.

Central to [monetarist theory](../m/monetarist_theory.md) is the [Quantity Theory of Money](../q/quantity_theory_of_money.md) (QTM), which posits a direct relationship between the quantity of [money](../m/money.md) in an [economy](../e/economy.md) and the level of prices of goods and services sold. The QTM is succinctly represented by the equation MV = PQ, where:
- M stands for the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md),
- V is the [velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md) (the rate at which [money](../m/money.md) circulates in the [economy](../e/economy.md)),
- P represents the [price level](../p/price_level.md), and
- Q denotes the real output.

## Core Principles of Monetarism

### The Control Over Money Supply

Monetarists argue that control over the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) should be the central goal of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). They advocate for a slow and steady increase in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) at a rate consistent with the long-term growth of the [economy](../e/economy.md)'s productive capacity, which they believe [will](../w/will.md) lead to stable [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and low [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### The Role of Inflation

[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) is viewed as always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. According to monetarists, sustained [inflation](../i/inflation.md) occurs only as a result of a growth rate in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) that outstrips the growth rate of real output. Thus, to control [inflation](../i/inflation.md), central banks should restrict the growth of the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).

### The Limited Effectiveness of Fiscal Policy

Monetarists often [hold](../h/hold.md) a critical view of [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md), particularly of expansionary fiscal policies such as increased government spending or tax cuts aimed at stimulating [demand](../d/demand.md). They argue that such policies are often time-inconsistent, can lead to excessive accumulation of public [debt](../d/debt.md), and are less effective compared to [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tools.

### Natural Rate of Unemployment

Another key concept in monetarism is the natural rate of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), which is the rate of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) consistent with a stable rate of [inflation](../i/inflation.md). This rate reflects structural factors in the [economy](../e/economy.md) such as [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) frictions and skills mismatches, rather than fluctuations in [demand](../d/demand.md). Monetarists argue that attempts to reduce [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) below this natural rate through monetary and fiscal measures [will](../w/will.md) only lead to accelerating [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Rational Expectations

[Rational expectations theory](../r/rational_expectations_theory.md), closely associated with monetarist thought, posits that individuals and firms make decisions based on all available information and their understanding of economic policy. This implies that predictable policy interventions, such as systematic changes to the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), [will](../w/will.md) be anticipated by economic agents and thus neutralized in their effects.

## Practical Implications and Policy Recommendations

Monetarists advocate for a set of policy recommendations designed to ensure consistent control over the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and economic stability. These recommendations include:

### Money Supply Rules

Adopting a [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) rule, such as Friedman’s constant monetary growth rule, which suggests that the central [bank](../b/bank.md) should target a constant, low growth rate for the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) aligned with the long-term growth rate of real GDP.

### Monetary Targets

Setting clear monetary targets rather than focusing on short-term stabilization policies. By committing to a transparent and predictable [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), central banks can anchor [inflation](../i/inflation.md) expectations and stabilize the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Central Bank Independence

Ensuring the independence of central banks from political influence. This independence is crucial for maintaining a credible commitment to controlling [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and avoiding the temptation to engage in politically motivated monetary [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

### Inflation Targeting

While this diverges slightly from pure monetarism, some monetarists support [inflation](../i/inflation.md) targeting as a practical means of achieving price stability. [Inflation](../i/inflation.md)-targeting central banks aim to keep [inflation](../i/inflation.md) within a specified band, indirectly controlling [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) growth.

### Criticisms of Monetarism

Although monetarism has significantly influenced economic thought and policy, it has also faced considerable criticism. Key points of contention include:

### Over-simplification

Critics argue that monetarism’s focus on a single variable—the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md)—is overly simplistic. The complexity of the [economy](../e/economy.md) means that [multiple](../m/multiple.md) factors, including [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md), global [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), and financial [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md), also significantly influence economic outcomes.

### Velocity of Money

The assumption that the [velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md) is stable or predictable is often challenged. In practice, the [velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md) can fluctuate due to changing preferences for [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), advancements in [payment](../p/payment.md) technologies, and other factors, complicating the relationship between [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and economic output.

### Shortage of Empirical Evidence

There are debates over the empirical validity of monetarist predictions. Real-world evidence sometimes shows a weaker relationship between [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) growth and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) than monetarists claim.

### Policy Implementation Challenges

The practical implementation of a strict [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) rule can be difficult. Measuring the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) accurately and controlling its growth rate in a precisely calibrated manner is a complex task that central banks may find challenging.

## Influence on Economic Policy

Despite the criticisms, monetarism has left an indelible mark on economic policy, particularly from the 1970s onwards. Notable historical examples include:

### Paul Volcker’s Fed

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, under the chairmanship of Paul Volcker, the U.S. Federal Reserve adopted monetarist principles to combat high [inflation](../i/inflation.md). By sharply restricting the growth of the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), the Fed successfully brought down [inflation](../i/inflation.md), albeit at the cost of a short-term spike in [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

### Thatcher’s UK Policies

In the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher’s government implemented monetarist policies in the early 1980s, focusing on controlling [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) growth to curb [inflation](../i/inflation.md). These policies were accompanied by significant economic [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) and [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md).

### Ongoing Influence

Elements of monetarist thought continue to influence contemporary [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) frameworks, including the emphasis on central [bank](../b/bank.md) independence and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) targeting regimes adopted by several central banks around the world.

## Monetarism in the Modern Context

As the global [economy](../e/economy.md) evolves, the relevance and applicability of monetarist ideas remain a topic of debate. Modern central banks often incorporate a broad [range](../r/range.md) of [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) and adopt flexible [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-targeting frameworks rather than rigid adherence to [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) targets. Additionally, developments in financial technology and changes in the global economic landscape constantly pose new challenges and considerations for the implementation of monetarist principles.
