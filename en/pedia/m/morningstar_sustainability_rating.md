# Morningstar Sustainability Rating

The [Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) Sustainability [Rating](../r/rating.md), sometimes referred to as the "Globe [Rating](../r/rating.md)" due to the globes used in its scoring system, is a metric that evaluates the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) sustainability of mutual funds and [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs). This [rating](../r/rating.md) system provides investors with a way to compare funds based on their ESG practices and impact, ultimately helping them make more informed decisions that align with their values.

## Overview

[Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md), Inc., a leading provider of independent investment research, introduced the Sustainability [Rating](../r/rating.md) in 2016. The [rating](../r/rating.md) aims to equip investors with insights into how effectively the companies within a [fund](../f/fund.md) are managing their ESG risks relative to their peers. Given the growing [interest](../i/interest.md) in sustainable [investing](../i/investing.md), this tool has become a valuable resource for assessing [fund](../f/fund.md) performance from an ESG perspective.

## How the Rating is Calculated

The [Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) Sustainability [Rating](../r/rating.md) is determined based on two primary factors: the ESG [risk](../r/risk.md) ratings of the companies within a [fund](../f/fund.md) and the level of controversy associated with those companies.

### ESG Risk Ratings

[Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) relies on data from Sustainalytics, a leading provider of ESG ratings and research. Sustainalytics assesses companies across various ESG dimensions, including:

- **Environmental Factors**: This includes carbon emissions, natural resource usage, waste management, and the company’s overall impact on the environment.
- **Social Factors**: This looks at how companies manage relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and communities. It includes human rights, labor standards, and community relations.
- **Governance Factors**: This evaluates the quality of a company’s management, board composition, ethics, and corporate sustainability initiatives.

### Controversy Score

Sustainalytics also provides a controversy score, which reflects incidents that may have a negative impact on stakeholders, such as environmental spills, lawsuits, or company scandals. The score ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating low controversy and 5 indicating severe controversy.

### Fund Scoring Process

1. **Company-Level Assessment**: Each company within a [fund](../f/fund.md) is assessed for ESG risks and controversies. These scores are [weighted](../w/weighted.md) based on the company's size ([market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)) and its percentage of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [holdings](../h/holdings.md).
2. **[Fund](../f/fund.md)-Level [Aggregation](../a/aggregation.md)**: The individual company scores are aggregated to provide an overall ESG [risk](../r/risk.md) score for the [fund](../f/fund.md).
3. **Relative Ranking**: Funds are then ranked relative to other funds within the same [Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) Global Category, which groups funds with similar investment objectives.

The final [rating](../r/rating.md) is expressed as a number of globes, ranging from 1 to 5:
- 1 Globe: Lowest sustainability percentile
- 2 Globes: Below-average sustainability percentile
- 3 Globes: Average sustainability percentile
- 4 Globes: Above-average sustainability percentile
- 5 Globes: Highest sustainability percentile

## Benefits for Investors

### Informed Decision-Making

Investors can use the [Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) Sustainability [Rating](../r/rating.md) to assess the alignment of their investments with personal values and goals related to sustainability. By comparing the sustainability performance of different funds, investors can select those that better manage ESG risks and contribute to positive societal impact.

### Risk Management

Funds with higher sustainability ratings often demonstrate better management of material ESG risks, which can translate to lower operational risks and potential for long-term outperformance. This makes the [rating](../r/rating.md) a useful tool for [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors looking to mitigate exposure to ESG-related issues.

### Enhanced Transparency

The [rating](../r/rating.md) system promotes [transparency](../t/transparency.md) by providing a standardized method for evaluating the ESG performance of funds. It encourages [fund](../f/fund.md) managers to articulate and improve their ESG practices, thus fostering a more sustainable investment landscape.

## Challenges and Criticisms

Despite its benefits, the [Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) Sustainability [Rating](../r/rating.md) system faces several criticisms:

### Data Reliability

The [rating](../r/rating.md) relies heavily on data from Sustainalytics, which may face challenges such as data [gaps](../g/gap.md), inconsistencies, or misreported information from companies. The accuracy of the [rating](../r/rating.md) is dependent on the quality and completeness of these data inputs.

### Subjectivity in ESG Factors

ESG factors can be inherently subjective, and the importance of various factors may differ among investors. While the [rating](../r/rating.md) system provides a comprehensive view of ESG risks, it may not account for specific nuances or priorities held by individual investors.

### Evolving Standards

ESG standards and metrics are continually evolving, which can make it challenging for [rating](../r/rating.md) systems to stay up-to-date and relevant. What is considered a best practice today might change in the future, requiring ongoing adjustments to the [rating](../r/rating.md) methodology.

## Future Developments

[Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) continues to refine and enhance its Sustainability [Rating](../r/rating.md) methodology to address these challenges. Future developments may include:

### Integration of New Data Sources

[Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) is exploring the [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) of additional data sources to improve the accuracy and breadth of ESG assessments. This may include more real-time data feeds, [alternative data](../a/alternative_data.md) sources, and enhanced controversy monitoring.

### Enhanced Customization

There is potential for more personalized sustainability assessments that allow investors to tailor the ratings to their specific ESG priorities. This could involve customizable weightings for different ESG factors or more granular analysis of specific issues.

### Collaborative Efforts

As the ESG landscape evolves, [Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) collaborates with other [industry](../i/industry.md) stakeholders, including regulatory bodies, financial institutions, and ESG research organizations, to refine [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) and ensure the ratings remain relevant and impactful.

## Conclusion

The [Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) Sustainability [Rating](../r/rating.md) provides a valuable framework for evaluating the ESG performance of mutual funds and ETFs. By using this tool, investors can make more informed decisions that align with their sustainability values, manage risks associated with ESG factors, and contribute to the broader goal of fostering sustainable development in the investment landscape.
