# Mathematical Models

---

Mathematical models play a crucial role in the realm of trading, especially within the [scope](../s/scope.md) of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (also known as algo-trading or automated trading). By utilizing advanced mathematical concepts and techniques, traders can develop algorithms that help predict [market](../m/market.md) movements, manage risks, and optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Here, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into various mathematical models and methods that are commonly used in trading.

#### 1. Time Series Analysis

[Time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md) involves the study of data points collected or sequenced over time to identify inherent patterns or trends. It is instrumental in understanding the historical price movements of financial instruments and predicting future prices.

##### Key Methods:
- **Autoregressive (AR) Model**: This model assumes that the future [value](../v/value.md) of a variable is a linear function of its past values.

- **[Reinforcement Learning](../r/reinforcement_learning.md)**: Algorithms learn optimal [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) by receiving feedback from their actions in a [market](../m/market.md) environment.

#### 6. Portfolio Optimization

[Portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md) involves selecting the best combination of assets to maximize [return](../r/return.md) for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md). Mathematical models play a crucial role in this process.

##### Key Models:
- **Markowitz Model**: Also known as the [Mean-Variance Optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md), it helps in forming an [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md) of optimal portfolios.
- **[Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM)**: Used to determine the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) based on its [risk](../r/risk.md) relative to the [market](../m/market.md).
