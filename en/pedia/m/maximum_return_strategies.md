# Maximum Return Strategies

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as algo-trading or automated trading, involves the use of computer algorithms to execute [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) at speeds and frequencies that are impossible for human traders. One of the primary goals of these algorithms is to achieve the maximum possible [return](../r/return.md) on investment (ROI). Maximum [return](../r/return.md) strategies are designed to optimize the [profit](../p/profit.md) potentials while mitigating risks as much as possible.

#### Types of Maximum Return Strategies

1. **[Momentum Trading](../m/momentum_trading.md) Strategies**:
    [Momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md) is a strategy that aims to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the continuance of existing trends in the [market](../m/market.md). This can be done using algorithms that detect the beginning of a strong [trend](../t/trend.md) and then [trade](../t/trade.md) in the direction of that [trend](../t/trend.md). Key indicators used in [momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md) include the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI), Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD), and various other [momentum oscillators](../m/momentum_oscillators.md).

    **Example Algorithm**:
    ```python
    def momentum_strategy(prices):
        short_window = 40
        long_window = 100

        signals = pd.DataFrame([index](../i/index_instrument.md)=prices.[index](../i/index_instrument.md))
        signals['signal'] = 0.0

        signals['short_mavg'] = prices['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
        signals['long_mavg'] = prices['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

        signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                    > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
        signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

        [return](../r/return.md) signals
    ```
   
2. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) Strategies**:
    [Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies operate on the assumption that [asset](../a/asset.md) prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical mean over time. These strategies often use statistical methods to determine when an [asset](../a/asset.md) has deviated significantly from its historical average and then place trades to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on its [return](../r/return.md) to the mean.

    **Example Algorithm**:
    ```python
    def mean_reversion_strategy(prices, window=15):
        moving_avg = prices.rolling(window=window).mean()
        moving_std = prices.rolling(window=window).std()

        z_score = (prices - moving_avg) / moving_std

        signals = pd.DataFrame([index](../i/index_instrument.md)=prices.[index](../i/index_instrument.md))
        signals['signal'] = -z_score

        [return](../r/return.md) signals
    ```

3. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) Strategies**:
    [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves simultaneously buying and selling an [asset](../a/asset.md) in different markets to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the price differential. In the context of maximum [return](../r/return.md) strategies, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) can be incredibly [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) as long as the algorithm is capable of detecting and acting on price discrepancies faster than the [market](../m/market.md) can correct them.

    **Example Algorithm**:
    ```python
    def arbitrage_strategy(exchange1_prices, exchange2_prices):
        spread = exchange1_prices - exchange2_prices
        z_score = (spread - spread.mean()) / spread.std()

        signals = pd.DataFrame([index](../i/index_instrument.md)=exchange1_prices.[index](../i/index_instrument.md))
        signals['signal'] = np.where(z_score > 1, 1, np.where(z_score < -1, -1, 0))

        signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

        [return](../r/return.md) signals
    ```

4. **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md)-based Strategies**:
    [Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) (ML) allows for more complex strategies that can adapt and evolve with changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions. These strategies can include [supervised learning](../s/supervised_learning.md) techniques to forecast prices or classify [market](../m/market.md) conditions, as well as [reinforcement learning](../r/reinforcement_learning.md) for optimizing trading decisions over time.

    **Example Algorithm**: Using a [supervised learning](../s/supervised_learning.md) model to forecast stock prices.
    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble [import](../i/import.md) RandomForestRegressor

    def ml_strategy(prices, window=5):
        data = prices[['Close']]
        data['returns'] = data['Close'].pct_change()
        # Create lagged features
        for i in [range](../r/range.md)(1, window + 1):
            data[f'lag_{i}'] = data['returns'].shift(i)

        data.dropna(inplace=True)

        X = data[[f'lag_{i}' for i in [range](../r/range.md)(1, window + 1)]]
        y = data['returns']

        model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
        model.fit(X, y)

        predictions = model.predict(X)
        signals = pd.DataFrame([index](../i/index_instrument.md)=prices.[index](../i/index_instrument.md))
        signals['signal'] = np.where(predictions > 0, 1, -1)

        [return](../r/return.md) signals
    ```

5. **High-Frequency [Trading Strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md)**:
    High-Frequency Trading (HFT) involves executing a large number of orders at extremely quick speeds. The strategy aims to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on tiny price discrepancies and execute orders based on minimal data processing time. These strategies are often implemented using complex algorithms and require substantial computational power.

    **Example Algorithm**:
    ```python
    def high_frequency_strategy(market_data):
        buy_threshold = -1
        sell_threshold = 1

        signals = pd.DataFrame([index](../i/index_instrument.md)=market_data.[index](../i/index_instrument.md))
        signals['signal'] = np.where(market_data['price_change'] <= buy_threshold, 1, np.where(market_data['price_change'] >= sell_threshold, -1, 0))

        [return](../r/return.md) signals
    ```

#### Risk Management in Maximum Return Strategies

Incorporating [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) measures is crucial to ensure that achieving maximum returns does not come at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of excessive [risk](../r/risk.md). Here are some commonly used [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques:

1. **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**:
    [Stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) automatically sell a position when it reaches a predetermined price, thereby limiting potential losses. 

    **Example**:
    ```python
    def apply_stop_loss(signal, prices, stop_loss_percentage):
        stop_loss = prices * (1 - stop_loss_percentage)

        signals = signal.copy()
        signals['stop_loss_triggered'] = prices <= stop_loss
        signals['final_signal'] = np.where(signals['stop_loss_triggered'], 0, signals['signal'])

        [return](../r/return.md) signals
    ```

2. **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**:
    Determining the size of each [trade](../t/trade.md) relative to the total portfolio [value](../v/value.md) can greatly affect overall [risk](../r/risk.md). Various techniques like the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) or fixed fractional [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) can be employed.

    **Example**:
    ```python
    def position_sizing(signal, portfolio_value, risk_per_trade):
        signals = signal.copy()
        signals['position_size'] = portfolio_value * risk_per_trade

        [return](../r/return.md) signals
    ```

3. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**:
    Diversifying trades across different assets, markets, or strategies can help mitigate risks.

    **Example**:
    ```python
    def diversify_portfolio(signals_list):
        diversified_signals = pd.concat(signals_list, axis=1)
        diversified_signals['average_signal'] = diversified_signals.mean(axis=1)

        [return](../r/return.md) diversified_signals
    ```

#### Practical Considerations

- **Data Quality**: The quality of data used for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and live trading is crucial. Poor quality data can lead to inaccurate backtests and suboptimal [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md).
- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Thorough [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) over various [market](../m/market.md) conditions helps ensure that a strategy is [robust](../r/robust.md). Adjustments to the strategy should be made based on [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) results.
- **[Slippage](../s/slippage.md) and [Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: Real-world trading includes costs like [slippage](../s/slippage.md) and commissions, which can significantly affect the profitability of a strategy. These should be factored into the strategy development and testing phases.
