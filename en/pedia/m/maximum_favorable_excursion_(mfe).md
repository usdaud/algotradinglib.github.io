# Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE)

Maximum favorable excursion is the largest unrealized gain a trade reaches before it is closed. It measures the best possible profit that was available during the life of the trade.

## Why it matters
MFE helps evaluate exit tactics and profit targets. If typical MFE is much larger than realized gains, the exit method may be too conservative.

## Example
A short trade is opened at 50. The price drops to 42 before rebounding and the trade is closed at 45. The MFE is 8 points.

## Practical use
- Compare MFE to actual profit to assess exit efficiency.
- Identify whether trailing stops capture a reasonable share of available gains.
- Adjust targets based on typical MFE distributions.

## Cautions
High MFE values can occur during volatile spikes that are hard to capture. Execution and liquidity still limit realized profits.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
