## Methodology and Index Calculation

FTSE indices are calculated using transparent, rules-based methodologies that ensure consistency, accuracy, and objectivity. Key components of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) calculation process include:

### Market Capitalization Weighting

Most FTSE indices are [market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md), meaning constituent [stocks](../s/stock.md) are [weighted](../w/weighted.md) according to their [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md). This approach reflects the relative size and importance of each company within the [index](../i/index_instrument.md), providing a realistic measure of [market](../m/market.md) performance.

### Free Float Adjustments

To ensure indices accurately represent investable opportunities, FTSE applies free [float](../f/float.md) adjustments to account for [shares](../s/shares.md) that are not readily available for trading. This adjustment excludes [shares](../s/shares.md) held by insiders, governments, or strategic investors, focusing on [shares](../s/shares.md) available to public investors.

### Regular Reviews and Rebalancing

FTSE indices undergo regular reviews and [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) to maintain accuracy and relevance. Quarterly and annual reviews assess constituent eligibility, reweight [stocks](../s/stock.md) based on [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) changes, and ensure compliance with [index](../i/index_instrument.md) rules. This process ensures that indices remain an accurate reflection of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [market](../m/market.md).

### ESG Integration and Screening

For ESG-focused indices like the FTSE4Good Series, FTSE incorporates rigorous ESG screening criteria to select and weight constituent companies. This involves assessing companies against comprehensive ESG [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), excluding those involved in controversial activities, and rewarding those with strong sustainability practices.

## Impact and Influence on the Financial Market

FTSE indices are widely used by investors, [asset](../a/asset.md) managers, and financial institutions to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) performance, construct portfolios, and develop investment strategies. The adoption of FTSE indices has significant implications for the financial [market](../m/market.md):

### Benchmarking and Performance Measurement

Investors use FTSE indices as benchmarks to measure the performance of their portfolios against a representative [market](../m/market.md) standard. Indices like the FTSE 100 or FTSE All-World provide a reference point for assessing investment returns, making it easier to evaluate [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) performance and make informed investment decisions.

### Passive Investing and Index Funds

The rise of [passive investing](../p/passive_investing.md) has been fueled by the availability of FTSE indices, which serve as the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) benchmarks for [index](../i/index_instrument.md) funds and [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs). These investment vehicles track the performance of FTSE indices, [offering](../o/offering.md) investors low-cost, diversified exposure to various markets and sectors.

### Development of Financial Products

FTSE indices underpin a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial products, including ETFs, mutual funds, and structured products. By providing transparent, rules-based benchmarks, FTSE enables the creation of innovative investment products that cater to different [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md) and investment objectives.

### Socially Responsible Investing (SRI)

FTSE’s ESG-focused indices, such as the FTSE4Good Series, support the growth of socially responsible [investing](../i/investing.md) by identifying companies with strong ESG performance. Investors can align their portfolios with sustainability goals, contributing to a more responsible and ethical financial [market](../m/market.md).

### Risk Management and Asset Allocation

FTSE’s comprehensive suite of indices allows investors to manage risks and allocate assets more effectively.
