# Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

The Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FDIC) is a United States government agency created in 1933 to maintain public confidence and encourage stability in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) through the promotion of sound banking practices. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the FDIC, its history, functions, and impact.

## History and Establishment

The FDIC was established in response to the thousands of [bank](../b/bank.md) failures that occurred in the 1920s and early 1930s. The most noteworthy catalyst for its creation was the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md), during which many depositors lost their savings due to widespread [bank](../b/bank.md) collapses.

The Banking Act of 1933, commonly known as the [Glass-Steagall Act](../g/glass-steagall_act.md), established the FDIC as a temporary government [corporation](../c/corporation.md). A year later, the Banking Act of 1935 made the FDIC a permanent agency of the federal government. The primary objective was to restore [trust](../t/trust.md) in the American banking system by insuring deposits made by individuals in banks and thrifts, thereby mitigating the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [bank](../b/bank.md) runs.

## Functions of the FDIC

### 1. Deposit Insurance

The FDIC insures deposits at member banks and savings institutions up to the legal limit, which is $250,000 per depositor, per insured [bank](../b/bank.md), for each account ownership category. This [insurance](../i/insurance.md) prevents depositors from losing their [money](../m/money.md) if their [bank](../b/bank.md) fails, thus maintaining confidence in the banking system.

#### Coverage Details:
- **Single Accounts:** Insured up to $250,000 per owner.
- **[Joint](../j/joint.md) Accounts:** Each co-owner insured up to $250,000.
- **Retirement Accounts (IRAs, etc.):** Insured separately up to $250,000.
- **[Trust](../t/trust.md) Accounts:** Insured up to $250,000 per [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md).
- **[Business](../b/business.md) Accounts:** Same limits as individual accounts.

### 2. Supervision and Regulation

The FDIC supervises and examines over 4,000 banks and savings institutions for operational safety and soundness. It has the authority to extend and enforce regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Act. The FDIC's regulatory role is critical in overseeing the practices of financial institutions and ensuring compliance with federal laws.

### 3. Resolution of Failed Banks

When an insured [bank](../b/bank.md) fails, the FDIC steps in to protect depositors. The [corporation](../c/corporation.md) either sells the failed [bank](../b/bank.md) to another financial institution or pays depositors directly. Either way, insured deposits are protected up to the specified limits.

The resolution process involves:
- **Purchase and Assumption (P&A):** Another [bank](../b/bank.md) purchases the assets of the failed [bank](../b/bank.md) and assumes responsibility for its liabilities, including deposits.
- **[Deposit](../d/deposit.md) Payoffs:** If no buyer can be found, the FDIC pays out insured deposits directly to the depositors.

### 4. Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is another critical function. The FDIC monitors financial institutions' conditions and practices through extensive on-site examinations and off-site [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md). By assessing [risk](../r/risk.md), the FDIC can take proactive measures to address potential problems before they result in significant issues.

### 5. Consumer Protection and Education

The FDIC promotes consumer rights and ensures that banks adhere to consumer protection laws. This includes regulations related to fair lending, truth in savings, and electronic [fund](../f/fund.md) transfers. The FDIC provides valuable resources to educate consumers about their rights and the safety of their deposits.

## Key Programs and Initiatives

### 1. Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP)

Introduced during the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), the TLGP was designed to strengthen confidence and encourage [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). The program included two main components:
- **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Guarantee Program (DGP):** Offered a guarantee on newly issued senior [unsecured debt](../u/unsecured_debt.md) of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies.
- **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Account Guarantee (TAG) Program:** Provided unlimited guarantees on non-[interest](../i/interest.md)-bearing [transaction](../t/transaction.md) accounts.

### 2. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

Although the Dodd-Frank Act is mainly associated with broader financial reforms, it also ushered in significant changes relevant to the FDIC. The act permanently increased the maximum [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage to $250,000 from $100,000 per depositor, among other provisions designed to enhance financial stability and consumer protection.

## Organizational Structure

The FDIC is managed by a five-member Board of Directors. By law, no more than three board members may be from the same political party, ensuring a degree of bipartisanship in its governance.

- **Chairman:** Appointed by the President of the United States, serving a five-year term.
- **Vice Chairman and Directors:** Also appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation.
- **Comptroller of the [Currency](../c/currency.md):** Serves as an ex officio member of the board.
- **Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** Serves as an ex officio board member.

## Major Milestones

### The 1980s Savings and Loan Crisis

During the 1980s, the FDIC faced significant challenges due to the Savings and [Loan](../l/loan.md) Crisis. This crisis arose from [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md), risky lending practices, and high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates, leading to the failure of many savings institutions. The FDIC played a crucial role in managing the fallout, including the creation of the Resolution [Trust](../t/trust.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (RTC) to manage the assets of failed institutions.

### The 2008 Financial Crisis

The 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) was another significant challenge for the FDIC. The collapse of major financial institutions led to renewed fears of [bank](../b/bank.md) failures. The FDIC’s swift response through the Temporary [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Guarantee Program helped stabilize the banking system. Additionally, the crisis led to significant reforms, including the establishment of the Dodd-Frank Act.

### Modern Day Developments

The FDIC continues to adapt to modern banking challenges, including technological advancements, cybersecurity threats, and evolving financial products. It remains focused on ensuring the stability and [trust](../t/trust.md) of the United States banking system.

## Impact and Importance

### Financial Stability

The FDIC has been instrumental in maintaining financial stability in the U.S. banking system. By insuring deposits and ensuring sound banking practices, it has largely prevented the occurrence of [bank](../b/bank.md) runs since its inception.

### Strengthening Public Confidence

One of the FDIC's most significant achievements is strengthening public confidence in the banking system. By securing deposits and ensuring that banks operate safely and soundly, the FDIC helps maintain a reliable [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

### Support for Community Banks

The FDIC plays a vital role in supporting community banks, which are crucial for local economies. By providing guidelines, resources, and supervisory oversight, the FDIC helps these banks serve their communities effectively.

## Conclusion

The Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FDIC) has been a cornerstone of the American [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) since its creation in 1933. Its mission to protect depositor funds, supervise financial institutions, manage risks, and educate consumers has been critical in maintaining public confidence and stability in the banking system. Throughout its history, the FDIC has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in the face of financial challenges, from the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) to the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). As the financial landscape continues to evolve, the FDIC's role remains as crucial as ever in ensuring a stable and trustworthy banking environment.
