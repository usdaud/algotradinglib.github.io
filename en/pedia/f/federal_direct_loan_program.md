# Federal Direct Loan Program

The Federal Direct [Loan](../l/loan.md) Program (FDLP), also known simply as Direct Loans, is a U.S. Department of Education program that provides low-[interest](../i/interest.md) loans to students and parents to help pay for the cost of a student's education after high school. This comprehensive guide [will](../w/will.md) delve into the specifics of the program, its types of loans, eligibility criteria, [repayment](../r/repayment.md) [options](../o/options.md), benefits, and criticisms.

## Overview

Established under the Higher Education Act of 1965, the Federal Direct [Loan](../l/loan.md) Program was created to simplify the process of borrowing for students and parents, ensuring easier access to federal financial aid. The program directly lends [money](../m/money.md) to students and parents from the U.S. Department of Education, removing the need for private lenders, thereby aiming for greater control over the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) of loans.

## Types of Loans

### Direct Subsidized Loans

Direct Subsidized Loans are offered to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The U.S. Department of Education pays the [interest](../i/interest.md) on these loans while the student is in school at least half-time, during the grace period, and during deferment periods.

### Direct Unsubsidized Loans

Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students and are not based on financial need. [Interest](../i/interest.md) accrues on these loans during all periods, and students are responsible for paying the [interest](../i/interest.md) even while in school.

### Direct PLUS Loans

Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate or professional students and parents of dependent undergraduate students to help pay for education expenses not covered by other financial aid. Borrowers must not have an adverse [credit](../c/credit.md) history. The [maximum loan amount](../m/maximum_loan_amount.md) is the cost of attendance minus any other financial aid received.

### Direct Consolidation Loans

Direct [Consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) Loans allow borrowers to combine all eligible federal student loans into a single [loan](../l/loan.md) with a single [loan](../l/loan.md) servicer. The result is a simplified [repayment](../r/repayment.md) process, but it may also extend the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) period, possibly resulting in more [interest](../i/interest.md) paid over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

## Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for Federal Direct Loans, applicants must meet the following criteria:

1. **Enrollment Status**: Must be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible program at a participating school.
2. **Satisfactory Academic Progress**: Must maintain satisfactory academic progress in your course of study.
3. **U.S. Citizenship or Eligible Non-Citizen**: Must be a U.S. citizen, national, or eligible non-citizen.
4. **Valid [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Number**: Must have a valid [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) number.
5. **Selective Service Registration**: Males aged 18-25 must be registered with Selective Service.
6. **No Defaults or Overpayments**: Borrowers must not be in [default](../d/default.md) on a federal student [loan](../l/loan.md) or owe [money](../m/money.md) on a federal student [grant](../g/grant.md).

## Application Process

The application process involves completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The information provided in the FAFSA is used to calculate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and determine eligibility for federal student aid, including Direct Loans.

1. **FAFSA Form**: Complete the FASFA form online at FAFSA.ed.gov using your Federal Student Aid ID.
2. **Student Aid Report (SAR)**: Review the SAR, which summarizes the information provided on the FAFSA and confirms eligibility for aid.
3. **Award Letter**: College financial aid offices [will](../w/will.md) send award letters detailing the types and amounts of aid available.
4. **Master [Promissory Note](../p/promissory_note.md) (MPN)**: Sign a Master [Promissory Note](../p/promissory_note.md) agreeing to the [loan](../l/loan.md)'s terms.
5. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Entrance Counseling**: First-time borrowers must complete entrance counseling to ensure understanding of the responsibilities and [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Repayment Plans

The FDLP offers various [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plans designed to meet the needs of different borrowers. [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) plans include:

### Standard Repayment Plan

Borrowers pay a fixed monthly amount for up to 10 years. This plan generally results in the lowest total [interest](../i/interest.md) paid over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Graduated Repayment Plan

Payments start low and increase every two years. The [loan](../l/loan.md) must be repaid within 10 years. This plan may be beneficial if borrowers expect their [income](../i/income.md) to increase over time.

### Extended Repayment Plan

Borrowers can extend the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) term up to 25 years. Payments may be fixed or graduated. This plan reduces monthly payments but increases the total [interest](../i/interest.md) paid.

### Income-Driven Repayment Plans

Several [income](../i/income.md)-driven [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plans calculate monthly payments based on [income](../i/income.md) and family size. These plans include:

1. **[Income](../i/income.md)-Based [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) (IBR)**
2. **Pay As You Earn [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) (PAYE)**
3. **Revised Pay As You Earn [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) (REPAYE)**
4. **[Income](../i/income.md)-Contingent [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) (ICR)**

[Income](../i/income.md)-driven plans typically extend the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) period up to 20 or 25 years, after which any remaining [loan](../l/loan.md) balance may be forgiven.

## Benefits of FDLP

The FDLP offers several advantages over private loans, including:

1. **Lower and Fixed [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) rates are often lower and fixed, providing stability and predictability in monthly payments.
2. **Flexible [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) [Options](../o/options.md)**: A variety of [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plans, including [income](../i/income.md)-driven [options](../o/options.md), allow borrowers to choose a plan that fits their financial situation.
3. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Forgiveness**: Borrowers in certain public service jobs may qualify for [loan](../l/loan.md) forgiveness after making qualifying payments for a specified period.
4. **Deferment and [Forbearance](../f/forbearance.md)**: Borrowers may be eligible for deferment or [forbearance](../f/forbearance.md) during periods of financial hardship, which allows temporary suspension or reduction of payments.

## Criticisms and Challenges

While the FDLP provides crucial financial assistance, it faces several criticisms and challenges:

1. **Rising Student [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Critics argue that easy access to loans may contribute to rising student [debt](../d/debt.md) levels, with many graduates struggling to repay their loans.
2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Accrual**: For unsubsidized loans, [interest](../i/interest.md) accrues during all periods, leading to larger [repayment](../r/repayment.md) amounts.
3. **[Repayment](../r/repayment.md) Challenges**: Despite various [repayment](../r/repayment.md) [options](../o/options.md), some borrowers still find it challenging to keep up with payments, especially those in lower-[income](../i/income.md) jobs.
4. **[Loan Servicing](../l/loan_servicing.md) Issues**: Some borrowers report issues with [loan](../l/loan.md) servicers, including miscommunication and errors in processing payments or applying for [income](../i/income.md)-driven [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plans.

## Conclusion

The Federal Direct [Loan](../l/loan.md) Program plays a vital role in making higher education accessible to millions of students and families. By [offering](../o/offering.md) various types of loans with flexible [repayment](../r/repayment.md) [options](../o/options.md), the program helps to bridge the financial gap and support students in reaching their educational and career goals. However, it also presents challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that borrowers can manage their [debt](../d/debt.md) effectively and achieve long-term financial stability.
