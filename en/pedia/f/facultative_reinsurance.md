# Facultative Reinsurance

Facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) is a type of [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) arrangement where the reinsurer evaluates and underwrites individual risks. This method contrasts markedly with [treaty reinsurance](../t/treaty_reinsurance.md), where a reinsurer agrees to cover a portfolio of risks presented by the insurer. Facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) is typically employed for high-[value](../v/value.md) or unique individual risks that may be excluded from the general treaty.

## Key Concepts

### Individual Risk Evaluation
The primary differentiation in facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) is the individualized assessment of each policy the insurer wants to reinsure. The insurer provides specific information about the [risk](../r/risk.md), and the reinsurer decides whether to accept it or not. This [risk](../r/risk.md) can include property, casualty, or specialty lines such as marine, aviation, etc.

### Selective Acceptance and Rejection
Unlike [treaty reinsurance](../t/treaty_reinsurance.md) where the reinsurer covers an entire category or book of [business](../b/business.md), facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) allows the reinsurer to reject risks that do not meet their criteria. Because each [risk](../r/risk.md) is individually assessed, the reinsurer has the liberty to accept risks they find acceptable and reject those they find unfavorable.

### Tailored Coverage
Facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) offers more tailored coverage [options](../o/options.md) compared to [treaty reinsurance](../t/treaty_reinsurance.md). Since each [risk](../r/risk.md) is separately negotiated, the terms, conditions, premiums, and coverage limits can be meticulously adjusted to fit the particular [risk](../r/risk.md)'s profile. This specificity provides both the insurer and reinsurer with more precise [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Process of Facultative Reinsurance

### Risk Submission
The process begins with the primary insurer identifying a specific [risk](../r/risk.md) that needs [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md). The insurer then submits detailed information about the [risk](../r/risk.md) to potential reinsurers. This data generally includes [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) details, historical loss data, and any other relevant information to aid the reinsurer in their assessment.

### Risk Assessment
Upon receiving the [risk](../r/risk.md) information, the reinsurer conducts its assessment. This evaluation involves analyzing the nature of the [risk](../r/risk.md), historical performance, exposure level, and other pertinent factors. The reinsurer uses [actuarial science](../a/actuarial_science.md), [risk](../r/risk.md) modeling, and [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) principles to determine if the [risk](../r/risk.md) aligns with their [risk](../r/risk.md) appetite and [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) guidelines.

### Negotiation of Terms
If the reinsurer decides to accept the [risk](../r/risk.md), they propose [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) terms to the insurer. These terms include coverage limits, [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) premiums, exclusions, retentions, and any special conditions. An iterative [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) process follows, where both parties aim to reach mutually acceptable terms.

### Agreement and Documentation
Once terms are agreed upon, a facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) agreement is formalized. This document outlines all the specifics of the [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) coverage, finalizes the [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of each party, and serves as a legal contract. The policy becomes effective when both parties sign the agreement.

## Advantages of Facultative Reinsurance

### Flexibility in Coverage
Facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) provides insurers with the flexibility to acquire specific and tailor-made [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) coverage. This is especially beneficial for unique or large risks that may not fit into [treaty reinsurance](../t/treaty_reinsurance.md) provisions.

### Enhanced Risk Management
By transferring high-[value](../v/value.md) or outlier risks to a reinsurer, the primary insurer can better manage its [risk](../r/risk.md) portfolio, stabilize [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) results, and protect its [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). This also facilitates better [capital](../c/capital.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [solvency](../s/solvency.md) management.

### Access to Reinsurer Expertise
Facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) allows the primary insurer to benefit from the reinsurer's specialized knowledge and expertise in [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) complex risks. This can result in better [risk](../r/risk.md) pricing and mitigation strategies.

### Better Control Over Underwriting
The insurer retains more control over the [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) process, as they can choose which risks to cede facultatively. This selective process ensures that only those risks that meet the reinsurer's standards are reinsured, potentially resulting in better alignment of interests between the insurer and reinsurer.

## Disadvantages of Facultative Reinsurance

### Higher Administrative Burden
Facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) involves significant administrative efforts as each [risk](../r/risk.md) must be individually underwritten, negotiated, and documented. This can be time-consuming and resource-intensive compared to [treaty reinsurance](../t/treaty_reinsurance.md).

### Potential for Coverage Gaps
The individualized nature of facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) can lead to coverage [gaps](../g/gap.md) if not managed carefully. Each [risk](../r/risk.md) is separately negotiated, and inconsistencies in terms and conditions can arise, potentially leaving certain exposures without [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) coverage.

### Cost Considerations
Due to the personalized nature and higher administrative requirements, facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) can be more costly on a per-[risk](../r/risk.md) [basis](../b/basis.md). This increased cost is reflected in higher [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) premiums compared to treaty arrangements.

## Use Cases of Facultative Reinsurance

### High-Value Property Risks
Facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) is widely used for high-[value](../v/value.md) property risks such as large commercial buildings, industrial plants, and other valuable assets. Given their substantial monetary [value](../v/value.md), these risks require precise [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) to ensure adequate coverage.

### Specialty Lines (Marine and Aviation)
Specialty lines like marine and aviation cover unique risks that often necessitate facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md). The complex and specialized nature of these risks makes them ideal candidates for individualized [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) agreements.

### Catastrophic Event Coverage
Insurers may seek facultative [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) for risks associated with catastrophic events like earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes. These events carry significant loss potential and require high levels of [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) coverage to protect the insurer's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md).
