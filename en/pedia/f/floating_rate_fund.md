# Floating Rate Fund

A floating rate [fund](../f/fund.md) is a type of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) or [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded [fund](../f/fund.md) (ETF) that invests in financial instruments with variable or floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Unlike fixed-rate funds where the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments remain constant throughout the investment period, floating rate funds benefit from getting [interest](../i/interest.md) payments that adjust periodically in line with prevailing [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. This mechanism makes floating rate funds an attractive option for investors, particularly during periods of rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Introduction to Floating Rate Instruments

The primary assets in a floating rate [fund](../f/fund.md) are typically [floating rate notes](../f/floating_rate_notes.md) (FRNs) and loans. These instruments are generally issued by corporations and financial institutions and include the following characteristics:
- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Adjustment:** The [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on these instruments reset periodically, typically every 30 to 90 days. This reset is usually tied to a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) such as the Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate (SOFR). Note: LIBOR was phased out in June 2023 and has been replaced by SOFR and other alternative reference rates.
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Quality:** Floating rate instruments can [range](../r/range.md) from high [credit](../c/credit.md) quality loans, which pose lower [risk](../r/risk.md), to lower-quality, high-[yield](../y/yield.md) loans, which entail higher [risk](../r/risk.md) but potentially [offer](../o/offer.md) higher returns.
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Generation:** These instruments pay [interest](../i/interest.md) to the [fund](../f/fund.md), generating [income](../i/income.md) that can be distributed to investors.

## Benefits of Investing in Floating Rate Funds

### Protection Against Rising Interest Rates
One of the most significant benefits of floating rate funds is their ability to [offer](../o/offer.md) protection against rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the coupons on the floating rate instruments adjust upwards, resulting in higher [income](../i/income.md) distributions for [fund](../f/fund.md) investors. This feature contrasts starkly with fixed-rate bonds, which can lose [value](../v/value.md) as rates go up.

### Diversification
Floating rate funds can enhance [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md) by providing exposure to sectors and instruments that may not be prevalent in [equity](../e/equity.md) or traditional fixed-[income](../i/income.md) portfolios. The loans and notes in these funds often belong to different sectors such as industrials, [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md), and energy.

### Lower Volatility
Floating rate funds typically exhibit lower price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) compared to other [bond](../b/bond.md) funds because the [periodic interest rate](../p/periodic_interest_rate.md) adjustments help keep the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the securities relatively stable. The shorter [duration](../d/duration.md) of these instruments means they are less sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes.

### High Yields
Higher yields can be another attractive feature, especially for funds comprising lower-rated, high-[yield](../y/yield.md) floating rate loans. While the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) may be higher, the potential for elevated [income](../i/income.md) can attract [yield](../y/yield.md)-seeking investors.

## Potential Risks of Floating Rate Funds

### Credit Risk
The [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) loans and notes significantly impacts the [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of floating rate funds. Lower-rated instruments or high-[yield](../y/yield.md) loans come with a higher [default risk](../d/default_risk.md), which may result in [principal](../p/principal.md) loss.

### Market Liquidity
Floating rate instruments can be less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than other types of bonds because the [market](../m/market.md) for these instruments is smaller and less developed. During periods of [market](../m/market.md) stress, it might be challenging to sell these instruments at desired prices, which can impact the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Interest Rate Spread Risk
While floating rate funds benefit from increasing rates, they are subject to spread [risk](../r/risk.md). The spread is the difference between the instrument's rate and the [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) (e.g., LIBOR or SOFR). If the spread narrows, the [income](../i/income.md) generated by the floating-rate instruments may decrease.

## Types of Floating Rate Funds

### Floating Rate Loan Funds
These funds invest primarily in floating rate loans issued by companies, often below [investment grade](../i/investment_grade.md). These loans are usually senior secured, meaning they have a higher claim on the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s assets in the event of [default](../d/default.md).

### Floating Rate Note Funds
These funds focus on [floating rate notes](../f/floating_rate_notes.md), which are [debt](../d/debt.md) securities with a [floating interest rate](../f/floating_interest_rate.md). They typically have higher [credit](../c/credit.md) quality compared to floating rate [loan](../l/loan.md) funds and less [default risk](../d/default_risk.md).

### Floating Rate Bond Funds
Floating rate [bond](../b/bond.md) funds invest in various bonds with a [floating interest rate](../f/floating_interest_rate.md), including corporate bonds, [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), and government bonds.

## Key Metrics for Evaluating Floating Rate Funds

### Duration
[Duration](../d/duration.md) measures the sensitivity of a [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Floating rate funds generally have low durations due to their [periodic interest rate](../p/periodic_interest_rate.md) resets, making them less sensitive to rate changes.

### Credit Quality
Assessing the [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of a floating rate [fund](../f/fund.md) involves looking at the [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) instruments. Funds holding higher-rated instruments pose lower [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) compared to those holding lower-rated instruments.

### Yield
The [yield](../y/yield.md) of a floating rate [fund](../f/fund.md) represents the [income](../i/income.md) [return](../r/return.md) on the investment. It is essential to compare the [yield](../y/yield.md) with the associated [risk](../r/risk.md) levels, including [credit](../c/credit.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) risks.

### Expense Ratio
The [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md) indicates the annual fees charged by the [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md), expressed as a percentage of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets. Lower [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios can enhance net returns for investors.

## Examples of Floating Rate Funds

### Fidelity Advisor Floating Rate High Income Fund

This [fund](../f/fund.md) seeks high [income](../i/income.md) by [investing](../i/investing.md) primarily in high-[yield](../y/yield.md) floating rate loans and floating rate [debt](../d/debt.md) securities. It emphasizes maintaining a diversified portfolio to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md).

### BlackRock Floating Rate Income Fund

Invests in floating rate loans and other floating rate [debt](../d/debt.md) securities. It aims to provide high current [income](../i/income.md) while maintaining a low-[duration](../d/duration.md) portfolio to minimize [interest](../i/interest.md)-rate sensitivity.

### T. Rowe Price Floating Rate Fund

Focuses on providing high current [income](../i/income.md) through investments in floating rate loans and other floating rate [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments. The [fund](../f/fund.md) emphasizes quality and active [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Strategies for Investing in Floating Rate Funds

### Diversification
Investors should consider diversifying their investments by including floating rate funds as part of a broader fixed-[income](../i/income.md) strategy. This can help reduce overall portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md) and enhance [yield](../y/yield.md).

### Duration Management
Utilizing floating rate funds with low durations can be an effective way of managing [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), particularly during periods of expected rate hikes.

### Credit Monitoring
Regularly monitoring the [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) instruments can help investors stay informed about potential risks and make informed decisions.

### Allocation
Determining an appropriate allocation to floating rate funds within a portfolio depends on individual investment goals, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and [market](../m/market.md) outlook. Some investors may prefer a higher allocation in a rising rate environment, while others may opt for a more balanced approach.

## Conclusion

Floating rate funds [offer](../o/offer.md) a compelling investment option for those seeking protection against rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [diversification](../d/diversification.md), and potentially higher yields. However, investors must be aware of associated risks, including [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) and [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Careful evaluation of [fund](../f/fund.md) metrics and an understanding of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) instruments are essential steps in making informed investment decisions. As with any investment, consultation with a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) is advisable to ensure that floating rate funds align with one's overall [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) and objectives.
