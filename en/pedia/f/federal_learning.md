# Federated Learning

Federated Learning is an approach that allows [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models to be trained across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) decentralized devices holding local data samples, without exchanging them.

### Key Components
- **Decentralized Training:** Learning occurs locally on edge devices, with only model updates shared centrally.
- **Privacy Preservation:** Raw data never leaves the local device, enhancing data privacy.
- **[Aggregation](../a/aggregation.md) Server:** Collects and aggregates local updates to improve the global model.
- **Communication Protocols:** Efficient mechanisms to synchronize updates between devices and the central server.

### Applications
- **Mobile Applications:** Personalization of services (e.g., keyboard suggestions) without compromising privacy.
- **Healthcare:** Collaborative research across hospitals while keeping patient data confidential.
- **IoT Devices:** Improving models on smart devices without centralized data collection.
- **Financial Services:** Enhancing [fraud](../f/fraud.md) detection while maintaining [customer](../c/customer.md) data privacy.

### Advantages
- Enhances privacy by keeping data local.
- Reduces the need for large-scale centralized data storage.
- Enables collaboration across organizations without data sharing.

### Challenges
- Communication overhead and synchronization issues.
- Heterogeneity of devices and data distributions.
- Robustness against adversarial attacks on decentralized networks.

### Future Outlook
Federated learning is poised to grow as privacy concerns and data regulations intensify. Research is focused on improving communication [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), [security](../s/security.md), and model robustness in highly heterogeneous environments.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Federated Learning and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Federated Learning as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Federated Learning, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Federated Learning. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Federated Learning alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
