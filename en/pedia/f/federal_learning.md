# Federated Learning

Federated Learning is an approach that allows [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models to be trained across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) decentralized devices holding local data samples, without exchanging them.

### Key Components
- **Decentralized Training:** Learning occurs locally on edge devices, with only model updates shared centrally.
- **Privacy Preservation:** Raw data never leaves the local device, enhancing data privacy.
- **[Aggregation](../a/aggregation.md) Server:** Collects and aggregates local updates to improve the global model.
- **Communication Protocols:** Efficient mechanisms to synchronize updates between devices and the central server.

### Applications
- **Mobile Applications:** Personalization of services (e.g., keyboard suggestions) without compromising privacy.
- **Healthcare:** Collaborative research across hospitals while keeping patient data confidential.
- **IoT Devices:** Improving models on smart devices without centralized data collection.
- **Financial Services:** Enhancing [fraud](../f/fraud.md) detection while maintaining [customer](../c/customer.md) data privacy.

### Advantages
- Enhances privacy by keeping data local.
- Reduces the need for large-scale centralized data storage.
- Enables collaboration across organizations without data sharing.

### Challenges
- Communication overhead and synchronization issues.
- Heterogeneity of devices and data distributions.
- Robustness against adversarial attacks on decentralized networks.

### Future Outlook
Federated learning is poised to grow as privacy concerns and data regulations intensify. Research is focused on improving communication [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), [security](../s/security.md), and model robustness in highly heterogeneous environments.
