# Federated Learning

Federated Learning is an approach that allows machine learning models to be trained across multiple decentralized devices holding local data samples, without exchanging them.

### Key Components
- **Decentralized Training:** Learning occurs locally on edge devices, with only model updates shared centrally.
- **Privacy Preservation:** Raw data never leaves the local device, enhancing data privacy.
- **Aggregation Server:** Collects and aggregates local updates to improve the global model.
- **Communication Protocols:** Efficient mechanisms to synchronize updates between devices and the central server.

### Applications
- **Mobile Applications:** Personalization of services (e.g., keyboard suggestions) without compromising privacy.
- **Healthcare:** Collaborative research across hospitals while keeping patient data confidential.
- **IoT Devices:** Improving models on smart devices without centralized data collection.
- **Financial Services:** Enhancing fraud detection while maintaining customer data privacy.

### Advantages
- Enhances privacy by keeping data local.
- Reduces the need for large-scale centralized data storage.
- Enables collaboration across organizations without data sharing.

### Challenges
- Communication overhead and synchronization issues.
- Heterogeneity of devices and data distributions.
- Robustness against adversarial attacks on decentralized networks.

### Future Outlook
Federated learning is poised to grow as privacy concerns and data regulations intensify. Research is focused on improving communication efficiency, security, and model robustness in highly heterogeneous environments.
