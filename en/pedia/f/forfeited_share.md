# Forfeited Share

A forfeited share, in the context of [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) trading and investment, refers to a stock that an [investor](../i/investor.md) or company has forfeited or surrendered back to the issuing company because of non-[payment](../p/payment.md) or non-adherence to the company's rules.

## Understanding Forfeited Shares

Forfeited [shares](../s/shares.md) arise when a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) fails to fulfill his/her [obligations](../o/obligation.md) to the company which may include non-[payment](../p/payment.md) of call [money](../m/money.md), subscription [money](../m/money.md), or any other dues. Consequently, the company has the right to reclaim those [shares](../s/shares.md) as per the terms laid down in the [Articles of Association](../a/articles_of_association.md) or the [shareholders' agreement](../s/shareholders'_agreement.md). Upon forfeiture, these [shares](../s/shares.md) are essentially taken back by the company, and the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) loses all rights associated with them, including any potential dividends or voting rights.

### Reasons for Forfeiture

1. **Non-[Payment](../p/payment.md) of [Allotment](../a/allotment.md)/Call [Money](../m/money.md):** Companies that [issue](../i/issue.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) may do so with the stipulation that the [payment](../p/payment.md) [will](../w/will.md) be completed in installments. If a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) fails to pay any of these installments, the company has the right to forfeit the [shares](../s/shares.md).
2. **Violation of Terms and Conditions:** Shareholders must adhere to certain terms and conditions as dictated by the company’s rules. A violation can lead to forfeiture.
3. **Other Regulatory Reasons:** Other potential legal infractions or regulatory non-compliance issues might necessitate forfeiture.

### Processes Involved in Forfeiture

1. **Notice:** The company must usually serve a notice to the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md), stating the [default](../d/default.md) and giving a grace period for remedying the [default](../d/default.md).
2. **Resolution:** If no action is taken by the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) within the specified time, the board of directors has to pass a resolution to forfeit the [shares](../s/shares.md).
3. **Re-notification:** The [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) is informed of the forfeiture and the details are recorded in the register of company.
4. **Reissue:** Forfeited [shares](../s/shares.md) can be reissued to new investors as per the company’s discretion. This can sometimes be done at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to attract purchasers.

### Consequences of Forfeiture for Shareholders

- **Loss of Investment:** The primary consequence is the loss of the investment put forth to obtain the [shares](../s/shares.md) initially.
- **Loss of Rights:** Any associated rights, such as voting and [dividend](../d/dividend.md) entitlements, are nullified.
- **Financial Penalties:** Some jurisdictions may impose additional financial penalties on shareholders involved in forfeiture scenarios.

### Reissue of Forfeited Shares

Upon forfeiture, companies may reissue these [shares](../s/shares.md) either through public or private placements. The terms of the reissue often involve a lower price to make the [shares](../s/shares.md) more attractive to potential investors. Some jurisdictions may have strict rules governing the reissue to ensure fairness and compliance with securities laws.

### Legal and Accounting Treatment

- **Legal Framework:** The legislative frameworks vary by jurisdiction. Most countries have specified guidelines in their company laws that dictate how forfeiture should be conducted.
- **[Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Treatment:** From an [accounting](../a/accounting.md) perspective, the original share [capital](../c/capital.md) is reduced by the amount unpaid by the initial [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md). These are then recorded under ‘forfeited [shares](../s/shares.md) account’ until reissued, at which point any excess over the unpaid amount is credited to a share [premium](../p/premium.md) account.

### Example of Forfeiture in Action

Consider a company XYZ Ltd. Company XYZ issues 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) to a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) at $10 each to be paid in three installments of $4, $3, and $3. If the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) fails to pay the final installment of $3, XYZ Ltd. could serve a notice providing a grace period. Failure to pay within this period results in the [shares](../s/shares.md) being forfeited. XYZ Ltd. would then reissue these [shares](../s/shares.md) to a new buyer, potentially at a price adjusted for [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Case Studies and Real-World Examples

A case illustrating the concept might involve a company outlining specific procedures in their [Articles of Association](../a/articles_of_association.md) for the recovery of unpaid [shares](../s/shares.md). For example, a publicly traded company may occasionally announce forfeiture actions in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) or regulatory filings.

#### Tech Giants and Startups:
- **Facebook (Meta)** and **Google (Alphabet):** Though large tech companies maintain meticulous control over share issuance and collection practices, instances of forfeiture, if any, are disclosed in their detailed quarterly reports. These companies adhere strictly to governance codes to prevent forfeiture occurrences. URL for reference.

## Strategic Considerations

### For Investors

Investors must be fully aware of the [payment](../p/payment.md) schedules and adhere to all specified deadlines to avoid forfeiture. Diversifying investments can also help to mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with such financial commitments.

### For Companies

Companies should design [robust](../r/robust.md) mechanisms and clear communication channels to alert shareholders of impending dues and deadlines. Proactive engagement can minimize the need for forfeiture actions.

### Legal and Compliance

Companies must ensure their forfeiture processes comply with local and international laws to avoid litigation risks. Consulting with legal advisors can refine these processes to suit specific [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) frameworks.

## Summary

Forfeiture of [shares](../s/shares.md) is a significant regulatory action taken by companies to manage unpaid stock issues. Understanding the intricacies of this process, be it from the legal, [accounting](../a/accounting.md), or investment standpoint, is crucial for both companies issuing [shares](../s/shares.md) and investors holding them. By staying vigilant and adhering to stipulated guidelines, stakeholders can avoid the complex implications of share forfeiture.
