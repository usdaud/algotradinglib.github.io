# Fibonacci Time Zones

Fibonacci time zones are vertical lines plotted at intervals based on Fibonacci numbers. They are used to estimate when a trend might pause or reverse, focusing on time rather than price.

## Construction
- Select a meaningful pivot point in time, such as a major high or low.
- Mark vertical lines at Fibonacci intervals from that date, such as 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 21 periods.

## Interpretation
When price approaches a time zone line, traders watch for signs of a change in momentum. The time zone does not predict direction, only a window of potential activity.

## Example
A stock makes a major low on day 0. The Fibonacci time zones are drawn forward. On day 13, price forms a reversal candle and begins a new trend. The time zone helps highlight the timing window rather than the price level.

## Strengths and limits
Time zones are most useful with other tools like trend lines or momentum indicators. On their own they can be too vague for precise entries.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Fibonacci Time Zones and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Fibonacci Time Zones as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Fibonacci Time Zones, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Fibonacci Time Zones. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Fibonacci Time Zones alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
