# Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)

Fear of missing out is a behavioral bias that pushes traders to chase a move because they feel late to the opportunity. It often leads to entries at poor prices, weak risk control, and emotional decisions.

## How it shows up
- Entering after a large candle because price moved without you.
- Increasing size to make back a missed profit.
- Abandoning a plan to follow a fast move.
- Ignoring risk limits to stay in a trade.

## Why it matters
FOMO trades typically have bad risk to reward because the easy part of the move already happened. The trader is buying near resistance or selling near support. Even if the trend continues, the stop must be wide and the expected payoff is limited.

## Mitigation techniques
- Define entry rules and follow them even when price runs.
- Use alerts and limit orders instead of market orders.
- Track missed trades to learn patterns without revenge trading.
- Reduce size when emotional pressure is high.

## Example
A stock breaks out and runs 6 percent in five minutes. A trader jumps in at the top to avoid missing the move, only to be stopped out on the first pullback. A planned entry at a pullback would have offered a better price and a tighter stop.

## Long term perspective
Missing a trade is not a failure. Consistency and discipline usually beat chasing a single move.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.
