# Flotation

Flotation, in the context of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), refers to the process by which a company goes public by issuing [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public through an initial public [offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO). This financial mechanism allows a [private company](../p/private_company.md) to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by selling ownership stakes in the form of [equity](../e/equity.md) to institutional and retail investors. The [shares](../s/shares.md) are then traded on public stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md), creating [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and an opportunity for the [shares](../s/shares.md) to appreciate in [value](../v/value.md) based on [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md).

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), which utilizes computer algorithms to execute trades at high speed and accuracy, has a significant impact on the flotational process. This interplay between flotation and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) covers various aspects:

## Key Components of Flotation

1. **Initial Public [Offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO):**
   An IPO represents a company's first [sale](../s/sale.md) of stock to the public. Companies opt for an IPO to:
   - Raise [capital](../c/capital.md) for [expansion](../e/expansion.md), operations, or other strategic purposes.
   - Enhance public profile and [brand awareness](../b/brand_awareness.md).
   - Enable early investors to realize gains on their investments.
   
   The IPO process involves several steps:
   - **Engaging Underwriters:** [Investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) act as underwriters to manage the IPO, providing advice on pricing, timing, and structuring.
   - **Regulatory Filings:** The company files a registration statement (Form S-1 in the U.S.) with the regulatory authority (e.g., the SEC).
   - **Roadshows:** Company executives present the [business](../b/business.md) case to potential investors.
   - **Pricing:** The underwriters and company agree on the IPO price based on [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) and company [valuation](../v/valuation.md).
   - **Launch:** The [shares](../s/shares.md) are made available to the public through an [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

2. **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/accountability.md) in IPOs:**
   [Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) plays a vital role in the IPO process, especially during the:
   - **[Price Discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) Phase:** Algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to provide insights into potential [demand](../d/demand.md) and appropriate pricing.
   - **[Book Building](../b/book_building.md):** Algorithms help gather and process [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), contributing to a more accurate [demand](../d/demand.md) assessment.
   - **[Market](../m/market.md) Making:** Post-IPO, algorithms facilitate [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and stabilize prices by matching buy and sell orders efficiently.

3. **Secondary Trading:**
   Once the IPO [shares](../s/shares.md) begin trading, [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) continues to influence the [market](../m/market.md) by:
   - **Automated [Execution](../e/execution.md):** Algorithms execute trades based on predefined criteria, ensuring speed and precision.
   - **[Market](../m/market.md) Impact Minimization:** Strategies are employed to reduce the impact of large trades on the [market](../m/market.md).
   - **[Liquidity Provision](../l/liquidity_provision.md):** Algorithms provide continuous [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by making markets in the [shares](../s/shares.md).

4. **High-Frequency Trading (HFT):**
   HFT, a specialized form of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), involves executing orders at extremely high speeds. In the context of recent IPOs, HFT can:
   - Exploit short-term mispricings.
   - Enhance [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md).
   - Increase [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in newly [listed](../l/listed.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md).

5. **Regulation and Compliance:**
   Regulators monitor algorithmic and HFT activities to ensure fair trading practices and [market](../m/market.md) integrity. They aim to prevent manipulations, such as:
   - **[Spoofing](../s/spoofing.md):** Placing large orders with the intent to cancel, creating false [demand](../d/demand.md).
   - **[Quote Stuffing](../q/quote_stuffing.md):** Flooding the [market](../m/market.md) with orders to slow competitors' algorithms.

6. **Notable Companies in [Algorithmic Trading](../a/accountability.md):**
   Several leading firms specialize in providing [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) solutions and technology platforms:
   - **Virtu Financial:** A technology-driven [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) provider in global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) (https://www.virtu.com).
   - **Citadel Securities:** A global [market maker](../m/market_maker.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) (https://www.citadelsecurities.com).
   - **Two Sigma:** An [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) that uses advanced [data science](../d/data_science_in_trading.md) and technology (https://www.twosigma.com).

## Strategies and Models

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) incorporates various strategies and models to optimize the flotation process and secondary trading:

1. **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** 
   This strategy leverages statistical models to identify pricing inefficiencies in the stock. The algorithms execute trades to exploit these inefficiencies, seeking to [profit](../p/profit.md) from [market](../m/market.md) correlations.

2. **[Momentum Trading](../m/momentum_trading.md):**
   [Momentum](../m/momentum.md)-based algorithms track stock price trends and [volume patterns](../v/volume_patterns.md) to identify potential gains. These models [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the stock's [momentum](../m/momentum.md) following an IPO to execute timely trades.

3. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md):**
   [Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies assume that stock prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical mean. Algorithms identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions and [trade](../t/trade.md) to capture the expected reversion.

4. **[Market Sentiment Analysis](../m/market_sentiment_analysis.md):**
   Incorporating [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP) and machine learning, algorithms analyze news sentiment, [social media](../s/social_media.md) trends, and other data sources to gauge [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and predict price movements.

5. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Seeking:**
   Algorithms are designed to seek optimal [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for executing large trades with minimal impact. These [smart order routing](../s/smart_order_routing.md) strategies adjust [execution](../e/execution.md) based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
