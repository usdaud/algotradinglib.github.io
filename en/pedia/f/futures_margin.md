# Futures Margin

Futures margin is the collateral required to open and maintain a futures position. It is not a down payment, but a performance bond that covers potential losses.

## Types of margin
- Initial margin: required to open a position.
- Maintenance margin: minimum equity required to keep the position open.
- Variation margin: daily gains or losses credited or debited as the contract is marked to market.

## How it works
At the end of each trading day the exchange sets a settlement price and all positions are marked to market. If account equity falls below maintenance margin, a margin call is issued to restore the required level.

## Example
A contract requires 5,000 in initial margin and 4,000 in maintenance margin. A trader starts with 5,500. After losses, equity drops to 3,900 and a margin call is issued.

## Risk considerations
Leverage can amplify both gains and losses. Holding margin buffers reduces the chance of forced liquidation during volatile periods.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Futures Margin and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Futures Margin as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Futures Margin, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Futures Margin. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Futures Margin alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
