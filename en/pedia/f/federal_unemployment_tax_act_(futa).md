# Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA)

The Federal [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) Tax Act (FUTA) is a United States federal law that imposes a [payroll tax](../p/payroll_tax.md) on businesses with employees to [fund](../f/fund.md) state workforce agencies. It is a critical component of the federal-state [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) system, which provides payments of [unemployment compensation](../u/unemployment_compensation.md) to workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. This tax helps to ensure that unemployed workers receive financial assistance while they seek new employment opportunities. The tax is a collaborative effort between federal and state governments, aiming to maintain a safety net for workers during times of economic downturns and job transitions.

## Historical Background

The Federal [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) Tax Act was established as part of the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Act of 1935 during President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s [New Deal](../n/new_deal.md). The goal was to provide a more [robust](../r/robust.md) economic safety net for Americans suffering from the effects of the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md). Prior to this legislation, [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) in the United States was not widespread, and many individuals without work faced severe financial hardship.

The foundational principle behind FUTA was to create a funding mechanism that would ensure states could afford to provide [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) benefits without severe financial strain. By requiring employers to contribute to the system, the federal government aimed to create a steady and predictable stream of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) that could be distributed to state [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) programs.

## How FUTA Works

### Employer Responsibilities

Under FUTA, employers are responsible for paying the [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) tax. The tax is applied to the first $7,000 paid to each employee as wages during the year. Unlike some [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), employees do not pay FUTA tax or have it deducted from their wages. The responsibility solely lies with employers.

### Tax Rate

The FUTA [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) is 6.0% of the first $7,000 of each employee's wages. However, if the employer is also liable for state [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and has good compliance standing with their state’s [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) programs, they may be eligible for a [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) of up to 5.4%. This can reduce the effective FUTA [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) to as low as 0.6%.

### Filing and Payment

Employers are required to file IRS Form 940 annually to report their FUTA tax liabilities. Payments may need to be made more frequently, such as on a quarterly [basis](../b/basis.md), depending on the amount of tax owed during the year. If the cumulative amount of unpaid FUTA tax exceeds $500 in a quarter, the employer must [deposit](../d/deposit.md) the tax by the end of the following month.

### State Unemployment Systems

States have their [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) programs and tax rates, but the federal government provides guidelines and oversight to ensure the programs meet national standards. State [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), paid by employers, are used for compensation benefits to eligible unemployed workers within the state. State tax rates vary and are determined based on factors such as the state's [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and the employer’s history of claims.

## Eligibility for Unemployment Benefits

[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) benefits provide temporary financial assistance to eligible workers who have lost their jobs. Eligibility criteria for workers include:

- **Involuntary Job Loss**: Workers must be unemployed through no fault of their own. This generally means that they were laid off rather than fired for cause.
- **Work History**: Workers must meet state-specific requirements in terms of previous [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and length of employment.
- **Active Job Search**: Workers must be actively seeking new employment to qualify for benefits.

The amount and [duration](../d/duration.md) of benefits can vary significantly between states, but the aim is to [offer](../o/offer.md) temporary support while the recipients seek new work.

## Impact on Employers

The impacts of FUTA on employers include:

1. **Financial Responsibility**: Employers must account for the cost of FUTA [taxes](../t/taxes.md) when budgeting for [payroll](../p/payroll.md). Even though the amount may seem small, it is combined with other [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and contributions, increasing the overall cost of employment.

2. **Compliance Requirements**: Employers must ensure that they correctly calculate their FUTA liabilities, file the necessary forms on time, and make appropriate payments. Non-compliance can result in penalties and [interest](../i/interest.md) charges.

3. **Interaction with State [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: Employers must navigate both federal and state requirements. While FUTA provides a [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) for state [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid, this creates an administrative burden to track and report both sets of [taxes](../t/taxes.md) accurately.

## Recession and Economic Stability

During economic downturns, the [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates can surge, placing significant demands on the state [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) systems. FUTA [taxes](../t/taxes.md) contribute to a federal [trust fund](../t/trust_fund.md) meant to assist states when their funds run low. This federal support ensures that states can continue to pay [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) benefits even during prolonged periods of high [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates spiked dramatically, and state [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) systems were strained. The federal government stepped in with various relief measures, including additional [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) benefits funded through federal programs.

## FUTA Administration

The administration of FUTA involves various federal and state agencies working in concert:

- **IRS (Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service)**: At the federal level, the IRS administers the collection of FUTA [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and ensures compliance.
- **DOL (Department of Labor)**: The U.S. Department of Labor oversees the federal aspect of the [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) program, sets guidelines, and provides oversight.
- **State Workforce Agencies**: These agencies manage the collection of state [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) benefits within their jurisdictions. They also ensure that [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) programs align with federal guidelines.

## Future of FUTA

There have been discussions and proposals to reform FUTA to better suit the modern economic landscape. Some suggestions include adjusting the wage base on which the tax is levied (currently maintained since 1983 at $7,000), revisiting the tax rates, and improving the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the system. These considerations are influenced by the evolving nature of work, changes in employment trends, and economic factors.

Overall, FUTA remains a cornerstone of the U.S. [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) system, providing critical financial support during times of job loss and economic instability. The collaborative federal-state framework ensures a [robust](../r/robust.md) safety net, helping to stabilize individual financial situations and the broader [economy](../e/economy.md) during downturns.
