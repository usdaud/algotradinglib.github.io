# Futures Settlement Price

The futures settlement price is the official price used to mark positions to market at the end of each trading day. It determines variation margin and serves as the reference for daily profit and loss.

## Determination
Exchanges publish a settlement methodology that can include a closing auction, a volume weighted average, or a specific time window. The goal is to represent a fair and robust price.

## Why it matters
- It drives daily margin calls and credits.
- It can differ from the last trade, especially in thin markets.
- It affects risk metrics and position valuations.

## Example
A trader holds a long position. The settlement price is below the previous day. The difference is deducted from the account as variation margin. If equity falls too low, a margin call is triggered.

## Practical notes
Traders who hold positions overnight should track settlement methodology, especially when the market is volatile or illiquid near the close.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Futures Settlement Price and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Futures Settlement Price as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Futures Settlement Price, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Futures Settlement Price. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Futures Settlement Price alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
