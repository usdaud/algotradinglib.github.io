# Form 1095-C

## Introduction to Form 1095-C

Form 1095-C is a tax form used in the United States, primarily for reporting [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) coverage offered by employers to their employees under the [Affordable Care Act](../a/affordable_care_act.md) (ACA). This form plays a significant role in ensuring that businesses comply with the ACA's Employer Shared Responsibility Provisions. While it may seem unrelated to [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (or "algo trading"), understanding Form 1095-C is essential for employers in the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md) to manage compliance and avoid potential penalties.

## Purpose of Form 1095-C

The primary purpose of Form 1095-C is to report whether an employer offered [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) coverage to its full-time employees and their dependents, and if so, the level of coverage offered. This information helps the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) enforce the individual mandate that requires individuals to maintain minimum essential health coverage or face a penalty.

## Key Sections of Form 1095-C

Form 1095-C consists of several parts, each providing crucial information regarding employer-provided health coverage:

1. **Part I: Employee and Employer Information**
 - This section includes basic details about the employee and the employer, such as names, addresses, and [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Numbers (SSNs) or Employer Identification Numbers (EINs).

2. **Part II: Employee [Offer](../o/offer.md) and Coverage**
 - This part details the type of health coverage offered to the employee, the lowest-cost monthly [premium](../p/premium.md) for self-only coverage, and the applicable safe harbor codes, if any.

3. **Part III: Covered Individuals**
 - This section is filled out only if the employer provides self-insured coverage, listing all individuals covered under the employer’s health plan, including employees and their dependents.

## Reporting Requirements for Employers

Employers with 50 or more full-time employees, including full-time equivalent employees (Applicable Large Employers or ALEs), are required to file Form 1095-C for each full-time employee. These forms help the IRS determine whether the employer has complied with the ACA's Employer Mandate.

## Filing and Distribution

Employers must file Form 1095-C with the IRS and furnish a copy to each covered employee. The deadlines for these tasks are typically as follows:
- **Filing with the IRS**: Usually by March 31 if filing electronically, or by February 28 if filing by paper.
- **Furnishing to Employees**: By January 31.

If the deadlines fall on a weekend or holiday, they are extended to the next [business](../b/business.md) day.

## Compliance and Penalties

Non-compliance with the reporting requirements of Form 1095-C can result in significant penalties. Employers must ensure accuracy and timeliness in filing and distributing these forms. Penalties may arise from:
- Failing to file the forms.
- Failing to furnish the forms to employees.
- Filing incorrect or incomplete forms.

## Form 1095-C in the Context of Algo Trading Companies

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) companies, like any other businesses, must comply with the ACA if they meet the criteria of ALEs. Given the often high [turnover](../t/turnover.md) and the specific nature of employment in the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md), these companies need [robust](../r/robust.md) HR and compliance systems to manage their workforce's health coverage and ensure accurate reporting.

Some of the considerations for an algo trading [firm](../f/firm.md) regarding Form 1095-C include:
- **Accurate tracking of employee statuses**: Employees’ full-time or part-time status may change frequently, and accurate tracking is essential for proper reporting.
- **Integration with HR and [payroll](../p/payroll.md) systems**: Automated systems can help ensure that data required for Form 1095-C is accurate and up-to-date.
- **Awareness of IRS updates**: Staying informed about changes in IRS regulations regarding Form 1095-C is crucial for continuous compliance.
