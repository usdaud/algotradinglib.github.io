# Front Month Contracts

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as algo trading, uses computer programs and algorithms to execute trades based on predefined criteria. A vital element in this sphere is the understanding and application of forward and [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), one of which is the front month contract. This document delves into the details of front month contracts and their significance in algo trading.

### Front Month Contracts Defined

A front month contract refers to the nearest [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) in the financial [market](../m/market.md). It is the contract with the closest upcoming delivery or settlement date. For instance, if it is January and a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is set to expire in February, that would be considered the front month contract. These contracts are crucial because they usually exhibit higher [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and more accurate tracking of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) compared to longer-dated contracts.

### Importance in Algorithmic Trading

The importance of front month contracts in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) cannot be overstated. Here are several key reasons:

1. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Front month contracts are usually the most [liquid](../l/liquid.md), making it easier and cheaper to enter and exit positions. This high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) reduces the impact of [slippage](../s/slippage.md), which occurs when the [execution](../e/execution.md) of an [order](../o/order.md) causes the price to move.

2. **Accuracy**: Front month contracts have prices that tend to be closer to the actual [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s current price. This reduces the [basis risk](../b/basis_risk.md), which is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [futures](../f/futures.md) price might diverge from the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md).

3. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: These contracts often have higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) than longer-dated contracts, presenting more opportunities for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) strategies.

### Trading Strategies

There are numerous [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) involving front month contracts that are widely utilized in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md):

1. **Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: This strategy involves taking a position in both a front month contract and a longer-dated contract simultaneously. Traders [profit](../p/profit.md) from changes in the price difference between these contracts.

2. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: When discrepancies arise between the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) in the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md) and its price in the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md), traders use front month contracts to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on these differences.

3. **[Momentum Trading](../m/momentum_trading.md)**: Algorithms are set to detect [momentum](../m/momentum.md) in the front month contract's price movements, allowing traders to take positions accordingly.

### Application and Utility

Front month contracts are widely used in a variety of markets, including:

- **Commodities**: Markets like [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md), natural gas, gold, and silver depend heavily on front month contracts for hedging and speculative purposes.

Example: [Crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) front month contracts are crucial because the commodities [market](../m/market.md) is heavily influenced by near-term [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) factors.

- **Equities**: Stock [index futures](../i/index_futures.md), such as the S&P 500 front month [futures](../f/futures.md), help traders [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the overall [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) performance without having to [trade](../t/trade.md) individual [stocks](../s/stock.md).

- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Treasury bonds and [Eurodollar](../e/eurodollar.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) often focus on the front month to gauge short-term [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) expectations.

### Example of Companies

Several companies and exchanges specialize in [offering](../o/offering.md) a [range](../r/range.md) of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), including front month contracts. Some well-known firms include:

- **CME Group**: CME Group offers a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), including front month contracts across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) classes like equities, commodities, and [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md).

- **Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE)**: ICE provides markets for trading [futures](../f/futures.md) across global commodities, currencies, and financial products.

- **[Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md)**: Nasdaq Futures offers trading opportunities in [equity](../e/equity.md) [index futures](../i/index_futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md), often highlighting front month contracts.

### Risks and Management

While front month contracts [offer](../o/offer.md) many advantages, they also come with specific risks:

1. **High [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: The same [volatility](../v/volatility.md) that provides trading opportunities can also lead to significant losses if not managed correctly.

2. **Roll [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Traders who wish to maintain their position in the [market](../m/market.md) need to "roll" contracts (shift their position from an expiring front month contract to a new front month contract), which can incur additional costs and risks.

To manage these risks, traders often use advanced algorithms that dynamically adjust positions and implement [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) to mitigate potential losses.

### Conclusion

Understanding front month contracts is essential for anyone involved in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). These contracts provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), accuracy, and trading opportunities that are unparalleled compared to their longer-dated counterparts. However, traders must also be aware of the inherent risks and utilize advanced [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the benefits while minimizing potential downsides. By doing so, traders can enhance their performance and achieve better outcomes in the highly competitive world of algo trading.
