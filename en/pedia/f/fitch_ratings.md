### Data Collection and Analysis

The initial step involves collecting comprehensive financial data, [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), and other relevant information from publicly available sources and direct submissions from the entities being rated.

### Quantitative and Qualitative Assessment

Fitch analysts use various [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) to evaluate [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md), [leverage ratios](../l/leverage_ratios.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and other critical metrics. This quantitative assessment is complemented by a [qualitative analysis](../q/qualitative_analysis.md) that considers factors such as management quality, [market](../m/market.md) position, competitive landscape, and [industry](../i/industry.md) trends.

### Rating Committee

The final [rating](../r/rating.md) decision is made by a [rating](../r/rating.md) committee comprising senior analysts and subject matter experts. The committee reviews the analytical findings, discusses potential risks, and determines the final [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) based on consensus.

### Monitoring and Surveillance

Fitch continuously monitors the entities and instruments it rates to ensure the ratings remain relevant and accurate. This involves periodic reviews, updates based on new information, and adjustments to ratings as necessary.
