# Funds From Operations (FFO)

Funds From Operations (FFO) is a key financial metric commonly used by [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment trusts (REITs) to measure cash generated from their operations. The metric excludes gains or losses from property sales and other items that are considered to be non-recurring, thus providing a clearer picture of a company’s recurring [income](../i/income.md).

## Calculation of FFO

FFO is calculated by adding [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization to [earnings](../e/earnings.md), and then subtracting any gains on sales of properties. The formula is commonly represented as:

\[ \text{FFO} = \text{Net Income} + \text{[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)} + \text{Amortization} - \text{Gains on Sales of Assets} \]

## Importance of FFO

### Standardization

FFO is a standardized metric used across the REIT [industry](../i/industry.md), allowing for easier comparisons between different companies. This is achieved through the guidelines set by the National Association of [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment Trusts (NAREIT), which provides consistency in reporting.

### Non-Cash Adjustments

Traditional net [income](../i/income.md) includes several non-cash items like [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization, which can distort actual [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md). FFO adjusts for these by adding them back, providing a more accurate reflection of operational performance and [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

### Exclusion of Non-Recurring Items

By excluding gains on property sales and other [extraordinary items](../e/extraordinary_item.md), FFO focuses on the sustainable and recurring parts of a REIT’s [business](../b/business.md) operations. This makes it particularly useful for investors looking to understand the core [earnings](../e/earnings.md) power of these funds.

## Limitations of FFO

Despite its [utility](../u/utility.md), FFO is not a perfect measure and has some limitations:

### Ignores Capital Expenditures

FFO does not take into account the [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures that are necessary to maintain the assets, which can provide an inflated view of the cash available for distributions.

### Not a GAAP Measure

FFO is a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md)) measure, meaning it is not audited by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards. This could potentially lead to inconsistencies in how different companies calculate and report FFO.

### Variability in Adjustments

While FFO is standardized to some extent, companies might still apply different levels of discretion in their adjustments, especially when it comes to non-recurring items. This requires investors to carefully review the footnotes and reconciliations provided in the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

## Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)

To address some of the limitations of FFO, many analysts use a related measure called Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO). This metric goes a step further by subtracting maintenance [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures and other non-cash items, [offering](../o/offering.md) a more refined view of the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) available for distributions. The formula can be represented as:

\[ \text{AFFO} = \text{FFO} - \text{Maintenance CapEx} - \text{Straight-lining of rents} - \text{Leasing Costs} \]

## Practical Example

### Case of Realty Income Corporation

Realty [Income](../i/income.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is a renowned REIT that specializes in commercial properties. The company regularly reports its FFO to investors and stakeholders. By analyzing the FFO, investors can discern:

- The [recurring revenue](../r/recurring_revenue.md) generated from lease agreements.
- The impact of property acquisitions or disposals.
- The core [earnings](../e/earnings.md) power devoid of non-recurring gains or losses.

For more detailed information on how FFO is reported by Realty [Income](../i/income.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), see their filings.

## Conclusion

Funds From Operations (FFO) is an essential metric for evaluating the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of REITs, [offering](../o/offering.md) insights that are not available through traditional net [income](../i/income.md). It provides a clearer picture of the recurring [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) by adjusting for non-cash and non-recurring items. Despite its limitations, FFO, and its more refined cousin AFFO, remain indispensable tools for investors looking to assess the sustainability and performance of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investments.
