# Form 2439

## Overview

Form 2439, issued by the IRS, is a tax document used to notify shareholders of the undistributed long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains of a regulated [investment company](../i/investment_company.md) (RIC) or a [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment [trust](../t/trust.md) (REIT). This form is vital for taxpayers who need to report these undistributed [capital](../c/capital.md) gains and pay the corresponding [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Its purpose is to ensure that the [income](../i/income.md) is reported accurately and the correct [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are paid.

## Purpose and Use

### Regulated Investment Companies (RICs)

Regulated Investment Companies, commonly mutual funds, are entities that pool funds from many investors to purchase securities. They are required to distribute at least 90% of their [income](../i/income.md), excluding net [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, to shareholders to qualify for certain tax benefits. When a RIC does not distribute all its net [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, those gains are considered undistributed and are reported on Form 2439.

### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)

REITs are companies that own, operate, or [finance](../f/finance.md) [income](../i/income.md)-producing [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). Similar to RICs, they must distribute the majority of their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) to shareholders to maintain their [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) status. If they retain part of their net [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, those gains are reported to shareholders via Form 2439.

### Shareholder's Role

As a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md), receiving Form 2439 means that you need to report the indicated undistributed long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains on your [tax return](../t/tax_return.md). The form also informs you of the amount of tax paid by the RIC or REIT on your behalf. This is crucial for taxpayers as they may claim a federal [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) for the amount paid.

## Components of Form 2439

### Part I - Undistributed Long-Term Capital Gains

This section provides details about the undistributed long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains. The key pieces of information include:
- Total undistributed long-term [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md).
- Amount allocated to each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md).
- Dates connected to the transactions.

### Part II - Tax Paid by the RIC or REIT

Details about the [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax paid by the RIC or REIT on behalf of the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) are captured here. This is essential for determining the amount of federal [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) that the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) can claim.

### Part III - Shareholder's Tax Obligations and Tax Credits

This part explains the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md)'s responsibilities in terms of reporting the undistributed long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains and claiming tax credits for the federal tax paid on those gains. This segment helps clarify the tax filing process for affected shareholders.

## Filing and Reporting

### For RICs and REITs

The entities are responsible for completing and distributing Form 2439 to shareholders. They must also file a copy with the IRS. RICs and REITs need to ensure the accuracy of the information and timely [distribution](../d/distribution.md) to enable shareholders to meet their tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### For Shareholders

Shareholders should report the undistributed long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, as indicated on Form 2439, on their individual tax returns. They must also claim the corresponding [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) for the [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax paid on their behalf. The specifics of where to report these figures [will](../w/will.md) depend on their [return](../r/return.md) type and [filing status](../f/filing_status.md).

## Example Scenario

Consider a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) that retains $10,000 of long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains. If you own 1% of the [shares](../s/shares.md), you would receive Form 2439 reporting $100 of undistributed long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains attributed to you. The form would also show the amount of federal tax paid on your behalf, allowing you to claim a [credit](../c/credit.md) when filing your [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

## Importance for Tax Compliance

Form 2439 ensures accurate reporting and compliance with tax laws. It aligns the undistributed [capital](../c/capital.md) gains with the shareholders' tax filings, thereby preventing [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md) and ensuring that all [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) is appropriately taxed.

## Accessing Form 2439

Form 2439 can typically be provided in a physical format or an electronic format by the RIC or REIT. Shareholders can also view this on their investment statements or relevant sections within their online accounts if provided by the [investment company](../i/investment_company.md).
