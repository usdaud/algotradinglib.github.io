## Introduction

[Form 2106](../f/form_2106_employee_business_expenses.md)-EZ, also known as the "Unreimbursed Employee [Business](../b/business.md) Expenses" form, was utilized by employees to report any [business](../b/business.md)-related expenses that were not reimbursed by their employers. This form simplified the process of claiming deductions for certain [business](../b/business.md)-related expenses, ensuring employees could potentially reduce their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). [Note](../n/note.md): As of the 2018 tax year, due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), [Form 2106](../f/form_2106_employee_business_expenses.md)-EZ is no longer used for most employees because the unreimbursed employee expenses [deduction](../d/deduction.md) was eliminated for tax years 2018 through 2025.

## Overview of Form 2106-EZ

[Form 2106](../f/form_2106_employee_business_expenses.md)-EZ is used to claim deductions on your [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) for expenses incurred as an employee that are not reimbursed by your employer. These can include expenses such as [business](../b/business.md) travel, transportation, meals, and other miscellaneous expenses directly related to your job. The form was a simpler version of [Form 2106](../f/form_2106_employee_business_expenses.md), intended for employees not using the more complex reporting necessities covered in the full form. The objective of [Form 2106](../f/form_2106_employee_business_expenses.md)-EZ was to provide an easier method for employees to deduct these expenses without the need for exhaustive record-keeping.

### **Key Highlights**:

- Intended for employees incurring unreimbursed [business](../b/business.md) expenses.

## Eligibility Criteria for Filing Form 2106-EZ

To qualify for using [Form 2106](../f/form_2106_employee_business_expenses.md)-EZ, an employee must meet specific criteria. Importantly, the individual:
- Must be an employee deducting ordinary and necessary expenses incurred during the job.
- Must not receive [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) from the employer for these expenses.
- Must not be deducting expenses for a job requiring a different type of [deduction](../d/deduction.md) method such as those associated with a [home office](../h/home_office.md).
- Expenses should be directly related to the employee's job performance and necessary for executing job-related responsibilities.

## Specific Instructions for Completing Form 2106-EZ

### Part I: Employee Business Expenses

**Line 1:** Enter the total expenses paid or incurred while performing your job duties. This includes transportation, lodging, and other job-related expenses.
**Line 2:** Subtract any employer reimbursements received.
**Line 3:** Calculate the difference between lines 1 and 2 to determine the unreimbursed expenses.
**Line 4:** Enter any parking fees, tolls, and transportation costs not included in line 1.
**Line 5:** Add lines 3 and 4 to determine the total unreimbursed expenses.

### Part II: Vehicle Expenses

**Line 6:** If claiming vehicle expenses, [check](../c/check.md) the box to specify how the [deduction](../d/deduction.md) is determined (standard mileage rate or actual expenses incurred).
**Line 7:** Enter the total mileage driven for [business](../b/business.md) purposes.
**Line 8:** Multiply the [business](../b/business.md) mileage by the standard mileage rate to calculate deductible vehicle expenses.
**Line 9:** Consolidate these figures to provide a summary of all vehicle and other unreimbursed [business](../b/business.md) expenses.

## Record Keeping Requirements

Maintaining accurate and detailed records is crucial for substantiating any claims made on [Form 2106](../f/form_2106_employee_business_expenses.md)-EZ. Employees should retain:
- [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) for travel, lodging, meals, and equipment purchases.
- Mileage logs detailing [business](../b/business.md) use of a personal vehicle.
- Statements or records from employers confirming that expenses were not reimbursed.

## Common Deductible Expenses

### Travel Expenses
Deductions in this category include the costs of airfare, hotels, rental cars, and any other expenses tied to [business](../b/business.md) travel. Employees can deduct these expenses if they are convincingly job-related and necessary for meeting job responsibilities.

### Transportation Costs
Eligible transportation expenses cover the costs of getting from one work location to another, such as taxi fares, public transportation costs, and the standard mileage rate for the use of a personal vehicle.

### Other Business Expenses
Other deductible expenses can include dues to professional organizations, the cost of work-required publications, job-specific equipment, and other non-reimbursed expenses necessary for carrying out one’s job in a professional manner.

## Limitations and Restrictions on Deductions

The IRS imposes several limitations and restrictions concerning the deductions claimed using [Form 2106](../f/form_2106_employee_business_expenses.md)-EZ:
- The total unreimbursed expenses must exceed 2% of the employee’s adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) (AGI).
- Certain expenses, such as tuition and [home office](../h/home_office.md) deductions, require different forms and methods for [deduction](../d/deduction.md).

## Alternates and Successors to Form 2106-EZ

With the enactment of the TCJA, most employees are no longer eligible to claim unreimbursed [business](../b/business.md) expenses for the tax years 2018 through 2025. Instead, employees may need to discuss potential adjustments to their employment agreements or seek [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) directly from employers. Self-employed individuals may use other deductions to manage their [business](../b/business.md) expenses effectively.

## Practical Use Cases

Consider an employee required to travel frequently for job-related purposes. The cost of travel, such as flights, accommodation, and meals, can be claimed as deductibles if not reimbursed by the employer. For another example, an employee needing to attend job-related training sessions might deduct tuition and material costs, provided these are not reimbursed.

## Filing the Form: Step-by-Step Process

1. **Gather Documentation:** Collect all relevant [receipts](../r/receipt.md), mileage logs, and [expense](../e/expense.md) reports.
2. **Complete Part I:** Enter all unreimbursed expenses as outlined above.
3. **Complete Part II:** If claiming vehicle expenses, [check](../c/check.md) the appropriate box and provide details on mileage and costs.
4. **Submit:** Attach [Form 2106](../f/form_2106_employee_business_expenses.md)-EZ to your [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

## Potential Errors and How to Avoid Them

Common mistakes include:
- Insufficient documentation to substantiate the expenses claimed.
- Incorrectly calculating mileage or other expenses.
- Failing to subtract any partial reimbursements received from the employer.
- Misinterpreting the IRS guidelines on deductible expenses.

To avoid these pitfalls, ensure thorough documentation and consider consulting a tax professional.

## Conclusion

[Form 2106](../f/form_2106_employee_business_expenses.md)-EZ offered a streamlined way for employees to deduct unreimbursed [business](../b/business.md) expenses directly tied to their job performance. Though its use has been largely limited post-2018, understanding its application provides valuable [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) insights for handling job-related expenditures. Employees should now seek direct reimbursements or explore other [deduction](../d/deduction.md) methods to manage their [business](../b/business.md)-related expenses effectively under current tax laws.
