# Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)

The Fair [Credit](../c/credit.md) Reporting Act (FCRA) is a United States federal law enacted to promote the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of consumer information contained in the files of consumer reporting agencies (CRAs). The FCRA is a part of a comprehensive scheme to address [consumer credit](../c/consumer_credit.md), ensure the confidentiality of [credit](../c/credit.md) information, and regulate the collection, dissemination, and use of consumer information, including [consumer credit](../c/consumer_credit.md) information.

## Background and Purpose

The FCRA was enacted in 1970 as part of an effort to regulate the consumer reporting [industry](../i/industry.md). The primary objectives of the Act are to:

1. Ensure the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies.
2. Enable consumers to access their [credit report](../c/credit_report.md).
3. Establish guidelines regarding the collection, dissemination, and use of [consumer credit](../c/consumer_credit.md) information.
4. Provide mechanisms for consumers to dispute and correct inaccuracies in their [credit report](../c/credit_report.md).
5. Set limitations on who may access consumer information and for what purposes.

## Key Elements of the FCRA

### Consumer Rights

The FCRA grants several critical rights to consumers, including:

- **Access to Information**: Consumers have the right to know what information is being held about them by consumer reporting agencies. They have the ability to request and obtain a free [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) once every 12 months from each of the three major [credit](../c/credit.md) reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
- **Notification of Adverse Actions**: If a consumer is denied [credit](../c/credit.md), employment, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), or other benefits based on information from a [credit report](../c/credit_report.md), the entity that made the decision must notify the consumer and provide the name, address, and phone number of the CRA that supplied the report.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Consumers have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information in their [credit report](../c/credit_report.md). CRAs are required to investigate disputes and correct or delete inaccuracies within 30 days.
- **Requisites for Employment Screenings**: Employers must get written permission from job applicants before obtaining their [credit](../c/credit.md) reports. If adverse action is taken based on the [credit report](../c/credit_report.md), the employer must provide the applicant with a copy of the report and a summary of their rights under the FCRA.
- **Protection of Medical Information**: The FCRA limits the sharing of medical information with creditors and restricts CRAs from including medical information on consumer reports without specific consent from the consumer.

### Obligations on Consumer Reporting Agencies (CRAs)

CRAs must adhere to several stringent [obligations](../o/obligation.md) under the FCRA, including:

- **Accuracy and Fairness**: CRAs must follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they provide.
- **Reinvestigation**: Upon a dispute by a consumer, CRAs are obligated to reinvestigate and correct any inaccurate or incomplete information usually within 30 days.
- **Notification of Dispute Results**: CRAs must notify the consumer of the results of its reinvestigation. If the information is found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable, the CRA must promptly delete or correct it.
- **Limiting the Usage of Consumer Reports**: CRAs can only provide consumer reports to individuals or entities with a legitimate need, including creditors, insurers, employers, and landlords, and even then, only for specified permissible purposes.

### Obligations on Information Furnishers

Businesses and entities that furnish information to CRAs include lenders, creditors, and any other entity that provides information about consumers. These furnishers have specific duties under the FCRA:

- **Accuracy**: Furnishers must provide complete and accurate information to CRAs.
- **Investigation of Disputes**: When consumers dispute information, furnishers must investigate the dispute, review all relevant information provided by the CRA, and report the results to the CRA.

### Obligations on Users of Consumer Reports

Parties that use consumer reports must comply with certain responsibilities:

- **Permissible Purpose**: Users must have a permissible purpose for obtaining a consumer report, such as for [credit](../c/credit.md), employment, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), or tenancy.
- **Adverse Action Notices**: If an adverse action is taken based on information in a consumer report, the user must notify the consumer and provide specific information about the CRA used in making the decision.
- **Written Permission for Employment**: Employers must obtain written consent from job applicants or employees before accessing their [credit](../c/credit.md) reports.

## Enforcement and Penalties

The FCRA is enforced by several [federal agencies](../f/federal_agencies.md), including the Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FTC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and state attorneys general. Violations of the FCRA can result in both civil and criminal penalties:

- **Civil Penalties**: Consumers can file lawsuits against CRAs or furnishers that violate their rights under the FCRA. Courts can award actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees in cases of willful noncompliance.
- **Criminal Penalties**: Knowing and willful violations of the FCRA’s provisions can lead to criminal charges, including fines and imprisonment.

## Amendments and Updates

The FCRA has undergone several amendments to address new challenges in the [credit](../c/credit.md) reporting landscape:

- **FACT Act (Fair and Accurate [Credit](../c/credit.md) Transactions Act) of 2003**: Introduced measures to combat [identity theft](../i/identity_theft.md), allowed consumers to place [fraud](../f/fraud.md) alerts on their [credit](../c/credit.md) reports, established the right to obtain a free annual [credit report](../c/credit_report.md), and included provisions for the disposal of consumer report information.
- **[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) of 2010**: Enhanced the powers of the CFPB to enforce FCRA provisions and ensured greater oversight of the [credit](../c/credit.md) reporting [industry](../i/industry.md).
- **[Economic Growth](../e/economic_growth.md), Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018**: Introduced provisions to assist consumers in managing their [credit](../c/credit.md) information, including free [credit](../c/credit.md) freezes, year-long [fraud](../f/fraud.md) alerts, and enhanced protections for veterans and individuals affected by natural disasters.

## Notable Cases and Litigation

Several notable cases have shaped the interpretation and enforcement of the FCRA. These cases highlight the critical role of the judiciary in upholding consumer rights.

- **Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins (2016)**: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs must demonstrate a concrete and particularized injury resulting from an alleged FCRA violation to have standing in federal court.
- **Safeco [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Co. of America v. Burr (2007)**: The Supreme Court held that a company does not willfully violate the FCRA if it acts based on an objectively reasonable interpretation of the law.

## Consumer Tips for Effective Use of FCRA Rights

Consumers can take several proactive measures to utilize their FCRA rights effectively:

1. **Regularly Review [Credit](../c/credit.md) Reports**: Obtain and review [credit](../c/credit.md) reports from each of the three major CRAs annually to ensure the information is accurate.
2. **Dispute Inaccuracies Promptly**: If inaccuracies are found, promptly dispute them with the CRA and the information furnisher, providing all relevant documentation.
3. **Understand Rights and Notifications**: Pay close attention to any adverse action notices received from creditors, insurers, or employers, and know your rights to challenge the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) information.
4. **Use [Fraud](../f/fraud.md) Alerts and Freezes**: Use [fraud](../f/fraud.md) alerts and [credit](../c/credit.md) freezes to protect against [identity theft](../i/identity_theft.md) and unauthorized access to [credit](../c/credit.md) information.
