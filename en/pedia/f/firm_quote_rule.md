# Firm Quote Rule

The firm quote rule requires market makers to honor their published quotes up to a stated size. It aims to ensure that displayed prices are reliable and executable, which supports fair and orderly markets.

## Key points
- Quotes must be firm for at least the minimum size set by regulation or exchange rules.
- A market maker cannot refuse to trade at its own quoted price within that size.
- The rule applies to both bid and ask quotes.

## Purpose
Firm quotes reduce the risk of bait and switch behavior and improve confidence in displayed liquidity. They also encourage competition among liquidity providers.

## Exceptions and limits
Market makers may adjust or cancel quotes based on changing conditions, but they must honor quotes that are already displayed. Very large orders can exceed the protected size and may receive a different price.

## Example
A market maker posts a bid for 500 shares at 25.10. A buyer sends a marketable order for 200 shares. The market maker must execute the order at 25.10 because the size is within the firm quote limit.

## Operational impact
The rule is implemented through automated quote checks and compliance monitoring by exchanges and regulators.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Firm Quote Rule and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Firm Quote Rule as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Firm Quote Rule, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Firm Quote Rule. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Firm Quote Rule alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
