# Fractional Reserve Banking

## Introduction to Fractional Reserve Banking

Fractional reserve banking is a monetary system in which only a fraction of [bank deposits](../b/bank_deposits.md) are backed by actual cash on hand and available for [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md). This system allows commercial banks to create [money](../m/money.md) through issuing loans by only holding a fraction of the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [deposit](../d/deposit.md) liabilities as reserves. The process is fundamental to modern banking and plays a crucial role in determining the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) within an [economy](../e/economy.md).

## The Mechanics of Fractional Reserve Banking

Under a fractional reserve banking system, banks are required to keep a certain percentage of depositors' [money](../m/money.md) in reserve, meaning they cannot lend out all the [money](../m/money.md) that people [deposit](../d/deposit.md). This reserve requirement is set by the central [bank](../b/bank.md), for instance, the Federal Reserve in the United States.

### Reserve Requirements

The reserve requirement is a regulation that dictates the minimum amount of reserves a [bank](../b/bank.md) must [hold](../h/hold.md) against deposits. For example, if the reserve requirement is 10%, and a [bank](../b/bank.md) has $1,000,000 in deposits, it must [hold](../h/hold.md) $100,000 in reserve and can lend out $900,000. These reserves are generally held in the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s vault or deposited with the central [bank](../b/bank.md).

### Money Creation Process

When a [bank](../b/bank.md) issues a [loan](../l/loan.md), this creates new deposits in the banking system. Suppose a [customer](../c/customer.md) deposits $1,000 in [Bank](../b/bank.md) A. With a 10% reserve requirement, [Bank](../b/bank.md) A needs to keep $100 in reserve but can lend out $900. If [Bank](../b/bank.md) A lends $900 to another [customer](../c/customer.md), and that [customer](../c/customer.md) deposits the [money](../m/money.md) into [Bank](../b/bank.md) B, [Bank](../b/bank.md) B now has $900 in new deposits. [Bank](../b/bank.md) B, also adhering to the same reserve requirement, keeps 10% ($90) in reserves and lends out $810. This process continues with each subsequent [bank](../b/bank.md) receiving smaller and smaller deposits, creating a [multiplier effect](../m/multiplier_effect.md) where the initial [deposit](../d/deposit.md) leads to a much larger increase in the total [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).

### The Money Multiplier

The [money](../m/money.md) [multiplier](../m/multiplier.md) is a formula that quantifies the amount of [money](../m/money.md) created in the banking system from an initial [deposit](../d/deposit.md). It is calculated as:

\[
\text{[Money](../m/money.md) [Multiplier](../m/multiplier.md)} = \frac{1}{\text{Reserve Requirement Ratio}}
\]

If the reserve requirement ratio is 10%, the [money](../m/money.md) [multiplier](../m/multiplier.md) would be 10. This means that an initial [deposit](../d/deposit.md) of $1,000 can theoretically lead to a maximum creation of $10,000 in the banking system, assuming all the [money](../m/money.md) keeps circulating within the system and banks fully utilize their lending capacity.

## Advantages of Fractional Reserve Banking

Fractional reserve banking provides several benefits that help support [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and stability.

### Increased Lending Capacity

By only holding a fraction of deposits in reserve, banks can lend out a significant portion of deposits, increasing the overall lending capacity of the banking system. This supports businesses and consumers in obtaining loans for investment, consumption, and other purposes, which drives economic activity.

### Efficient Allocation of Resources

The banking system can allocate resources more efficiently by lending to projects and businesses that are most likely to generate returns. This contributes to a more productive allocation of [capital](../c/capital.md) within the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Economic Growth

By enabling more lending and spending, fractional reserve banking supports higher levels of [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). The ability to create [money](../m/money.md) through lending activities can stimulate investment and consumption, leading to greater economic output.

## Risks and Challenges

Despite its advantages, fractional reserve banking carries risks and challenges that must be managed carefully.

### Bank Runs

A major [risk](../r/risk.md) in the fractional reserve banking system is the possibility of [bank](../b/bank.md) runs. A [bank run](../b/bank_run.md) occurs when a large number of depositors simultaneously decide to withdraw their [money](../m/money.md) from a [bank](../b/bank.md) due to concerns about the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [solvency](../s/solvency.md). Because banks [hold](../h/hold.md) only a fraction of deposits in reserve, they may quickly run out of cash to meet [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) demands, potentially leading to a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s collapse. This was a common occurrence during the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) before the establishment of modern regulatory frameworks and [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) schemes.

### Liquidity Crisis

Banks may face [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) crises if they are unable to meet short-term [obligations](../o/obligation.md) due to insufficient reserves. This can happen if a [bank](../b/bank.md)’s assets, such as loans and investments, are not easily convertible to cash, or if there is a sudden and unexpected [demand](../d/demand.md) for withdrawals.

### Moral Hazard

Fractional reserve banking can create a [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md) where banks engage in risky lending and investment practices under the assumption that they [will](../w/will.md) be bailed out by the central [bank](../b/bank.md) or government if things go wrong. This can lead to excessive [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking and financial instability.

### Inflation Control

Since fractional reserve banking enables the creation of [money](../m/money.md), it has the potential to contribute to [inflation](../i/inflation.md) if the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) grows too rapidly relative to economic output. Central banks must carefully monitor and manage [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md) and [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) to prevent runaway [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

## Central Bank's Role

Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, play a crucial role in overseeing and regulating the fractional reserve banking system. They implement monetary policies and regulatory measures to ensure the stability and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of the banking system.

### Setting Reserve Requirements

Central banks determine the [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md) that banks must adhere to. By adjusting these requirements, central banks can influence the amount of [money](../m/money.md) that banks can lend, thereby controlling the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and influencing economic activity.

### Lender of Last Resort

In times of [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md), central banks act as lenders of last resort, providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to banks facing short-term funding pressures. This helps prevent [bank](../b/bank.md) runs and maintains confidence in the banking system.

### Open Market Operations

Central banks conduct [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md), buying and selling government securities to influence the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. By purchasing securities, they inject [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) into the banking system, while selling securities withdraws [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), helping to control [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and support [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Historical Perspective

Fractional reserve banking has a long history, dating back to the goldsmiths of the 17th century who issued [receipts](../r/receipt.md) for gold deposited with them. These [receipts](../r/receipt.md) came to be used as a form of [money](../m/money.md). Over time, goldsmiths realized they could [issue](../i/issue.md) more [receipts](../r/receipt.md) than the gold they held, as not all depositors would [demand](../d/demand.md) their gold at the same time. This practice evolved into the modern fractional reserve banking system.

### The Gold Standard

Under the [gold standard](../g/gold_standard.md), the [value](../v/value.md) of a country’s [currency](../c/currency.md) was directly tied to a specific amount of gold. Banks were required to [hold](../h/hold.md) gold reserves equal to a portion of their [deposit](../d/deposit.md) liabilities. Although the [gold standard](../g/gold_standard.md) limited the amount of [money](../m/money.md) banks could create, it provided stability and ensured that [money](../m/money.md) had [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).

### Transition to Fiat Money

The [gold standard](../g/gold_standard.md) was eventually abandoned in favor of [fiat money](../f/fiat_money.md), which is [currency](../c/currency.md) that has no [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) and is not backed by physical commodities but is established as [legal tender](../l/legal_tender.md) by government regulation. This transition allowed for greater flexibility in [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and the [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) to meet the changing needs of the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Modern Banking System

Today’s banking system relies heavily on electronic balances and digital transactions. The principles of fractional reserve banking remain the same, but the mechanisms have evolved with technology and regulatory advancements. Central banks continue to play an essential role in maintaining the stability and integrity of the system.

## Contemporary Examples

Several contemporary developments illustrate the functioning and impact of fractional reserve banking.

### The Global Financial Crisis of 2008

The global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2008 highlighted the vulnerabilities of the fractional reserve banking system. The collapse of major financial institutions due to excessive [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking and lack of sufficient reserves triggered a cascade of [bank](../b/bank.md) failures and required massive intervention by central banks and governments to stabilize the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

### Digital Banking and Fintech

The rise of digital banking and financial technology (fintech) companies is reshaping the fractional reserve banking landscape. Digital platforms allow for more efficient and accessible banking services, facilitating loans, savings, and investments. Fintech innovations, such as [peer-to-peer lending](../p/peer-to-peer_lending.md), are challenging traditional banking models but still operate within the principles of fractional reserve banking.

### Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)

Central banks are exploring the development of digital currencies (CBDCs) to address the evolving financial ecosystem. CBDCs could enhance the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of monetary transactions and potentially provide central banks with more direct control over the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md). However, the implications for the fractional reserve banking system are still being studied and debated.

## Regulatory Framework and Safeguards

To mitigate the risks associated with fractional reserve banking, several regulatory frameworks and safeguards are in place.

### Deposit Insurance

[Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) schemes, such as the Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FDIC) in the United States, protect depositors by insuring their deposits up to a certain amount. This reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [bank](../b/bank.md) runs by ensuring that depositors [will](../w/will.md) not lose their [money](../m/money.md) even if a [bank](../b/bank.md) fails.

### Capital Requirements

Banks are required to maintain [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy ratios, which ensure they have sufficient [capital](../c/capital.md) to absorb losses and continue operating during financial stress. [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), an international regulatory framework, sets forth stringent [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements to enhance the resilience of the banking system.

### Prudential Regulation

Regulatory bodies conduct regular supervision and monitoring of banks to ensure they adhere to sound banking practices and maintain financial stability. This includes evaluating the quality of assets, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) management, and [risk](../r/risk.md) governance.

## Conclusion

Fractional reserve banking is fundamental to the modern [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), enabling increased lending capacity, efficient allocation of resources, and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). However, it also carries inherent risks that necessitate careful regulation and oversight. Central banks play a critical role in maintaining the stability and integrity of the system through various tools and policies. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, innovations such as digital banking and CBDCs may reshape the principles and practices of fractional reserve banking, demanding ongoing adaptation and vigilance from regulators and financial institutions.
