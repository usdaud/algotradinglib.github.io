# Financial Inclusion

## Definition and Importance of Financial Inclusion

**Financial inclusion** refers to the process of ensuring access to appropriate financial products and services needed by individuals and businesses at affordable costs in a fair and transparent manner. It plays a crucial role in economic development by enabling more inclusive growth, reducing [poverty](../p/poverty.md), and fostering broader opportunities for economic participation and growth. Financial inclusion aims to provide essential financial services such as savings accounts, [credit](../c/credit.md), [insurance](../i/insurance.md), payments, and remittances to the [underbanked](../u/underbanked.md) and [unbanked](../u/unbanked.md) populations.

Financial inclusion is critical because it empowers individuals, especially those in low-[income](../i/income.md) groups, by connecting them to broader economic activities and financial systems. It helps to build financial resilience among households and SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises), allowing them to manage risks, save for future investments, and cope with economic shocks more effectively.

 - **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Facilities**: Provide the means to borrow [money](../m/money.md) for personal or [business](../b/business.md) needs.
 - **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md)**: Helps manage risks and provides a safety net against unforeseen events.
 - **Payments and Remittances**: Facilitate [money](../m/money.md) transfers and [payment](../p/payment.md) for goods and services.
