# Futures Expiration

Futures expiration is the point when a contract stops trading and is settled or delivered. It defines the final trading day, settlement time, and any delivery obligations.

## Key dates
- Last trading day: final day the contract can be traded.
- Expiration date: when the contract ceases to exist.
- Delivery period: for physical contracts, the window for delivery.

## Cash vs physical settlement
Cash settled contracts use a reference price to compute final profit and loss. Physically settled contracts require delivery of the underlying asset or a transfer through approved facilities.

## Example
An equity index future is cash settled to a final settlement price. A commodity future may require delivery unless the trader closes or rolls before the delivery period.

## Practical notes
Volume and liquidity often shift to the next contract before expiration. Traders typically roll positions to avoid delivery and to maintain exposure.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Futures Expiration and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Futures Expiration as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Futures Expiration, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Futures Expiration. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Futures Expiration alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
