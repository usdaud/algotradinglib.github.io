# Fat Finger Error

A fat finger error is a trading mistake caused by incorrect input of order details. It usually involves the wrong size, price, or side due to typing or interface errors. These errors can create large unintended positions and can move the market if the order is large enough.

## Typical causes
- Extra zeros in quantity or price.
- Confusing buy and sell buttons.
- Using the wrong account or symbol.
- Copy and paste errors across multiple order tickets.

## Impact
A fat finger trade can cause sudden price spikes, trigger other orders, and force rapid liquidation. Exchanges may bust or adjust trades in extreme cases, but this is not guaranteed.

## Prevention controls
- Order size limits and price collars.
- Confirmation dialogs for large orders.
- Pre trade risk checks at brokers.
- Kill switches and automated cancel tools.

## Example
A trader intends to buy 10,000 shares at 25.10 but submits 100,000 shares at 251.00. The order sweeps the book and creates a sharp jump. The trader must quickly unwind at a loss if the trade is not canceled.

## Operational lessons
Fat finger errors are operational risks, not market risks. Good process design and automation reduce the chance of a single keystroke causing a large loss.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Fat Finger Error and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Fat Finger Error as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Fat Finger Error, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Fat Finger Error. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Fat Finger Error alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
