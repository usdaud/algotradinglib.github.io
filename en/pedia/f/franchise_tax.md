# Franchise Tax

## Definition

A [franchise](../f/franchise.md) tax is a levy placed by state governments on businesses or corporations for the privilege of either incorporating or doing [business](../b/business.md) within that particular state. Unlike [income tax](../i/income_tax.md), the [franchise](../f/franchise.md) tax is not based on a company's [profit](../p/profit.md), but rather on its [net worth](../n/net_worth.md) or [capital](../c/capital.md) held. Essentially, it is a charge companies must pay for the legal right to exist as businesses within certain jurisdictions.

### Historical Background

The concept of [franchise](../f/franchise.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Originally, they were instituted as a way to regulate and extract revenues from businesses benefiting from [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) and other legal protections provided by state governments. Over time, the number and types of entities subject to [franchise](../f/franchise.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) have evolved, reflecting changes in the [business](../b/business.md) landscape and state fiscal needs.

### Purposes and Justifications

1. **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Generation:** [Franchise](../f/franchise.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) provide significant [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams for state budgets, enabling them to [fund](../f/fund.md) public services and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).
2. **Regulatory Mechanism:** They serve as a tool for states to oversee the entities operating within their jurisdictions.
3. **Level Playing Field:** By taxing businesses for the right to operate, states aim to create an equitable environment where all entities contribute to the community.

## Rates

[Franchise](../f/franchise.md) tax rates vary significantly from state to state and can be determined through different methodologies. The most common bases for calculating these [taxes](../t/taxes.md) include:

### **Net Worth Method**

1. **Definition:** Calculated based on a company's [net worth](../n/net_worth.md) or the [value](../v/value.md) of its assets minus its liabilities.
2. **Example States:** Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina.
3. **Rates:** Typically [range](../r/range.md) from 0.1% to 0.75%, but specifics can vary.

### **Capital Stock Method**

1. **Definition:** Based on the [value](../v/value.md) of the company's issued [capital stock](../c/capital_stock.md) and [surplus](../s/surplus.md).
2. **Example States:** Delaware, Mississippi.
3. **Rates:** Often a flat [fee](../f/fee.md) based on bracketed amounts of [capital stock](../c/capital_stock.md) [value](../v/value.md).

### **Gross Receipts Method**

1. **Definition:** Calculated as a percentage of the company's gross [revenue](../r/revenue.md).
2. **Example States:** Ohio, Washington.
3. **Rates:** Usually around 0.26% to 1%.

### **Flat Fee Method**

1. **Definition:** A fixed annual [fee](../f/fee.md) regardless of [business](../b/business.md) size or [revenue](../r/revenue.md).
2. **Example States:** Arkansas, Nevada.
3. **Rates:** Commonly between $150 and $500 annually.

## Exemptions

While [franchise](../f/franchise.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are broadly applicable, certain types of businesses or entities can qualify for exemptions. Typical exemptions include:

### **Non-Profit Organizations**

1. **Description:** Charitable, religious, or educational entities often receive exemptions due to their public service nature.
2. **Example:** A charitable organization dedicated to environmental conservation might be exempt from [franchise](../f/franchise.md) tax.

### **Small Businesses**

1. **Description:** Some states [offer](../o/offer.md) exemptions or reduced rates for businesses below specific [revenue](../r/revenue.md) or [net worth](../n/net_worth.md) thresholds.
2. **Example:** A [startup](../s/startup.md) with [gross receipts](../g/gross_receipts.md) under $1 million might qualify for an [exemption](../e/exemption.md) or reduced rate in some states.

### **Agricultural Entities**

1. **Description:** Entities primarily involved in farming or agriculture might also be eligible for exemptions given their critical role in food production.
2. **Example:** A family farm producing organic vegetables may be exempt from [franchise](../f/franchise.md) tax in agricultural-centric states.

### **State-Specific Exemptions**

Each state can have unique [exemption](../e/exemption.md) categories based on local legislative priorities.

1. **Description:** Special exemptions can be created to boost specific industries or economic activities within a state.
2. **Example:** Texas offers an [exemption](../e/exemption.md) for businesses involved in solar energy production.

## Example

Let's consider a practical example to demonstrate how [franchise](../f/franchise.md) tax might be calculated and applied.

### **Scenario:**

- A [business](../b/business.md) incorporated in Delaware has a [capital stock](../c/capital_stock.md) [value](../v/value.md) of $10 million.

### **Franchise Tax Calculation in Delaware:**

1. **Base [Fee](../f/fee.md):** Delaware applies a [progressive tax](../p/progressive_tax.md) rate based on the [value](../v/value.md) of [capital stock](../c/capital_stock.md).
2. **Initial Bracket:** For the first $1 million of [capital stock](../c/capital_stock.md), they charge a flat [fee](../f/fee.md) of $175.
3. **Additional Brackets:** For [capital stock](../c/capital_stock.md) over $1 million, Delaware charges $250 per million-dollar bracket.

### **Steps:**

1. **Flat [Fee](../f/fee.md) for First Bracket:** $175
2. **Additional Brackets:** 9 (since $10 million - $1 million base)
3. **Additional Fees:** 9 * $250 = $2,250
4. **Total [Franchise](../f/franchise.md) Tax:** $175 + $2,250 = $2,425

Thus, a [business](../b/business.md) incorporated in Delaware with a [capital stock](../c/capital_stock.md) [value](../v/value.md) of $10 million would owe a [franchise](../f/franchise.md) tax of $2,425 annually.
