# First In, First Out (FIFO)

First In, First Out, commonly abbreviated as FIFO, is an [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) and [accounting method](../a/accounting_method.md) that assumes that the first items added to [inventory](../i/inventory.md) are the first ones to be used or sold. In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), FIFO can refer to the [order](../o/order.md) in which trades or instructions are executed. FIFO is foundational in various industries ranging from [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) and retail to [finance](../f/finance.md). The FIFO method contrasts with Last In, First Out (LIFO) and Average Cost methods, [offering](../o/offering.md) its unique benefits and application scenarios.

## Core Concepts

### Inventory Management

FIFO's primary [utility](../u/utility.md) in [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) is straightforward: it helps businesses manage and minimize the cost of [inventory](../i/inventory.md) by ensuring that older stock is sold before it becomes obsolete or perishes. This is particularly crucial for industries dealing with perishable goods, such as food and beverages or pharmaceuticals.

- **[Inventory Turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md)**: FIFO facilitates a higher [inventory turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) rate, which means that products spend less time on the shelves. This is beneficial for businesses aiming to keep [inventory](../i/inventory.md) fresh and up-to-date.
- **Cost Tracking**: Under FIFO, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is based on the oldest [inventory](../i/inventory.md) costs. As a result, the ending [inventory](../i/inventory.md) reflects the cost of the most recent purchases.

### Accounting

In [financial accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md), FIFO affects the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and tax calculations. During periods of [inflation](../i/inflation.md), FIFO results in lower COGS compared to LIFO, leading to higher [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) and vice versa during [deflation](../d/deflation.md).

- **[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md)**: FIFO can result in higher net [income](../i/income.md) in times of rising prices because older, cheaper costs are matched against current revenues.
- **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md)**: Ending [inventory](../i/inventory.md) values are higher under FIFO during inflationary periods since they reflect the cost of the most recent acquisitions.
  
### Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), FIFO refers to the [order](../o/order.md) in which trades are executed. This ensures that the earliest trades are completed first, which can be crucial for maintaining the sequence logic of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

- **[Order](../o/order.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Maintaining FIFO [order](../o/order.md) can be vital for implementing certain [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), preventing [order](../o/order.md) mishandling or discrepancies.
- **Latency Considerations**: In high-frequency trading (HFT), minimizing the latency and ensuring the correct sequence of [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) is essential to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) opportunities.

## Applications of FIFO

### Manufacturing

In [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), FIFO is used to manage [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels efficiently, ensuring the oldest [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) are used first. This not only prevents spoilage or obsolescence but also helps in maintaining product quality.

- **Production Workflow**: FIFO can be integrated into the production workflow, ensuring materials flow smoothly through various stages of [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md).
- **[Quality Control](../q/quality_control.md)**: Consistent use of FIFO helps maintain the quality of the final product by using the oldest [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) first, thus reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of shelf-life issues.

### Retail

FIFO is particularly useful in retail to manage stock and ensure older items are sold first. This is especially important in fashion and electronics where products have a limited shelf life due to rapid [market](../m/market.md) changes.

- **Shelf Management**: Retail stores often implement FIFO by rotating stock, placing older items at the front and newer items at the back.
  
### Finance and Taxation

For [finance](../f/finance.md) professionals and accountants, FIFO is a key method for managing the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [inventory](../i/inventory.md) and calculating the cost of goods sold.

- **Tax Implications**: Since FIFO results in higher [income](../i/income.md) during periods of [inflation](../i/inflation.md), it can lead to higher tax liabilities. Companies need to weigh the benefits of higher paper profits against the tax implications.
  
### Order Management Systems

FIFO principles are embedded in many [Order Management Systems](../o/order_management_systems.md) (OMS) used in various industries, including [finance](../f/finance.md) and e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md). These systems automate the process of maintaining [order](../o/order.md) sequences according to FIFO rules.

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Processing**: In financial trading, OMS integrating FIFO ensure that [trade](../t/trade.md) instructions are processed in the [order](../o/order.md) they are received.
  
## Advantages of FIFO

### Simplicity and Transparency

One of the primary advantages of FIFO is its simplicity and ease of implementation. It provides a transparent method for tracking [inventory](../i/inventory.md) and managing costs.

- **Ease of Implementation**: FIFO is easy to implement across various systems and [business](../b/business.md) processes, making it a preferred choice for many businesses.
- **Transparent Reporting**: FIFO offers clear and straightforward financial reporting, which is helpful for stakeholders and regulatory compliance.

### True Representation of Costs

FIFO often provides a more accurate representation of actual [inventory](../i/inventory.md) costs, especially in industries with fluctuating prices. This is because the costs reported in the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) closely match the actual prices paid for the [inventory](../i/inventory.md).

### Improved Cash Flow

By using older [inventory](../i/inventory.md) first, companies can free up cash tied up in stock, which can then be reinvested or used for other operational needs.

### Regulatory Compliance

In various regions, FIFO aligns well with Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), making it easier for companies to meet regulatory requirements.

## Disadvantages of FIFO

### Tax Impact

One significant disadvantage of FIFO in an inflationary environment is that it can lead to higher [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), resulting in greater tax liabilities.

### Operational Complexity

While FIFO is conceptually simple, implementing it in large-scale operations can become complex. For example, keeping track of the age of [inventory](../i/inventory.md) items can require sophisticated [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) systems.

### Not Always Reflective of Market Prices

During periods of significant price fluctuations, FIFO might not always provide a true reflection of current [market](../m/market.md) prices, potentially distorting [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md).

## Real-World Case Studies

### Amazon

Amazon utilizes FIFO for its vast [inventory](../i/inventory.md) across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) warehouses worldwide. The e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) giant ensures that older [inventory](../i/inventory.md) items are shipped out first, minimizing storage time and maintaining product freshness.

- **Automated [Inventory](../i/inventory.md) Systems**: Amazon's automated [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) systems are designed to keep track of the age of each item, ensuring FIFO is adhered to at scale.

### Walmart

Walmart employs FIFO to manage its extensive [range](../r/range.md) of perishable goods, ensuring that products such as food and pharmaceuticals are used or sold before they expire.

- **[Inventory Turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md)**: By implementing FIFO, Walmart achieves high [inventory turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) rates, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of spoilage and maintaining product quality.

## Implementing FIFO

### Manual Systems

In smaller operations, FIFO can be implemented manually through regular stock rotation and diligent record-keeping.

- **Stock Rotation**: Workers physically rotate stock to ensure older items are at the front, and newer items are placed at the back.
- **Record Keeping**: Maintaining accurate [inventory](../i/inventory.md) records helps track which items were added first and need to be used or sold first.

### Automated Systems

For larger operations, implementing FIFO requires automated systems that can [handle](../h/handle.md) the complexity and [volume](../v/volume.md) of [inventory](../i/inventory.md).

- **[Inventory Management](../i/inventory_management.md) Software**: [Robust](../r/robust.md) software solutions automate the tracking and management of [inventory](../i/inventory.md), ensuring FIFO is adhered to.
- **Barcode Systems**: Using barcodes to track [inventory](../i/inventory.md) items simplifies the process of maintaining FIFO, reducing manual effort and errors.

### Integration with OMS

[Order Management Systems](../o/order_management_systems.md) can integrate FIFO principles to manage the sequence of [order](../o/order.md) fulfillment, ensuring that orders are processed in the [order](../o/order.md) they are received.

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) [Order](../o/order.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: In financial trading, OMS using FIFO ensure that the earliest [trade](../t/trade.md) orders are executed first, maintaining fairness and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md).

### Regulatory Compliance

Implementing FIFO requires adherence to financial reporting and regulatory standards, necessitating regular audits and documentation.

- **Compliance Audits**: Regular audits ensure that FIFO is correctly implemented and adhered to, meeting regulatory requirements and providing accurate financial reporting.
