# Force Index (FI)

The force index is a momentum indicator that combines price change and volume. It is designed to measure the strength of buying or selling pressure behind a move.

## Formula
Force Index = (Close today - Close yesterday) * Volume today

Many traders smooth the raw value with an exponential moving average to reduce noise. Common settings are 2, 13, or 21 periods depending on the timeframe.

## Interpretation
- Positive values suggest buying pressure.
- Negative values suggest selling pressure.
- Rising values with rising price can confirm a trend.
- Divergence between price and force index can warn of a weakening move.

## Example
Price makes a new high but the force index is lower than at the prior high. This divergence can hint that the up move is losing strength.

## Practical notes
The force index works best with trend context and is often combined with moving averages or support and resistance levels.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Force Index (FI) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Force Index (FI) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Force Index (FI), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Force Index (FI). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Force Index (FI) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
