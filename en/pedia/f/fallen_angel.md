# Fallen Angel

A "fallen angel" is a term used in [finance](../f/finance.md) to describe a [bond](../b/bond.md) that was originally issued with an investment-grade [rating](../r/rating.md) but has since been downgraded to a [junk bond](../j/junk_bond.md). This downgrade typically occurs because of a decline in the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md), often due to deteriorating [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) or adverse [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). Fallen angels are of particular [interest](../i/interest.md) to many investors because they may present opportunities for higher returns, albeit with increased [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Characteristics of Fallen Angels

### Credit Rating
Initially, fallen angels possess an investment-grade [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) from major [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies like Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch. However, after experiencing financial troubles, their [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings drop below the investment-grade threshold, generally below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's.

### Issuer's Financial Health
The [issuer](../i/issuer.md) of a fallen angel [bond](../b/bond.md) often encounters financial difficulties such as declining [revenue](../r/revenue.md), increasing [debt](../d/debt.md), or operational inefficiencies. These financial challenges cause [rating](../r/rating.md) agencies to reevaluate the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), leading to a downgrade.

### Higher Yields
Fallen angels typically [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields compared to bonds that maintain their investment-grade status. This is because investors [demand](../d/demand.md) higher compensation for the increased [risk](../r/risk.md) of potential [default](../d/default.md) associated with lower-rated bonds.

### Market Perception
Upon being downgraded to junk status, the [market](../m/market.md) perception of a fallen angel changes dramatically. Investors who can only [hold](../h/hold.md) investment-grade securities are often forced to sell these bonds, which can lead to a sharp decline in their [market](../m/market.md) prices. This sell-off might provide opportunities for other investors who specialize in distressed assets.

## Causes of Downgrade

Several factors can lead to a [bond](../b/bond.md) being downgraded to fallen angel status:

### Economic Conditions
Adverse macroeconomic conditions can significantly impact the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and profitability of a company. For instance, a [recession](../r/recession.md) can reduce consumer spending, causing [revenue](../r/revenue.md) declines and financial strain.

### Industry-specific Issues
Problems within a specific [industry](../i/industry.md) can affect [multiple](../m/multiple.md) companies. For example, the collapse in oil prices around 2015–2016 resulted in several energy companies experiencing financial difficulties, leading to downgrades of their bonds.

### Poor Management
Ineffective management decisions, such as poor strategic planning or financial mismanagement, can lead to deteriorating [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and subsequent downgrades.

### Leverage and Debt Levels
Companies with high levels of [debt](../d/debt.md) are particularly vulnerable to downgrades. If a company's [debt](../d/debt.md) levels become unsustainable, its [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) is likely to be downgraded.

## Investment Strategies

Investors implement various strategies to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the opportunities presented by fallen angels:

### Contrarian Investing
Contrarian investors look for fallen angels that they believe have been unfairly punished by the [market](../m/market.md). They purchase these bonds at depressed prices, anticipating a recovery in the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and a potential [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) in [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md).

### Distressed Debt Funds
Specialized funds focus on [investing](../i/investing.md) in distressed [debt](../d/debt.md), including fallen angels. These funds employ expertise in evaluating the distressed assets and often engage actively with the management of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to facilitate a [turnaround](../t/turnaround.md).

### Credit Risk Analysis
Sophisticated investors conduct thorough [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk analysis](../r/risk_analysis.md) to differentiate fallen angels with recovery potential from those likely to continue deteriorating. This involves assessing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), [industry](../i/industry.md) conditions, management quality, and other qualitative factors.

## Risks

### Default Risk
The primary [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with fallen angels is [default risk](../d/default_risk.md). If the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)’s financial condition worsens, it may become unable to meet its [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md), leading to [default](../d/default.md).

### Liquidity Risk
Fallen angels may suffer from reduced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), especially after a downgrade, as investors might be unwilling to [trade](../t/trade.md) these lower-rated bonds. This can make it challenging to buy or sell these securities without affecting the [market price](../m/market_price.md).

### Interest Rate Risk
Like all bonds, fallen angels are subject to [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md). Rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can negatively impact [bond](../b/bond.md) prices, including those of fallen angels.

## Notable Fallen Angels

### General Electric (GE)
General Electric, once one of the largest and most successful companies in the world, experienced significant financial troubles in the late 2010s, leading to its bonds being downgraded closer to junk status. The downgrade was due to declining [business](../b/business.md) segments, large [debt](../d/debt.md) burden, and operational challenges.

### Kraft Heinz
Kraft Heinz saw its bonds downgraded to junk status as the company struggled with declining sales and substantial [debt](../d/debt.md). The downgrade reflected the deteriorating financial metrics and challenges in turning around its [business](../b/business.md) operations.

## Recovery Stories

### Delta Air Lines
[Delta](../d/delta.md) Air Lines faced severe financial difficulties and was downgraded to junk status in the early 2000s. However, the airline underwent a successful [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md), improved its [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), and eventually regained its investment-grade [rating](../r/rating.md).

### Ford Motor Company
Ford Motor Company’s bonds were downgraded to junk status during the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2008. The company managed to avoid [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), restructured its operations, improved profitability, and subsequently had its bonds upgraded back to investment-grade status.

## Case Studies

### Enron
Enron was once a high-flying energy company with investment-grade bonds. However, due to [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and unethical [business](../b/business.md) practices, the company collapsed, and its bonds were downgraded to junk status. This case serves as a cautionary tale of how rapidly an investment-grade [bond](../b/bond.md) can turn into a fallen angel.

### Lehman Brothers
[Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) was a prestigious investment [bank](../b/bank.md) whose bonds were rated investment-grade. The collapse of [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) in 2008 due to exposure to subprime mortgages led to a downgrade to junk status and [default](../d/default.md), highlighting the [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) and rapid deterioration that can lead to the fallen angel status.

## Resources for Investors

Investors interested in fallen angels can utilize various resources to stay informed:

### Credit Rating Agencies
Monitoring reports and updates from [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies like Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), and Fitch can provide valuable insights into potential fallen angels.

### Financial News Outlets
Staying updated through financial news websites such as [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), [Reuters](../r/reuters.md), and CNBC can help investors identify companies facing financial difficulties that might lead to downgrades.

### Specialized Research Firms
Research firms specializing in [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) and distressed [debt](../d/debt.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) detailed analysis and recommendations on fallen angels. Examples include:
- Loomis Sayles
- Glass Lewis

### Bond Market Platforms
Platforms like [MarketAxess](../m/marketaxess.md) and Tradeweb provide access to [bond market](../b/bond_market.md) data, including pricing, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and trading information on fallen angels.

## Conclusion

The phenomenon of fallen angels presents both opportunities and risks for investors. While these downgraded bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields, they come with increased [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). Understanding the causes of downgrades and employing strategies such as contrarian [investing](../i/investing.md) or distressed [debt](../d/debt.md) funds can help investors navigate this complex landscape. However, thorough [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk analysis](../r/risk_analysis.md) and awareness of potential risks are crucial in making informed investment decisions in the realm of fallen angels.
