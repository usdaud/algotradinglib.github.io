# First Notice Day (FND)

First notice day is the first day on which a futures contract holder can be assigned a delivery notice. It marks the start of the delivery process for physically settled futures.

## Why it matters
Traders who do not intend to make or take delivery usually close or roll their positions before first notice day. Holding a long position after this date can result in a delivery obligation.

## Delivery timeline
- The exchange publishes the delivery schedule for each contract month.
- First notice day starts the period when delivery can be assigned.
- Last notice day ends the delivery period.

## Example
A trader is long one crude oil futures contract. The contract month reaches first notice day. To avoid delivery, the trader sells the contract and buys the next month, effectively rolling the position.

## Practical notes
- Volume often shifts to the next contract month before first notice day.
- Spread markets become more active as traders roll.
- Some contracts have different notice rules, so the schedule must be checked.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for First Notice Day (FND) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating First Notice Day (FND) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For First Notice Day (FND), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying First Notice Day (FND). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use First Notice Day (FND) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
