# Form 8379

Form 8379, also known as the Injured Spouse Allocation form, is a document used by the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) in the United States. This form is for taxpayers who file a [joint](../j/joint.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) and want to reclaim their portion of a refund that was used to [offset](../o/offset.md) their spouse's past-due debts. These debts can include federal tax, state [income tax](../i/income_tax.md), state [unemployment compensation](../u/unemployment_compensation.md) debts, child or spousal support payments, and other federal nontax debts such as student loans.

## Importance of Form 8379

When a [joint](../j/joint.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) is filed, the IRS considers it a single entity. Therefore, if one spouse has past-due [obligations](../o/obligation.md), the entire [tax refund](../t/tax_refund.md) can be applied to these debts, leaving the other spouse's portion of the refund at [risk](../r/risk.md). Form 8379 protects the "injured" spouse's share of the refund by calculating what portion of the refund belongs to them.

## Filing Requirements

To be eligible to file Form 8379, the following conditions must be met:
1. You are not legally obligated to pay the past-due amount.
2. You have reported [income](../i/income.md) such as wages, taxable [interest](../i/interest.md), etc., on the [joint](../j/joint.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).
3. You have made and reported tax payments, such as [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax [withholding](../w/withholding.md) or estimated tax payments.
4. You are seeking a refund of your share of the overpayment shown on the [joint](../j/joint.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

## How to File Form 8379

You can file Form 8379 in two ways:
1. **With a [joint](../j/joint.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) (e-file or paper):** Attach Form 8379 to your original Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. Be sure to write "Injured Spouse" in the upper left corner of the 1040 form before sending it through.
2. **By itself after the initial filing:** If the [joint return](../j/joint_return.md) has already been filed and processed, Form 8379 can be sent separately. Make sure you include the information about the original [joint](../j/joint.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) filing.

When completing Form 8379, you [will](../w/will.md) need to provide details about:
- Allocation of [income](../i/income.md) and deductions between spouses.
- Allocation of credits and payments made.

## Processing Time

The IRS indicates that it generally takes about 11 weeks to process Form 8379 when it is filed electronically, and about 14 weeks if filed by paper. If you filed Form 8379 with your original [joint](../j/joint.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), processing can be delayed if there are errors on the [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

## Examples of Past-Due Debt

Some common debts that would trigger the need for Form 8379 include:
- **Child and Spousal Support:** If your spouse is behind on child support payments, the IRS may use the refund to cover these arrears.
- **Student Loans:** Defaulted federal student loans can also lead to offsets from a [joint](../j/joint.md) refund.
- **Federal [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** Unpaid [taxes](../t/taxes.md) may result in the IRS seizing the refund.
- **State [Income](../i/income.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** Similar to federal [taxes](../t/taxes.md), unpaid state [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can prompt the state to claim part or all of the refund.

## Limitations and Considerations

While filing Form 8379 can help reclaim the portion of your refund that was unfairly taken, there are certain limitations and considerations to be aware of:
- **Non-Eligible Debts:** The form does not protect against debts that you are also liable for.
- **Filing Deadlines:** It is advisable to file the form as soon as possible to avoid delaying the processing of your refund.
- **Amending Returns:** If you need to amend your [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) (using [Form 1040X](../f/form_1040x.md)), you can still claim injured spouse relief.
- **Complex Allocations:** In cases where finances and debts are complex, seeking advice from a tax professional may be beneficial.
