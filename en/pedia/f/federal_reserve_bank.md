# Federal Reserve Bank

The Federal Reserve [Bank](../b/bank.md), often referred to as the "Fed," is the central [bank](../b/bank.md) of the United States. It was established in 1913 through the Federal Reserve Act, which aimed to provide the country with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). The Federal Reserve System includes 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities across the nation, and the [Board of Governors](../b/board_of_governors.md) in Washington, D.C. This institution plays a crucial role in the functioning of the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md), influencing [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), supervising and regulating banking institutions, maintaining financial stability, and providing banking services.

## Structure and Organization

### The Board of Governors

The [Board of Governors](../b/board_of_governors.md) is the central component of the Federal Reserve System, consisting of seven members appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The Board plays a key role in shaping [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and regulatory guidelines.

### Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)

The FOMC is responsible for overseeing the country's [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md), which involve the buying and selling of government securities. The committee is composed of the seven members of the [Board of Governors](../b/board_of_governors.md) and five of the twelve Reserve [Bank](../b/bank.md) presidents. The FOMC typically meets eight times a year to discuss [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and make decisions regarding [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and the growth of the U.S. [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).

### Regional Federal Reserve Banks

There are 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, each serving a specific geographic area of the U.S. These Banks are responsible for executing the policies of the Federal Reserve System at a regional level. They do this through their participation in the FOMC, as well as by providing banking services to [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions and the federal government.

Here is the list of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks:

1. **Boston** 2. **New York** 3. **Philadelphia** 4. **Cleveland** 5. **Richmond** 6. **Atlanta** 7. **Chicago** 8. **St. Louis** 9. **Minneapolis** 10. **Kansas City** 11. **Dallas** 12. **San Francisco**
Each of these Banks operates independently within the framework of the Federal Reserve System, supervising banking operations and implementing [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) within its region.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Monetary Policy

[Monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) refers to the actions undertaken by the Federal Reserve to influence the availability and cost of [money](../m/money.md) and [credit](../c/credit.md), with the aim of achieving national economic goals. This includes:

- **Controlling [Inflation](../i/inflation.md)**: The Fed targets an [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate, often around 2%, to ensure price stability.
- **Managing Employment**: By adjusting [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, the Fed tries to maintain a balance between maximum sustainable employment and price stability.
- **Moderating Long-term [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Through its policy tools, the Fed influences long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, which impact [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and investment.

### Regulation and Supervision

The Federal Reserve oversees and regulates numerous financial institutions to ensure the soundness and resilience of the U.S. banking system. This includes:

- **Conducting Examinations**: Regularly inspecting banks to ensure they operate in a safe and sound manner and comply with laws and regulations.
- **Enforcing Consumer Protection Laws**: Ensuring that financial institutions comply with consumer protection legislation, such as the Truth in Lending Act.
- **Monitoring [Systemic Risk](../s/systemic_risk.md)**: Identifying and mitigating risks that could impact the stability of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) as a whole.

### Financial Stability

The Federal Reserve acts as a guardian of financial stability in the U.S., addressing systemic risks that could adversely affect the [economy](../e/economy.md). This is done through:

- **[Stress Testing](../s/stress_testing.md)**: Regularly conducting stress tests on large financial institutions to assess their resilience in economic downturns.
- **Macroprudential Policies**: Implementing policies aimed at preventing and mitigating systemic risks, such as [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements and [leverage ratios](../l/leverage_ratios.md).

### Banking Services

The Federal Reserve provides essential banking services to [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions, which include:

- **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Systems**: Operating and overseeing [payment](../p/payment.md) and settlement systems, including Fedwire and ACH, to ensure they function smoothly and efficiently.
- **[Currency](../c/currency.md) [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: Issuing, circulating, and ensuring the quality of U.S. [currency](../c/currency.md) notes.
- **Acting as a Fiscal Agent**: Managing the Treasury Department's accounts, performing various financial services, and executing financial [market](../m/market.md) operations on behalf of the federal government.

## Tools of the Federal Reserve

The Federal Reserve employs several tools to conduct [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and maintain financial stability:

### Open Market Operations (OMO)

The primary tool of the Federal Reserve, OMOs involve the buying and selling of [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) and federal agency securities in the [open market](../o/open_market.md). Through these operations, the Fed influences the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md)—the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions lend balances to each other overnight.

### Discount Rate

The [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) charged by the Federal Reserve Banks for short-term loans to [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions. By adjusting this rate, the Fed can influence the cost of borrowing, thereby affecting economic activity.

### Reserve Requirements

The Fed sets [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md), which are regulations on the minimum amount of reserves that banks must [hold](../h/hold.md) against deposits. By altering these requirements, the Fed can change the amount of funds banks have available to lend.

### Interest on Excess Reserves (IOER)

The Fed pays [interest](../i/interest.md) on the reserves held by commercial banks at the Federal Reserve. By setting the IOER, the Fed can influence the amount of [excess reserves](../e/excess_reserves.md) that banks [hold](../h/hold.md) and thereby control the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md).

### Quantitative Easing (QE) and Tightening (QT)

When conventional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tools reach their limits, the Fed may employ QE by purchasing longer-term securities to inject [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) directly into the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). Conversely, QT involves selling those securities to withdraw [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) from the system.

## Global Impact

The Federal Reserve's policies and actions not only impact the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md) but also have significant global implications. As the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) of the world's primary [reserve currency](../r/reserve_currency.md), the U.S. dollar, the Fed's decisions can influence global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, and international [capital](../c/capital.md) flows. Many countries' monetary authorities closely watch and often respond to Fed policies to stabilize their own economies.

## Historical Context

### Founding

The Federal Reserve was established in response to a series of financial panics, particularly the severe panic of 1907. Before the creation of the Fed, the U.S. banking system lacked a central authority to manage [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and stabilize the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Evolution

Over the years, the Federal Reserve has evolved to meet the changing needs of the [economy](../e/economy.md). Major milestones include:

- **The [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md)**: The Federal Reserve expanded its role in the [economy](../e/economy.md), adopting new tools and policies to combat severe economic downturns.
- **Post-War Period**: The Fed focused on maintaining low [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and stable growth during the mid-20th century.
- **2008 [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md)**: The Fed adopted unconventional monetary policies, such as [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md), to address the fallout from the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

## Criticisms and Controversies

The Federal Reserve has faced various criticisms over the years, including:

- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md) and Accountability**: Critics argue that the Fed lacks sufficient [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability to the public and Congress.
- **Policy Effectiveness**: Some question the effectiveness of the Fed's policies, particularly during economic crises or periods of low [inflation](../i/inflation.md).
- **Independence**: There are ongoing debates about the appropriate level of independence the Fed should have from political influences.

## Conclusion

The Federal Reserve [Bank](../b/bank.md) is a cornerstone of the U.S. [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), playing a vital role in maintaining economic stability and growth. Through its various tools and policies, the Fed influences [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, supervises banks, ensures financial stability, and provides critical banking services. Despite facing criticisms and evolving challenges, the Federal Reserve continues to be a central figure in both the national and global [economy](../e/economy.md).
