# Futures Rollover

Futures rollover is the process of closing a position in an expiring contract month and opening a position in a later month. It allows traders to maintain exposure without taking delivery.

## How it is done
- Sell the expiring contract and buy the next month for long exposure.
- Buy the expiring contract and sell the next month for short exposure.
- Use a calendar spread order to roll in a single transaction.

## Timing
The rollover window varies by market. Many traders roll when liquidity shifts to the next contract, often several days or weeks before expiration or first notice day.

## Example
A trader long the March contract rolls to June by selling March and buying June. The spread price reflects the futures curve and can create a roll gain or loss.

## Practical notes
- Monitor open interest and volume to identify the active contract.
- Spreads can widen during the roll period, so execution matters.
- Rolling early reduces delivery risk but may increase carry cost.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Futures Rollover and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Futures Rollover as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Futures Rollover, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Futures Rollover. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Futures Rollover alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
