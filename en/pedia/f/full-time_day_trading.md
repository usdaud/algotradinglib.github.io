# Full-Time Day Trading

## Introduction to Day Trading

[Day trading](../d/day_trading.md) is a form of speculating in securities, in which traders buy and sell financial instruments within the same trading day, such that all positions are usually closed before the [market](../m/market.md) closes for the day to avoid unmanageable risks and negative price [gaps](../g/gap.md) between one day's close and the next day's price at the [open](../o/open.md). Day traders utilize a variety of techniques and strategies to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on short-term [market](../m/market.md) movements. This practice requires substantial time, dedication, and a comprehensive understanding of the [trade](../t/trade.md) environment.

## Strategies Employed by Day Traders

### 1. Scalping

**[Scalping](../s/scalping.md)** involves making numerous trades to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on small price movements. Traders aim to make a substantial number of small profits, which, together, can result in significant gains by the end of the day. [Scalping](../s/scalping.md) often requires [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) and algorithms for [execution](../e/execution.md) due to the fast-paced nature of price movements.
  
**Key Techniques in [Scalping](../s/scalping.md):**
- **Spread [Scalping](../s/scalping.md):** Buying at the [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) and selling at the ask price to capture the spread.
- **[Range](../r/range.md) [Scalping](../s/scalping.md):** Trading within predefined [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels to exploit recurring [price patterns](../p/price_patterns.md).

### 2. Momentum Trading

**[Momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md)** focuses on harnessing price movements:
- Identifying assets that are trending significantly in one direction with higher than average trading volumes.
- Utilizing [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) like the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) and moving averages to confirm the [momentum](../m/momentum.md) direction.
  
**Common [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) Strategies:**
- **News-Based Trading:** Entering positions based on the impacts of breaking news or economic reports.
- **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md):** Combining [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to follow established trends until signs of [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

### 3. Reversal Trading

**[Reversal](../r/reversal.md) Trading** aims at identifying the points where trends are likely to reverse temporarily. The success lies in buying low and selling high, or vice versa, within these [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points.

**Tools for [Reversal](../r/reversal.md) Trading:**
- **[Candlestick Patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md):** Such as Engulfing patterns, Hammer, and Hanging Man.
- **[Divergence](../d/divergence.md) Analysis:** Between price and [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md) like MACD and RSI.

### 4. Range Trading

**[Range trading](../r/range_trading.md)** involves identifying common [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels where prices oscillate. Trades are made by buying near support and selling near resistance within a [range](../r/range.md)-bound [market](../m/market.md) environment.

**Critical Aspects:**
- **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md):** To identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.
- **[Volume Analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md):** To confirm the strength of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md).

## Technology in Day Trading

### Trading Platforms

The choice of a [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) is crucial for full-time day traders due to the need for quick, reliable [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) and real-time data.

**Popular Platforms:**
- **MetaTrader 4/5:** Advanced charting and tools for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).
- **[Thinkorswim](../t/thinkorswim.md) by TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md):** Comprehensive analytical capabilities for diverse [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.
- **[NinjaTrader](../n/ninjatrader.md):** Focuses on [futures](../f/futures.md) & forex trading with extensive [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and automation [options](../o/options.md).

### Automated Trading Systems

Automation in trading helps reduce the emotional bias and ensures consistent [execution](../e/execution.md) of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). 

**Types of Automated Systems:**
- **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md):** Using pre-defined rules and algorithms for trading decisions.
- **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** Handling repetitive trading processes.
  
**Notable Companies:**
- **[TradeStation](../t/tradestation.md) [tradestation.com](https://www.tradestation.com/):** Offers [robust](../r/robust.md) platform features suitable for developing and executing automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) [interactivebrokers.com](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/):** Provides extensive [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) services and smart routing capabilities.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

HFT involves making tens of thousands of trades within seconds, leveraging high-speed data and connectivity to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on minimal price discrepancies. Itâ€™s typically out of reach for individual full-time day traders due to the required [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) investments.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Latency [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Exploiting slight time delays in price updates.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Provisioning:** Acting as [market](../m/market.md) makers to benefit from [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md).

### Data Analytics and AI

Analyzing vast sets of [market](../m/market.md) data in real-time for patterns and opportunities is a complex yet vital aspect of [day trading](../d/day_trading.md). AI and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) advanced [predictive analytics](../p/predictive_analytics.md) capabilities.

**Popular Data Analysis Tools:**
- **Python Libraries:** Like Pandas, NumPy, and [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md) for advanced analysis and AI model development.
- **R Shiny:** For interactive web applications focused on [real-time data analysis](../r/real-time_data_analysis.md).

## Psychological and Behavioral Aspects

### Emotional Discipline

[Day trading](../d/day_trading.md) demands stringent emotional discipline. [Psychological biases](../p/psychological_biases_in_trading.md), such as fear and greed, can lead to significant [trade](../t/trade.md) errors.

### Developing a Trading Plan

A solid trading plan with defined entry, exit, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md) rules is essential to mitigate emotional trading.

### Continuous Education

Staying informed about [market](../m/market.md) events, new [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and evolving technologies through webinars, courses, and reading is vital for success.

### Well-Being and Health

Managing stress through regular physical activity, adequate rest, and maintaining work-life balance can mitigate the negative impacts of full-time [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) stress.

## Risk Management

### Limiting Exposure

Ensuring that a single [trade](../t/trade.md) does not endanger an outsized portion of your [capital](../c/capital.md) is fundamental. Implementing [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) and position-sizing techniques can reduce risks.

### Diversification

Spreading trades across various sectors or [asset](../a/asset.md) types can help manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with sector-specific or [asset](../a/asset.md)-specific downturns.

### Using Leveraged Instruments Cautiously

Although leveraging can amplify gains, it also increases [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure. Understanding the associated risks and managing [leverage](../l/leverage.md) prudently is critical.

## Regulatory Environment

### Licensing and Compliance

Ensuring compliance with financial regulations and obtaining necessary licenses, such as those from the Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority ([FINRA](../f/finra.md)), is crucial to protecting your operations and maintaining credibility.

### Tax Implications

Be aware of short-term [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) implications and the need for accurate record-keeping to simplify tax reporting and compliance.

### Broker Selection

Choosing a reliable [broker](../b/broker.md) that ensures regulatory compliance, effective [customer service](../c/customer_service.md), and the best [execution](../e/execution.md) policies can impact trading success.
