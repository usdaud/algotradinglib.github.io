# Form 4506

Form 4506 is an Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) document used by taxpayers to request a copy of a previously filed [tax return](../t/tax_return.md). This form is particularly valuable for individuals requiring a complete duplicate of their tax records for legal purposes, such as divorce proceedings, [loan](../l/loan.md) applications, or other financial verifications. Understanding this form, its application, and how to properly complete and submit it is crucial for ensuring compliance with IRS regulations and for obtaining the necessary financial documentation.

## Purpose of Form 4506

The primary purpose of Form 4506 is to allow taxpayers to obtain a duplicate of a previously submitted [tax return](../t/tax_return.md). The forms that can be requested include:

1. **Form 1040 series** (individual [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) returns)
2. **Form 1120 series** (corporate [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) returns)
3. **[Form 1065](../f/form_1065.md)** (partnership [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) returns)
4. Other forms filed with the IRS such as **Form 941** (employer’s quarterly [tax return](../t/tax_return.md))

A complete copy includes not only the [return](../r/return.md) itself but also any attachments, such as W-2s, schedules, and forms that were originally submitted.

## Situations Warranting the Use of Form 4506

Form 4506 is often required in specific scenarios, including but not limited to:

- **Applying for a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) or [loan](../l/loan.md)**: Lenders often require a copy of tax returns to verify [income](../i/income.md) and financial standing.
- **Tax preparation issues**: If a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) or their preparer has lost the original [return](../r/return.md), a copy can be requested from the IRS.
- **Audits and legal proceedings**: Taxpayers undergoing audits, legal cases, or needing historical [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) information often need an official copy from the IRS.
- **Financial aid**: Some universities and financial institutions require a copy of tax returns for evaluating financial aid eligibility.

## Form 4506 vs. Transcript Requests

It's important to distinguish between Form 4506 and other types of tax document requests:

- **Form 4506-T**: This form is used to request a transcript of the [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), which provides a summary instead of a full copy. Transcripts are often adequate for lenders and other entities requiring tax info.
- **[Tax Return](../t/tax_return.md) Transcript**: Summarizes most line items from the original [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) but does not include any attachments like W-2 forms.
- **Account Transcript**: Provides any changes made to the [return](../r/return.md) after it was filed and any outstanding balances.
- **Record of Account Transcript**: Combines the [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) and account transcript information into one.

## Completing Form 4506

### Personal Information

* Sections 1a and 1b: Enter the name and [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Number (SSN) or Employer Identification Number (EIN) of the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md).
* Section 2a and 2b: If this request is for a [joint return](../j/joint_return.md), the name and SSN of the spouse should be included.

### Address Information

* Section 3: Provide the current name and address of the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md).
* Section 4: If the address on the last filed [return](../r/return.md) differs from the current address, enter the previous address.

### Tax Return Information

* Section 5: Specify the form number of the requested [return](../r/return.md) (e.g., 1040, 1120).
* Section 6: Indicate the tax year(s) or period(s) requested. Up to eight years can be requested on a single form.
* Section 7: If you are requesting a copy of Form W-2 or other returns, they need to be specified here.

### Delivery Information

* Section 8: If the copy needs to be delivered to a [third party](../t/third_party.md) (like a [lender](../l/lender.md) or attorney), provide their name and address.

### Payment Information

The cost is **$43 per [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) copy** requested, and the [fee](../f/fee.md) should be enclosed with the form. [Payment](../p/payment.md) [options](../o/options.md) include:

- [Check](../c/check.md)
- [Money order](../m/money_order.md)
- Indicating the method of [payment](../p/payment.md)

### Signature and Date

The request must be signed and dated. The signer must have the authority to request the copy:

* Individual taxpayers can sign on their own behalf.
* In cases of [joint](../j/joint.md) returns, either spouse can sign unless separated or divorced; additional legal documentation might be required in these cases.
* Corporate requests must be signed by an officer with the legal authority.
* Partnerships require a partner's signature.
* Fiduciary signatures require appropriate authorization.

### Declaration of Representatives

If an attorney, CPA, or other representative is submitting the form, a signed [power of attorney](../p/power_of_attorney.md) ([Form 2848](../f/form_2848.md)) must be included.

## Submission of Form 4506

Submit the completed form and [payment](../p/payment.md) to the applicable IRS address, which can vary based on the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s current residence and the type of [return](../r/return.md). Addresses are provided in the instructions for Form 4506.

## Processing Time

Once submitted, the processing time can vary. On average, it takes about **75 calendar days** to process the request and [issue](../i/issue.md) the duplicate [return](../r/return.md). However, delays can occur during peak periods or if the records need to be retrieved from archives.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Rejected Requests

Common reasons for rejection include:

- Incorrect or incomplete information
- Non-[payment](../p/payment.md) of fees
- Unauthorized signature

To avoid these issues, double-[check](../c/check.md) the form for accuracy and completeness and ensure the correct [payment](../p/payment.md) is included.

### Alternative Solutions

1. **Immediate Needs**: If a detailed [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) is not required, consider requesting a free transcript online, which can be delivered more quickly and at no cost.
2. **Record-Keeping**: Maintain personal copies of tax returns and associated documents in secure storage spaces, either digitally or physically, to avoid future delays or the need for formal requests.
