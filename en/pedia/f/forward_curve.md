# Forward Curve

A forward curve shows the prices of forward contracts across different maturities for a given asset. It provides insight into market expectations, storage costs, and risk premia.

## Curve Shapes
Contango occurs when longer dated contracts trade at higher prices than near dated contracts. Backwardation occurs when longer dated contracts trade at lower prices. The curve can also be flat or irregular depending on supply and demand dynamics.

## Drivers of the Curve
Key drivers include storage costs, financing rates, convenience yield, and expectations of future supply and demand. For financial assets, interest rates and dividends also influence forward prices.

## Trading Applications
Forward curves are used for roll strategies, calendar spreads, and hedging. Traders analyze curve shifts and steepening or flattening moves to capture relative value. Commodity producers and consumers use curves for risk management.

## Risks
Curve dynamics can change quickly during supply shocks or policy shifts. Liquidity may be uneven across maturities, affecting execution quality. Misinterpreting curve signals can lead to persistent losses.

## Conclusion
Forward curves are central to futures and commodities trading. Understanding their structure helps traders assess carry, risk, and relative value opportunities.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Forward Curve and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Forward Curve as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Forward Curve, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Forward Curve. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Forward Curve alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
