# Functional Currency

Functional [currency](../c/currency.md) is a fundamental concept in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [accounting](../a/accounting.md), particularly relevant to businesses and organizations operating internationally. As businesses expand across borders, they encounter [multiple](../m/multiple.md) currencies and must navigate the complexities associated with [currency](../c/currency.md) conversion, reporting, and [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) assessment. The functional [currency](../c/currency.md) is the [currency](../c/currency.md) of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. This comprehensive overview [will](../w/will.md) delve into the various aspects of functional [currency](../c/currency.md), from its definition and determining factors to its impact on [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and international operations.

## Definition and Importance

### Definition
Functional [currency](../c/currency.md) is defined as the [currency](../c/currency.md) of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. Essentially, it is the [currency](../c/currency.md) that most faithfully represents the economic effects of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) transactions, events, and conditions of the entity. The primary economic environment is typically where the entity generates and expends cash.

### Importance
The concept of functional [currency](../c/currency.md) is critical for financial reporting and compliance with [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP). It ensures consistency and comparability in [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), allowing stakeholders such as investors, regulators, and management to make informed decisions.

## Determining Functional Currency

### Primary Factors
Determining an entity's functional [currency](../c/currency.md) involves considering several primary factors:

1. **[Currency](../c/currency.md) of Sales**: The [currency](../c/currency.md) in which sales prices for goods and services are denominated and settled.
2. **[Currency](../c/currency.md) of Incurred Costs**: The [currency](../c/currency.md) in which costs of labor, materials, and other expenses are denominated and settled.
3. **[Financing](../f/financing.md) [Currency](../c/currency.md)**: The [currency](../c/currency.md) in which funding and [financing](../f/financing.md) activities are conducted, including both [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments.
4. **Operating [Currency](../c/currency.md)**: The [currency](../c/currency.md) used in maintaining the entity's day-to-day operations and cash flows.

### Secondary Factors
Secondary factors, which may also influence the determination of functional [currency](../c/currency.md), include:
- The [currency](../c/currency.md) in which [receipts](../r/receipt.md) from [operating activities](../o/operating_activities.md) are usually retained.
- The [currency](../c/currency.md) in which distributions are made to shareholders.
- The [currency](../c/currency.md) of the country whose competitive forces and regulations primarily determine the sales prices of goods and services.

## Functional Currency in Consolidation

When a [multinational corporation](../m/multinational_corporation.md) prepares consolidated [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), each entity within the group must determine its own functional [currency](../c/currency.md). These individual [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) are then translated into the presentation [currency](../c/currency.md) of the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md). The translation process involves three main steps:

1. **Assets and Liabilities**: Translated at the closing rate at the date of the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md).
2. **[Income](../i/income.md) and Expenses**: Translated at [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates at the dates of the transactions or an average rate if it approximates the actual rates.
3. **[Equity](../e/equity.md)**: Translated at historical rates.

## Change in Functional Currency

An entity's functional [currency](../c/currency.md) should reflect its primary economic environment. However, there are circumstances under which the functional [currency](../c/currency.md) can change. A change in functional [currency](../c/currency.md) is usually a result of significant changes to those [underlying](../u/underlying.md) factors, such as a shift in the [market](../m/market.md) or [economy](../e/economy.md) wherein the entity operates.

### Accounting for Change
When an entity changes its functional [currency](../c/currency.md), it should apply the translation procedures applicable to the new functional [currency](../c/currency.md) prospectively from the date of the change. The translated amounts for non-monetary items recorded in the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) at the date of the change should be treated as if they were the historical costs for those items.

## Functional Currency and Foreign Currency Translation

### Foreign Currency Transactions
Foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) transactions are those that are denominated or require settlement in a foreign [currency](../c/currency.md). The initial recognition is made at the functional [currency](../c/currency.md) using the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) at the date of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

### Reporting Foreign Currency
At each subsequent [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) date:
- Monetary items (e.g., cash, receivables, payables) are translated at the closing rate.
- Non-monetary items measured at [historical cost](../h/historical_cost.md) are translated at the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates at the date of the initial [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
- Non-monetary items measured at [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) are translated at the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates at the date when the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) was determined.

### Foreign Operations
When translating the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) of a foreign operation, the financial results and positions of the foreign operation are determined as follows:
- [Income](../i/income.md) and expenses are translated at the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates at the dates of the transactions.
- Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate.
- The resulting [exchange](../e/exchange.md) differences are recognized in other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md).

## Impact of Functional Currency on Financial Statements

The choice of functional [currency](../c/currency.md) has a significant impact on an entity's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). It affects how transactions and balances are measured and reported. Here's how it can affect various financial statement components:

### Income Statement
Revenues and expenses may fluctuate due to changes in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, impacting an entity's reported profitability. This fluctuation can create a challenge for investors and analysts trying to assess the performance of a multinational entity.

### Balance Sheet
The reported amounts of assets and liabilities can be significantly affected by the functional [currency](../c/currency.md). In particular, the [value](../v/value.md) of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities [will](../w/will.md) vary with [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) movements, adding [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md).

### Cash Flow Statement
Cash flows from operating, [investing](../i/investing.md), and [financing](../f/financing.md) activities need to be translated into the functional [currency](../c/currency.md). Fluctuations in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates can influence the reported cash flows, affecting [liquidity analysis](../l/liquidity_analysis.md) and [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) management.

## Case Studies and Real-World Examples

### Tesla Inc.
Tesla Inc. operates in various countries, generating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and incurring costs in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) currencies. The company's functional [currency](../c/currency.md) is the U.S. Dollar (USD), reflected in its financial reporting. Tesla's international operations must translate their results into USD for [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) purposes, impacting reported revenues, expenses, and profitability.

### Amazon.com, Inc.
Amazon.com, Inc. operates numerous subsidiaries globally, each potentially having different functional currencies based on their primary economic environments. The [parent company](../p/parent_company.md)'s presentation [currency](../c/currency.md) is USD, necessitating the translation of each subsidiary's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) into USD for consolidated reporting.

### BP plc
BP plc, a British multinational oil and gas company, operates in numerous countries. For example, its operations in the Middle East and Northern Africa region might use local currencies as functional currencies, while the presentation [currency](../c/currency.md) for consolidated [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) is USD.

## Tools and Technologies for Managing Functional Currency
