# 10-Day RSI

The 10-Day [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements over a 10-day period. Developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr., RSI is one of the most widely used [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) in trading. The RSI provides signals indicating [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in a [market](../m/market.md), helping traders make entry and exit decisions.

## Calculation of 10-Day RSI

The RSI is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{RSI} = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS} \]

where:

\[ RS = \frac{\text{Average [Gain](../g/gain.md)}}{\text{Average Loss}} \]

For a 10-Day RSI:

1. Compute the daily price changes.
2. Separate the changes into gains and losses.
3. Calculate the average [gain](../g/gain.md) and average loss over the first 10 periods.
4. For subsequent periods, use a smoothed average that incorporates the previous dayâ€™s results.

Mathematically, the smoothed averages can be represented as:

\[ \text{Average [Gain](../g/gain.md)} = \frac{(\text{Previous Average [Gain](../g/gain.md)} \times 9) + \text{Current [Gain](../g/gain.md)}}{10} \]

\[ \text{Average Loss} = \frac{(\text{Previous Average Loss} \times 9) + \text{Current Loss}}{10} \]

## Interpretation of RSI Values

RSI values [range](../r/range.md) from 0 to 100 and can typically be interpreted as follows:

- **Above 70**: The [asset](../a/asset.md) is considered [overbought](../o/overbought.md), signaling a potential [pullback](../p/pullback.md) or [correction](../c/correction.md).
- **Below 30**: The [asset](../a/asset.md) is considered [oversold](../o/oversold.md), indicating a potential upward [correction](../c/correction.md).
- **Between 30 and 70**: The [asset](../a/asset.md) is likely to be in a stable trading [range](../r/range.md).

However, traders often adjust these thresholds based on the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s history and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Applications in Algo-Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the 10-Day RSI can be used in the development of automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). These strategies might involve:

1. **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md)**: Using RSI to identify the strength of a [trend](../t/trend.md) and enter trades aligned with that [trend](../t/trend.md).
2. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Entering trades when RSI indicates [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions, anticipating that the price [will](../w/will.md) revert to the mean.
3. **[Divergence](../d/divergence.md) Trading**: Identifying divergences between RSI and price movements to signal potential reversals.

### Example Strategy

A simple RSI-based [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) might be as follows:

- **Buy Signal**: When the 10-Day RSI crosses above 30.
- **Sell Signal**: When the 10-Day RSI crosses below 70.

Many platforms and programming languages, such as Python with the `pandas` and `ta-lib` libraries, allow traders to backtest and execute such strategies.

## Combining RSI with Other Indicators

RSI is often used in conjunction with other indicators to improve the robustness of [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md). Common combinations include:

- **Moving Averages (MA)**: To confirm trends signaled by the RSI.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md))**: To provide additional confirmation of buy/sell signals.
- **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: To identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md)/[oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in conjunction with RSI.

## Platforms for RSI-Based Algo-Trading

Several platforms and software [offer](../o/offer.md) tools for implementing and [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) RSI-based strategies:

- **MetaTrader 4/5**: A popular [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) that supports automated trading through Expert Advisors (EAs).
- **[NinjaTrader](../n/ninjatrader.md)**: Offers advanced charting and [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) capabilities.
- **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)**: A cloud-based platform allowing [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) languages, including Python.
- **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md)**: Provides scripting tools (Pine Script) for creating and testing custom RSI strategies.

## Real-World Usage

Major [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and trading firms utilize RSI in their algorithmic strategies, although they often combine it with more complex algorithms and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models.

For example, Renaissance Technologies, one of the most successful [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, is known for using sophisticated algorithms that likely combine [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), including RSI. More about Renaissance Technologies can be found [here](https://www.rentec.com/).

## Conclusion

The 10-Day RSI is a versatile and widely-used technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) in both manual and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Its ability to signal [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions makes it a valuable tool for various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). By combining RSI with other indicators and using modern trading platforms, traders can enhance their decision-making process and potentially improve their trading outcomes.
