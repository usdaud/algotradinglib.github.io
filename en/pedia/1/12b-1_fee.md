# 12B-1 Fee

A 12B-1 [fee](../f/fee.md) is a type of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) [fee](../f/fee.md) that investors might encounter. These fees are named after a [provision](../p/provision.md) in the [Investment Company Act of 1940](../i/investment_company_act_of_1940.md), which was amended in 1980 to include Section 12(b), Subsection 1. This section allows mutual funds to use [fund](../f/fund.md) assets to cover the costs related to [distribution](../d/distribution.md) and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) services. Essentially, a 12B-1 [fee](../f/fee.md) is an annual [marketing](../m/marketing.md) or [distribution](../d/distribution.md) [fee](../f/fee.md) on a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md).

## The Structure and Purpose of 12B-1 Fees

The 12B-1 [fee](../f/fee.md) is often broken down into two parts: the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) [fee](../f/fee.md) and the service [fee](../f/fee.md). The total [fee](../f/fee.md) can be up to 1% of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s net assets per year, with the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) [fee](../f/fee.md) generally capped at 0.75% and the service [fee](../f/fee.md) capped at 0.25%.

### Distribution Fee

The [distribution](../d/distribution.md) [fee](../f/fee.md) is used to pay for activities and services related to the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [shares](../s/shares.md). These activities can include:

- Advertising
- [Marketing](../m/marketing.md) materials
- Sales commissions to brokers and financial advisors

This [fee](../f/fee.md) is essentially designed to attract more investors to the [fund](../f/fund.md), thereby increasing the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets and potentially diluting expenses across a larger pool of assets.

### Service Fee

The service [fee](../f/fee.md), on the other hand, is used to compensate brokers and other financial professionals for providing ongoing services to shareholders. These services can include:

- Responding to [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) inquiries
- Providing statements
- Processing transactions
- [Offering](../o/offering.md) investment advice

Together, these fees aim to boost the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s profile in the [market](../m/market.md) and ensure that shareholders receive quality service.

## Justification and Criticism

### Justification

Proponents of [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) argue that they can help mutual funds grow by [financing](../f/financing.md) the [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) activities necessary to attract new investors. Theoretically, as the [fund](../f/fund.md) grows, its cost structure improves due to [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md), which can benefit existing shareholders. The fees can also help ensure that shareholders receive adequate service.

### Criticism

Critics, however, argue that [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) can be excessive and are sometimes misrepresented or poorly disclosed. They also question the effectiveness of these fees in actually contributing to the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s growth. Critics point out that the fees primarily benefit brokers and financial advisors rather than the [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md)’s shareholders.

Regulatory bodies like the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) have scrutinized these fees, and there have been calls for greater [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and even elimination of these fees in certain circumstances.

## Regulatory Aspects and Disclosure Requirements

### Regulatory Oversight

The SEC oversees the use of [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) and requires mutual funds to disclose them clearly in their prospectuses. The [fund](../f/fund.md)’s board of directors, especially the independent directors, must annually review and approve the [12B-1 plan](../1/12b-1_plan.md). They are required to ensure that the fees are reasonable and primarily benefit the investors.

### Disclosure in Prospectus

Transparent [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) is mandatory. Mutual funds must specify the amount of [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) in their [prospectus](../p/prospectus.md) and annual reports. Additionally, the total [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md), which includes [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md), administrative fees, and other costs, must be disclosed to give investors a complete picture of what they are paying.

### Share Classes

Different mutual funds might have various share classes (like Class A, Class B, and Class C) that entail different [fee](../f/fee.md) structures. For instance:

- **Class A [shares](../s/shares.md)** typically have a [front-end load](../f/front-end_load.md) and lower [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md).
- **Class B [shares](../s/shares.md)** might have a back-end [load](../l/load.md) and higher [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md).
- **Class C [shares](../s/shares.md)** often have no [load](../l/load.md) but higher [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md).

Understanding these distinctions is vital for investors to make informed decisions.

## Example of Companies Utilizing 12B-1 Fees

Several prominent [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) companies incorporate [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) as part of their cost structure. Some of these companies include:

- Fidelity Investments
- BlackRock
- T. Rowe Price
- American Funds

**Note:** Vanguard Group is notably known for NOT charging 12B-1 fees on its funds, as the company was founded on the principle of low-cost investing.

These companies clearly outline their [fee](../f/fee.md) structures, including [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md), in their [fund](../f/fund.md) prospectuses and annual reports.

## Alternatives to 12B-1 Fees

Given the criticism surrounding [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md), some mutual funds have started to forego these charges. Alternatives include no-[load](../l/load.md) funds and direct purchase funds.

### No-Load Funds

No-[load](../l/load.md) funds do not charge [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md). They have become increasingly popular as they [offer](../o/offer.md) a transparent [fee](../f/fee.md) structure. However, these funds still need to cover [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) costs, often achieved through other means like [direct marketing](../d/direct_marketing.md) and online platforms.

### Fee-Only Financial Advisors

Some investors prefer working with [fee](../f/fee.md)-only financial advisors who charge a flat [fee](../f/fee.md) or hourly rate instead of earning commissions through [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md). This model ensures that the advisor's compensation is directly tied to the advisory services they provide, rather than selling specific products.

## Conclusion

The 12B-1 [fee](../f/fee.md) is a significant aspect of the [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) [industry](../i/industry.md), providing a mechanism for funds to cover [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) costs. While these fees can help funds grow and provide services to shareholders, they have also been criticized for potential conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md) and lack of [transparency](../t/transparency.md). Regulatory oversight and clear [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) are crucial in ensuring that these fees serve the best interests of investors.

Understanding [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) helps investors make more informed decisions, facilitating better investment strategies tailored to their financial goals.
