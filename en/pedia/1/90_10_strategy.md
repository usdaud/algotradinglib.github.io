# 90/10 Strategy

The 90/10 strategy in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is a sophisticated approach that aims to optimize the performance of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) by allocating 90% of the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md) to low-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-certainty trades, and 10% to high-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-reward trades. This strategy strikes a balance between steady profits and the potential for high [earnings](../e/earnings.md) from occasional, higher-[risk](../r/risk.md) trades.

## Introduction to Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as algo-trading or black-box trading, involves using computer algorithms to automate trading decisions and strategies. These algorithms are designed to follow specific instructions (such as timing, price, or [volume](../v/volume.md)) and can execute trades at speeds and frequencies far greater than human traders.

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is used by institutional investors and large brokerage firms to manage portfolios. However, the advancements in technology have made it accessible for retail traders as well. The key benefits of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) include reduced [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), increased trading [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), and removal of human emotions from trading decisions.

## Core Principles of the 90/10 Strategy

The 90/10 strategy hinges on two core principles: [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [diversification](../d/diversification.md). By dividing the [capital](../c/capital.md) into two distinct pools, traders can manage risks more effectively while still allowing room for significant gains.

### 1. The 90% Allocation: Low-Risk Trades

- **Nature of Low-[Risk](../r/risk.md) Trades**: These are trades that involve lower [volatility](../v/volatility.md), more predictable assets, and shorter time frames. Examples may include high-grade corporate bonds, blue-chip [stocks](../s/stock.md), or trades based on [market](../m/market.md)-moving news backed by strong data.
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Algorithms for these trades might employ mean-reversion strategies, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities, or [trend](../t/trend.md)-following methods based on [robust](../r/robust.md) statistical models.
- **Objective**: The primary goal is to ensure steady, consistent returns with minimal drawdowns. This portion of the strategy focuses on safeguarding the bulk of the [capital](../c/capital.md) and [compounding](../c/compounding.md) modest gains over time.

### 2. The 10% Allocation: High-Risk Trades

- **Nature of High-[Risk](../r/risk.md) Trades**: These are speculative trades that involve higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md), riskier assets, and longer time frames. Examples include small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md), cryptocurrencies, or leveraged positions.
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Algorithms for these trades can use strategies like [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md), position trading, or [options](../o/options.md) trading based on [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) that identify high-reward opportunities.
- **Objective**: The aim is to achieve significant gains from a small portion of the [capital](../c/capital.md), accepting the higher [risk](../r/risk.md) involved. This part of the strategy leverages the potential for high returns to boost the overall performance of the portfolio.

## Development and Implementation of the 90/10 Strategy

Creating a 90/10 strategy involves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) steps, including designing, [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md), optimizing, and deploying the algorithms.

### 1. Designing the Strategy

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Analysis**: Understand the [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) and identify low-[risk](../r/risk.md) and high-[risk](../r/risk.md) opportunities.
- **[Algorithm Design](../a/algorithm_design.md)**: Develop algorithms tailored to different [market](../m/market.md) conditions and [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md).

### 2. Backtesting

- **Historical Data**: Use historical [market](../m/market.md) data to simulate trading and assess the strategy's performance.
- **Metrics Evaluation**: Analyze key [performance indicators](../p/performance_indicators.md) (KPIs) such as [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), maximum [drawdown](../d/drawdown.md), and annualized [return](../r/return.md) to ensure the strategy's robustness.

### 3. Optimization

- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust the algorithm parameters to improve [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).
- **[Stress Testing](../s/stress_testing_in_trading.md)**: Test the strategy under various [market](../m/market.md) conditions to identify potential weaknesses.

### 4. Deployment

- **Live Trading**: Deploy the algorithms in a real [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md) using a reliable [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md).
- **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Continuously monitor the performance and make necessary adjustments to the strategy.

## Risk Management in the 90/10 Strategy

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial for the success of the 90/10 strategy. Key [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices include:

### 1. Position Sizing

- **Fixed Fractional Method**: Determine the position size as a fixed percentage of the total [capital](../c/capital.md).
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)-Based [Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Adjust position sizes based on the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to protect against large losses.

### 2. Stop-Loss Orders

- **Automated Stop-Loss**: Set predefined stop-loss levels to automatically exit trades that move against the position.
- **[Trailing Stop](../t/trailing_stop.md)-Loss**: Use trailing [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md) as the [trade](../t/trade.md) moves in favor.

### 3. Diversification

- **Cross-[Asset](../a/asset.md) [Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Spread investments across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Time [Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Operate algorithms that [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on different time frames to balance short-term and long-term risks.

## Examples and Case Studies

QuantInsti offers educational resources and strategies for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), including the 90/10 strategy. They emphasize the importance of data analysis, algorithmic design, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) in executing successful 90/10 strategies. More

### Example 2: Proprietary Trading Firms

[Proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms often use the 90/10 strategy to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their portfolios. They focus on [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategies for the 90% allocation and high-[beta](../b/beta.md) strategies for the 10%. These firms [leverage](../l/leverage.md) their advanced technology and [market](../m/market.md) access to optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Conclusion

The 90/10 strategy in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) offers a balanced approach to [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward. By allocating 90% of the [capital](../c/capital.md) to low-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-certainty trades and 10% to high-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-reward trades, traders can achieve consistent returns while still capturing significant gains from speculative opportunities. Effective implementation of this strategy requires [robust](../r/robust.md) [algorithm design](../a/algorithm_design.md), rigorous [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md), and proactive [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

The evolution of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and advancements in AI and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) continue to enhance the success of strategies like the 90/10 approach. As traders and firms adapt to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions, the 90/10 strategy remains an essential part of the [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) toolkit.
