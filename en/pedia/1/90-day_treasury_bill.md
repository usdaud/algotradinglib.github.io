# 90-Day Treasury Bill

The 90-Day Treasury Bill (T-Bill) is a [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) obligation backed by the U.S. government with a [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of 90 days. As a cornerstone instrument in the [money](../m/money.md) markets, it provides numerous advantages and insights into [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), especially in the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Here, we delve into the intricate details of the 90-Day T-Bill, its workings, implications, and significance in the realm of algotrading.

### Understanding Treasury Bills

**Treasury Bills (T-Bills)** are one of the safest investments available and a key fixture of the U.S. financial [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). These are short-term securities with maturities ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. T-Bills are sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to [face value](../f/face_value.md) (par) and do not provide periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments; the [interest](../i/interest.md) is implied in the difference between the purchase price and the [par value](../p/par_value.md) paid at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Key Characteristics of 90-Day T-Bills

1. **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**: As the name suggests, a 90-Day T-Bill matures in 90 days from the [issue](../i/issue.md) date.
2. **Auction Process**: These T-Bills are sold through a competitive bidding process conducted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Auctions are frequent, typically every week.
3. **[Yield](../y/yield.md) Calculation**: The [yield](../y/yield.md) of a 90-Day T-Bill is determined by the difference between its purchase price and the amount received at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).
4. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: 90-Day T-Bills are highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md), making them an ideal vehicle for short-term parking of funds.
5. **[Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Given their backing by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government, 90-Day T-Bills are considered virtually [risk](../r/risk.md)-free with no [default risk](../d/default_risk.md).

### Importance in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (algotrading) refers to the use of computer algorithms to execute [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) at speeds and frequencies infeasible for human traders. T-Bills, including the 90-Day T-Bill, play a critical role in this space due to several reasons:

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Algotrading strategies often require managing large sums of [money](../m/money.md) where [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md) is crucial. The stability and [security](../s/security.md) of 90-Day T-Bills make them a [safe haven](../s/safe_haven.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) for temporary cash storage.
2. **[Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Rates**: The [yield](../y/yield.md) on 90-Day T-Bills serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for various other financial instruments. It is often used as a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate in financial models, providing a foundation for pricing [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and assessing the [risk](../r/risk.md) premiums of other securities.
3. **[Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) [Indicator](../i/indicator.md)**: The [demand](../d/demand.md) for T-Bills can be an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). High [demand](../d/demand.md) for 90-Day T-Bills may indicate a flight to safety by investors, suggesting an increase in [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or economic [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). Algorithms can be designed to interpret these signals and adjust [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) accordingly.
4. **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Predictions**: Movements in the yields of 90-Day T-Bills can help in predicting the future trajectory of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. This is invaluable for algotrading strategies that are sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations.

### Auction Mechanism

**Non-Competitive Bids**: Non-competitive bids are guaranteed to be filled and allow smaller investors to participate without specifying the [yield](../y/yield.md) they are willing to accept. The rate received is the average rate of all the competitive bids accepted.

**Competitive Bids**: Institutional investors and sophisticated traders typically place competitive bids, specifying the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) they are willing to accept. T-Bills are then awarded starting from the lowest [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) until the entire [issue](../i/issue.md) amount is allocated.

### Calculating Yield on 90-Day T-Bills

The [yield](../y/yield.md) on a T-Bill can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)} - \text{Purchase Price}}{\text{Purchase Price}} \right) \times \left( \frac{365}{\text{Days to [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)}} \right) \]

For a 90-Day T-Bill:
\[ \text{[Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \left( \frac{\$10,000 - \$9,900}{\$9,900} \right) \times \left( \frac{365}{90} \right) \approx 4.05\% \]

### Historical Performance and Analysis

Over the decades, the [yield](../y/yield.md) on 90-Day T-Bills has fluctuated significantly, reflecting varying [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and [Federal Reserve policies](../f/federal_reserve_policies.md). For instance:

- **1980s**: Periods of high [inflation](../i/inflation.md) saw T-Bill yields surge.
- **Early 2000s**: Yields plummeted following the dot-com bubble burst and 9/11 attacks.
- **2008 [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md)**: Yields dropped near zero as investors flocked to safety amidst unprecedented [market](../m/market.md) turbulence.
- **Recent Trends**: Yields remain relatively low but have witnessed increases following policy rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

2. **Rate Spread [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: [Leverage](../l/leverage.md) the [spreads](../s/spreads.md) between different T-Bill maturities to implement [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies.
3. **Hedging**: Use 90-Day T-Bills as a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against uncertain [market](../m/market.md) conditions or specific portfolio exposures.
4. **[Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md) Analysis**: Incorporate [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) data into [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models to predict [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md) and adjust [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) accordingly.

### Conclusion

The 90-Day Treasury Bill is a fundamental [asset](../a/asset.md) that offers both safety and strategic [value](../v/value.md), especially in a highly automated [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md). Its attributes, historical significance, and role in [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) mechanisms make it a vital tool for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), [market](../m/market.md) analysis, and [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) formulation.
