# 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgage

A 3-[2-1 buydown](../1/2-1_buydown.md) [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is a type of [loan](../l/loan.md) structure that allows borrowers to gradually step up their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments over a specified period. This arrangement is commonly used by first-time homebuyers or individuals anticipating an increase in their [income](../i/income.md) in the coming years. The concept behind a 3-[2-1 buydown](../1/2-1_buydown.md) [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is to [offer](../o/offer.md) a more affordable and manageable way to enter homeownership by reducing initial monthly payments and increasing them gradually.

## Meaning of 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgage

The term "3-[2-1 buydown](../1/2-1_buydown.md)" refers to the sequence in which the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is reduced over the first three years. Here's how it works:
- **Year 1:** The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is reduced by 3% from the [note](../n/note.md) rate.
- **Year 2:** The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is reduced by 2% from the [note](../n/note.md) rate.
- **Year 3:** The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is reduced by 1% from the [note](../n/note.md) rate.
- **Year 4 and beyond:** The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) returns to the original [note](../n/note.md) rate for the remaining term of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

For example, if the [note](../n/note.md) rate on the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is 5%, the effective [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for a 3-[2-1 buydown](../1/2-1_buydown.md) [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) would be 2% in the first year, 3% in the second year, 4% in the third year, and the full 5% starting in the fourth year.

## Pros of 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgage

### 1. Lower Initial Payments
During the first three years of the [loan](../l/loan.md), borrowers benefit from lower monthly payments, which can alleviate financial stress and make homeownership more accessible. This is particularly advantageous for first-time homebuyers or those anticipating a significant increase in [income](../i/income.md).

### 2. Easier Qualification
With lower initial payments, some borrowers might find it easier to qualify for a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), as lenders typically calculate affordability based on the initial [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts.

### 3. Gradual Adjustment
The gradual increase in payments can make it easier for borrowers to adjust their household budgets over time. This is especially helpful for individuals expecting salary increases or other [income](../i/income.md) growth in the near future.

### 4. Seller Assistance
In some cases, sellers may be willing to contribute towards the buydown as an incentive to buyers. This can make the property more attractive without reducing the [sale](../s/sale.md) price.

### 5. Potential for Refinancing
If [interest](../i/interest.md) rates drop, borrowers might have the opportunity to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) to a lower fixed rate before the initial buydown period ends, thereby locking in lower payments for the remaining term.

## Cons of 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgage

### 1. Higher Total Interest Costs
Because the borrower eventually reverts to the original, higher [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), the total amount of [interest](../i/interest.md) paid over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md) could be greater. Additionally, the upfront cost of the buydown needs to be covered, which is either paid by the borrower, the seller, or incorporated into the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### 2. Potential Payment Shock
After the buydown period ends, there may be a significant increase in monthly payments. Borrowers need to be certain they can [handle](../h/handle.md) the higher payments once the initial reduced rate period expires.

### 3. Restrictions and Qualifications
Some lenders may set eligibility criteria for 3-[2-1 buydown](../1/2-1_buydown.md) mortgages, and not all borrowers may qualify. Additionally, not all lenders [offer](../o/offer.md) this type of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) product.

### 4. Lost Investment Opportunities
The funds used to pay for the buydown could potentially be invested elsewhere at a higher [return](../r/return.md). Borrowers need to evaluate the [opportunity cost](../o/opportunity_cost.md) of [tying](../t/tying.md) up their [capital](../c/capital.md) in the buydown.

### 5. Refinancing Challenges
Refinancing opportunities might not always be available, especially if [market](../m/market.md) conditions change unfavorably. Borrowers should consider the possibility of being locked into the higher post-buydown [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).
