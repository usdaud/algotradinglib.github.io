# 125% Loan

A 125% [loan](../l/loan.md) is a type of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) arrangement in which the borrower is lent an amount that exceeds the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the property being purchased. This kind of [loan](../l/loan.md) has become less common but had gained popularity during economic booms or in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) markets where property prices were continually rising. The "125%" figure means that the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount is 25% higher than the [value](../v/value.md) of the property. For example, if a property is valued at $160,000, a borrower could receive a [loan](../l/loan.md) of $200,000.

## Purpose and Usage

The primary purpose of a 125% [loan](../l/loan.md) is to allow buyers to:

1. **Purchase Property with Zero or [Negative Equity](../n/negative_equity.md)**: Investors or homeowners may need to get into a hot [market](../m/market.md) quickly and are willing to take a [risk](../r/risk.md).
2. **[Fund](../f/fund.md) [Home](../h/home.md) Improvements**: The extra funds can be used to improve the property, potentially increasing its [value](../v/value.md).
3. **Consolidate High-[Interest](../i/interest.md) [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Borrowers may use a 125% [loan](../l/loan.md) to pay off higher-[interest](../i/interest.md) [debt](../d/debt.md), such as [credit](../c/credit.md) cards.

### Illustration of Usage

Consider a homeowner whose property is worth $160,000. They took out a 125% [loan](../l/loan.md) which means they borrowed $200,000. $160,000 goes to the property while the remaining $40,000 could be used for various purposes like [home](../h/home.md) improvement or [debt consolidation](../d/debt_consolidation.md).

## Advantages

### 1. Access to More Funds
Borrowers can access funds in excess of their property's present [market value](../m/market_value.md). This extra [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can be used for improvements, [debt consolidation](../d/debt_consolidation.md), or other personal or investment needs.

### 2. Lower Initial Payments
In some cases, a higher [loan](../l/loan.md)-to-[value](../v/value.md) ratio can mean that the initial payments are lower, making it easier for some borrowers to afford [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments in the short term.

### 3. Potential for Increased Property Value
If borrowers use the extra funds for property improvements, they might increase the [home](../h/home.md)’s [value](../v/value.md), thereby improving their [equity](../e/equity.md) position.

## Disadvantages

### 1. Risk of Negative Equity
If property values decline, homeowners could end up owing more on their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) than the property is worth. This scenario, known as "[negative equity](../n/negative_equity.md)" or "being [underwater](../u/underwater.md)," can be financially detrimental.

### 2. Higher Interest Rates
Lenders charge higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for these types of loans to balance the [risk](../r/risk.md). These elevated rates can lead to substantially higher long-term costs for borrowers.

### 3. Greater Financial Strain
Borrowers with a 125% [loan](../l/loan.md) are at a greater [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md), especially during economic downturns. The additional [debt](../d/debt.md) can become a significant burden if the property's [value](../v/value.md) does not increase as anticipated.

### 4. Limited Availability
Due to the [risk](../r/risk.md) to both lenders and borrowers, 125% loans are not commonly offered. This limited availability can make it difficult to secure such a [loan](../l/loan.md).

## Historical Context

The concept of 125% loans peaked in popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, especially during the [housing bubble](../h/housing_bubble.md) in the United States. High property values and the expectation of continued appreciation led both lenders and borrowers to take on these high-[risk](../r/risk.md) transactions. Following the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), the availability of such loans diminished greatly due to their involvement in the widespread [negative equity](../n/negative_equity.md) and financial instability.

## Who Offers These Loans?

125% loans are usually offered by specialized lending institutions and are less common among traditional banks and [credit](../c/credit.md) unions due to their high-[risk](../r/risk.md) nature. If available, they are often through [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) brokers or non-traditional lenders.

For instance, specialized online lending platforms such as SoFi, LoanDepot, and Quicken Loans may [offer](../o/offer.md) varying degrees of high [loan](../l/loan.md)-to-[value](../v/value.md) mortgages.
However, these companies need to be researched to confirm current offerings as [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and lending policies continually evolve.

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

### 1. Mortgage Lender Regulations
Lenders must comply with federal and state regulations designed to protect consumers, which include requirements for full [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of the terms of the [loan](../l/loan.md), the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and the potential risks involved.

### 2. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
In the UK, for example, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) would regulate such transactions, ensuring that lenders provide clear information about the risks and that they do not engage in predatory lending practices.

### 3. Dodd-Frank Act
In the United States, the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) established new regulations for [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending, ensuring that borrowers receive a clear understanding of the terms and potential risks of high LTV loans.

## Alternatives to 125% Loans

Due to the associated risks, borrowers might consider other financial mechanisms:

1. **[Home Equity](../h/home_equity.md) Loans or Lines of [Credit](../c/credit.md) (HELOCs)**: These [options](../o/options.md) allow homeowners to borrow against the [value](../v/value.md) of their [home](../h/home.md) but typically [offer](../o/offer.md) a safer [loan](../l/loan.md)-to-[value](../v/value.md) ratio.

2. **Personal Loans**: Might be used to consolidate [debt](../d/debt.md) without putting the [home](../h/home.md) at [risk](../r/risk.md).

3. **FHA 203(k) Loans**: Federal Housing Administration offers loans for purchasers and those looking to renovate which might include more [robust](../r/robust.md) safeguards compared to a high LTV [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).

4. **Traditional Mortgages with Lower LTV**: Opting for a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) that offers a more balanced [loan](../l/loan.md)-to-[value](../v/value.md) ratio could be a safer option in the [long run](../l/long_run.md).

## Conclusion

While a 125% [loan](../l/loan.md) offers enhanced immediate [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for borrowers, its high [risk](../r/risk.md) due to the potential for [negative equity](../n/negative_equity.md) and higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates often outweighs the benefits. Since its inherent risks are significant, understanding the economic environment, regulatory requirements, and personal financial standing is crucial for anyone considering such a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md). Potential borrowers should thoroughly consult with financial advisors to explore alternative lending [options](../o/options.md) that might [offer](../o/offer.md) more [security](../s/security.md) and sustainability.
