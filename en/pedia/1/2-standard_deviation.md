# 2-Standard Deviation

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md), the 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) is a key statistical tool that traders and analysts [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to make informed trading decisions. This tool primarily revolves around the concepts of the [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) and [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md), which are fundamental in [statistics](../s/statistics.md) and [probability theory](../p/probability_theory_in_trading.md).

## Normal Distribution

A [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md), also known as a [Gaussian distribution](../g/gaussian_distribution.md), is a [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md) that is symmetric about the mean. This means that most of the observations cluster around the central peak and the probabilities for values further away from the mean taper off equally in both directions. The properties of a [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) are crucial for understanding [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) and its applications.

## Standard Deviation

[Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) is a measure of the amount of variation or [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) of a set of values. In financial contexts, it is used to measure the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price. The formula for calculating [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) is as follows:

\[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2} \]

Where:
- \(\sigma\) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)
- \(N\) is the number of observations
- \(x_i\) is each individual observation
- \(\mu\) is the mean (average) of the observations

## 2-Standard Deviation

The term “2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)” refers to the [range](../r/range.md) within which approximately 95% of a normally distributed data set falls. This concept is derived from the [empirical rule](../e/empirical_rule.md), or the 68-95-99.7 rule, which states:
- 68% of values fall within 1 [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the mean
- 95% of values fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean
- 99.7% of values fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean

### Mathematical Representation

Mathematically, the 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) [range](../r/range.md) is represented as:
\[ \mu \pm 2\sigma \]

Where:
- \(\mu\) is the mean of the data set
- \( \sigma \) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the data set

### Importance in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves using pre-programmed trading instructions to execute orders at high speed and frequency. Traders use [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and algorithms to analyze data and make trading decisions.

The 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) plays a significant role in the development of these models. It helps traders identify:
- **Price anomalies**: When an [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price moves beyond the 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) [range](../r/range.md), it suggests a significant deviation from the norm, indicating potential trading opportunities due to [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.
- **[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Understanding the 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) [range](../r/range.md) helps traders manage [risk](../r/risk.md) by setting stop-loss and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) levels.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: The [range](../r/range.md) provides insights into the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s [volatility](../v/volatility.md), aiding in the concoction of [volatility](../v/volatility.md)-based [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Bollinger Bands

One of the most prominent applications of the 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is the use of [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md). [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) over time for a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) or [commodity](../c/commodity.md).

Consisting of three lines:
- The middle line is a simple moving average (SMA)
- The upper and lower bands are plotted 2 standard deviations away from the SMA

[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) provide a visual depiction of the price relative to [historical volatility](../h/historical_volatility.md), making them useful for:
- **Identifying [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions**: When the price touches the upper band, the [asset](../a/asset.md) may be [overbought](../o/overbought.md), and when it touches the lower band, it may be [oversold](../o/oversold.md).
- **[Trend analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md)**: The bands can indicate the strength and direction of trends.

## Relevance to Financial Institutions and Companies

Many financial institutions and companies use the concept of 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) in their [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies. For instance:

- **Goldman Sachs**: Known for their sophisticated [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), Goldman Sachs utilizes statistical tools like the 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) to inform their trading decisions. Goldman Sachs
- **Jane Street**: A [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) that relies heavily on [quantitative trading](../q/quantitative_trading.md) strategies, Jane Street presumably uses statistical measures, including the 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md), in their models. Jane Street
- **Renaissance Technologies**: Famous for their Medallion [Fund](../f/fund.md), Renaissance Technologies employs complex [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) that likely incorporate the 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) among other statistical tools. Renaissance Technologies

## Conclusion

The 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) is an essential statistical measure widely used in the field of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). By understanding and applying the concept of 2-[standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md), traders can identify potential trading opportunities, manage [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively, and develop [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). As the landscape of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) continues to evolve, the application of such statistical tools [will](../w/will.md) remain pivotal in the pursuit of trading [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and profitability.
