# 90-Day Letter

## Introduction
A 90-Day Letter, also referred to as a Notice of Deficiency, is a significant document issued by the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) in the United States. It represents a formal notification that the IRS believes you owe additional [taxes](../t/taxes.md). This letter is a crucial part of the tax assessment and dispute process, giving the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) a 90-day window to contest the IRS's determination in the U.S. Tax Court before the IRS can proceed with collecting the alleged deficiency.

## What is a 90-Day Letter?
A 90-Day Letter is a document sent by the IRS to taxpayers indicating a deficiency in their [tax return](../t/tax_return.md). The IRS issues this letter after conducting an audit and determining that the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) owes more [money](../m/money.md) than initially reported.

### Key Aspects of a 90-Day Letter
1. **Formal Notice**: The 90-Day Letter serves as an official notice, starting a legal countdown for taxpayers to respond.
2. **Deficiency Details**: The letter includes detailed information on the perceived deficiency, reasons why the IRS believes additional [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are owed, and the exact amount.
3. **Legal Right to Dispute**: This letter informs the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) of their right to petition the U.S. Tax Court within 90 days to contest the IRS’s findings.
4. **Statutory Notice**: It acts as a statutory notice of deficiency under Section 6212 of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code.

## Process Leading to a 90-Day Letter
1. **[Tax Return](../t/tax_return.md) Submission**: Taxpayers submit their tax returns annually.
2. **IRS Review**: The IRS selects certain returns for examination or audit.
3. **Audit**: During an audit, the IRS reviews the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)’s records and may request additional information.
4. **Preliminary Finding**: If discrepancies are found, the IRS may propose changes and ask for the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)’s agreement.
5. **Notice of Deficiency**: If the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) disagrees or fails to respond, the IRS issues a 90-Day Letter.

### Common Reasons for Receiving a 90-Day Letter
- Underreported [income](../i/income.md)
- Disallowed deductions or credits
- Mathematical or clerical errors
- Information discrepancies

## Actions to Take Upon Receiving a 90-Day Letter
1. **Read Carefully**: Thoroughly read the letter to understand the alleged deficiency and the IRS’s rationale.
2. **Consult a Tax Professional**: Seek advice from a tax professional or an attorney specializing in tax law to understand your [options](../o/options.md) and the potential impact.
3. **Gather Documentation**: Collect and organize all relevant documentation to support your case if you plan to contest the IRS’s findings.
4. **Respond Promptly**: Take timely action within the 90-day window to either agree, pay, or file a petition with the U.S. Tax Court.

### Options for Responding
- **Agree and Pay**: If you agree with the IRS’s findings, you can pay the deficiency to avoid further penalties and [interest](../i/interest.md).
- **Disagree and Petition**: If you disagree, you can file a petition with the U.S. Tax Court within the 90-day window.

## Petitioning the U.S. Tax Court
### Steps to Follow:
1. **Prepare the Petition**: Carefully prepare the petition, outlining your disagreement with the IRS’s findings.
2. **File the Petition**: Submit the petition to the U.S. Tax Court within the 90-day period.
3. **Litigation or Settlement**: Engage in litigation or settlement negotiations with the IRS. During this period, the IRS cannot proceed with collection actions related to the disputed amount.

### Benefits of Petitioning
- **Delay Collection**: Filing a petition delays IRS collection activities until the case is resolved.
- **Potential Settlement**: Tax Court proceedings might result in a settlement or a reduction of the deficiency.
- **Fair Hearing**: Provides an opportunity to present your case before an independent judicial body.

## Consequences of Inaction
Failing to respond to a 90-Day Letter can have severe financial and legal repercussions. Here are some possible outcomes:
- **Assessment of Deficiency**: The IRS [will](../w/will.md) assess the proposed deficiency and begin collection actions.
- **Liens and Levies**: The IRS may place liens on your property or [issue](../i/issue.md) levies to seize assets.
- **Increased [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Additional penalties and [interest](../i/interest.md) [accrue](../a/accrue.md) on the unpaid amount.

### Importance of the 90-Day Window
The 90-day timeframe is [non-negotiable](../n/non-negotiable.md) and strictly enforced. Missing this deadline means losing the right to dispute the deficiency in Tax Court, severely limiting your [options](../o/options.md).

## Conclusion
A 90-Day Letter represents a critical juncture in the tax dispute process. Understanding its significance, the [options](../o/options.md) available, and the necessity of a timely response can help taxpayers navigate this challenge effectively. Seeking professional [guidance](../g/guidance.md) and taking prompt action can make a considerable difference in resolving tax disputes favorably.
