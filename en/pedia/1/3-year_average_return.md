# 3-Year Average Return

The 3-year [average return](../a/average_return.md) is a financial metric that serves as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the performance of an investment or portfolio over a three-year period. Specifically, it averages the annual returns generated over this timeline. This calculation is essential for investors looking to evaluate the longer-term stability and viability of an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), like [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (often abbreviated as "algo trading").

### Importance of 3-Year Average Return

1. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment**: One of the main advantages of the 3-year [average return](../a/average_return.md) is its ability to reflect the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with an investment. While short-term returns might be influenced by temporary [market](../m/market.md) conditions, a 3-year period provides a more stable and reliable perspective.

2. **[Performance Benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md)**: Investors frequently use the 3-year [average return](../a/average_return.md) to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) performance against other investments or [market](../m/market.md) indices. Consistently outperforming a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) over three years can indicate a successful [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

### Calculation of 3-Year Average Return

The formula for calculating the 3-Year [Average Return](../a/average_return.md) is straightforward:

\[ \text{3-Year [Average Return](../a/average_return.md)} = \left( \frac{\left((1 + R_1) \times (1 + R_2) \times (1 + R_3)\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1}{1} \right) \times 100 \]

Where \( R_1 \), \( R_2 \), and \( R_3 \) are the returns for each of the three years, expressed as decimals.

Example:

- Year 1 [Return](../r/return.md): 10% (0.10)
- Year 2 [Return](../r/return.md): 7% (0.07)
- Year 3 [Return](../r/return.md): 12% (0.12)

\[ \text{3-Year [Average Return](../a/average_return.md)} = \left( \frac{(1.10 \times 1.07 \times 1.12)^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1}{1} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.33884^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1}{1} \right) \times 100 \approx 9.68\% \]

### Application in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves the use of computer algorithms to perform trading decisions based on pre-set rules. The 3-year [average return](../a/average_return.md) can play a critical role in:

1. **Strategy Evaluation**: Algorithms need to be back-tested over extended periods to ensure that they are not simply optimized for short-term performance. The 3-year [average return](../a/average_return.md) metric helps in evaluating how well a trading algorithm performs over a meaningful period.

2. **[Portfolio Management](../p/portfolio_management.md)**: Investors and [fund](../f/fund.md) managers rely on the 3-year [average return](../a/average_return.md) to manage a diversified portfolio of algorithmic strategies. This helps in understanding the combined performance and [risk](../r/risk.md) profile.

### Examples of Algorithmic Trading Firms Using 3-Year Average Return Metrics

1. **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)** (https://www.[quantconnect](../q/quantconnect.md).com): [QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) offers a platform for designing and testing [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies. The 3-year [average return](../a/average_return.md) is one of the [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) available for evaluating strategies in their [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) environment.

2. **Two Sigma** (https://www.twosigma.com): Two Sigma is a technology-driven quantitative investment [firm](../f/firm.md) that employs [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies. The [firm](../f/firm.md) focuses on using [data science](../d/data_science_in_trading.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) to generate sustained returns, often measured over multi-year periods including the 3-year [average return](../a/average_return.md).

3. **[Alpaca](../a/alpaca.md)** (https://[alpaca](../a/alpaca.md).markets): [Alpaca](../a/alpaca.md) is a [commission](../c/commission.md)-free [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) that offers API access for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Evaluating the 3-year [average return](../a/average_return.md) of different algorithmic strategies is crucial for users of the platform to make informed investment decisions.

### Conclusion

The 3-year [average return](../a/average_return.md) is a vital metric for evaluating the long-term performance and stability of investments, particularly in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It allows investors to gauge the effectiveness of their strategies beyond short-term fluctuations, providing a more comprehensive understanding of potential risks and returns. By integrating this metric into their evaluation processes, traders can make more informed decisions and optimize their [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies for sustained success.
