# 10-Bagger

In the realm of [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) [investing](../i/investing.md), the term "10-bagger" was popularized by famed [investor](../i/investor.md) Peter Lynch in his seminal book, "One Up On [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md)." A "10-bagger" is a stock that grows to be worth ten times its initial purchase price. The term borrows from baseball terminology, where a "bag" refers to a base, implying the stock has made it "ten bases" or tenfold its original [value](../v/value.md).

Investors seek 10-baggers due to their potential for significant [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation. Identifying these [stocks](../s/stock.md) early can lead to substantial financial gains and is often considered the "holy grail" for growth investors.
