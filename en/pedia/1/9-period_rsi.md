# 9-Period RSI

The 9-period [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) is a popular [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) used to measure the strength and [momentum](../m/momentum.md) of price movements in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his book "New Concepts in Technical [Trading Systems](../t/trading_systems.md)" in 1978. While the traditional RSI calculation uses a 14-period [default](../d/default.md), the 9-period RSI is a shorter-term variation that some traders prefer for quicker signals and increased sensitivity to price changes.

## How RSI is Calculated

RSI is calculated using the following formula:

\[ RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + RS} \right) \]

Where:

\[ RS = \frac{\text{average [gain](../g/gain.md) over the specified period}}{\text{average loss over the specified period}} \]

In the context of the 9-period RSI, the calculation would focus on the average gains and losses over a 9-period timeframe.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Calculate the change in price:** For each period from 1 to 9, the change in price ([delta](../d/delta.md)) is calculated.

2. **Separate gains and losses:** Identify which periods have gains (price increase) and losses (price decrease).

3. **Calculate the average [gain](../g/gain.md) and average loss:** Sum the gains over the past 9 periods and divide by 9. Do the same for the losses.

4. **Calculate [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md) (RS):** Divide the average [gain](../g/gain.md) by the average loss.

5. **Calculate the RSI:** Plug the RS [value](../v/value.md) into the RSI formula to get the final RSI [value](../v/value.md).

## Interpretation of the 9-Period RSI

### Overbought and Oversold Conditions

- **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md):** An RSI reading above 70 is traditionally interpreted as [overbought](../o/overbought.md), indicating that the [asset](../a/asset.md) might be [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) and a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) or [pullback](../p/pullback.md) could be imminent.

- **[Oversold](../o/oversold.md):** An RSI reading below 30 indicates [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions, suggesting that the [asset](../a/asset.md) might be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) and a bounce-back could occur soon.

### Divergences

- **[Bullish Divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md):** Occurs when the price makes a new low, but the RSI does not. This can be an early sign of a potential upward [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

- **[Bearish Divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md):** Happens when the price makes a new high, but the RSI does not correspondingly increase. This may signal an impending downward [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

## Benefits of Using the 9-Period RSI

1. **Increased Sensitivity:** The 9-period RSI provides more frequent signals compared to the longer 14-period RSI. This is beneficial for traders who wish to make faster decisions based on recent price movements.

2. **Early Entry and Exit Points:** The shorter period can help traders identify entry and exit points more quickly, which can be advantageous in volatile markets or when quick trading is required.

3. **[Scalping](../s/scalping.md) and [Day Trading](../d/day_trading.md):** For scalpers and day traders who usually [hold](../h/hold.md) positions for short periods, the 9-period RSI offers timely signals that can match their fast-paced trading style.

## Limitations of the 9-Period RSI

1. **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md):** The increased sensitivity can also lead to more [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md). These can result in premature entries and exits, causing potential losses.

2. **[Noise](../n/noise.md):** In highly volatile markets, the shorter RSI can produce a lot of [noise](../n/noise.md), making it difficult to distinguish between significant and insignificant price movements.

3. **Lag:** Like all indicators, the RSI is based on past price data and may lag behind actual [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This means that it may sometimes provide signals too late.

## Practical Applications

### Swing Trading

Swing traders can use the 9-period RSI to identify short-term [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions. For example, if a stock's 9-period RSI goes above 70, a swing [trader](../t/trader.md) might take this as a signal to look for selling opportunities or tighten [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md).

### Trend Following

In trending markets, the 9-period RSI can help traders confirm the strength of a [trend](../t/trend.md). For instance, during a strong [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), RSI might frequently touch [overbought](../o/overbought.md) levels without necessarily indicating an imminent [reversal](../r/reversal.md). Here, the RSI helps in understanding the enduring strength of the [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Combining with Other Indicators

Many traders use the 9-period RSI in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to enhance the accuracy of their signals. Moving averages, MACD, and [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) are commonly paired with RSI to filter out [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) and confirm trends.

## Companies Utilizing RSI in Trading Systems

Several [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms and financial service companies integrate RSI into their [trading models](../t/trading_models.md) and algorithms. Here are a few examples:

1. **Bridgewater Associates LLP** — One of the largest and most renowned [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, they use a blend of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), including RSI, in their investment strategies.

2. **Two Sigma** — Actively incorporates [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), including RSI, in their [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

3. **Jane Street [Capital](../c/capital.md)** — Utilizes a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) as part of their [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies, likely including RSI for various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

4. **Renaissance Technologies** — Known for their Medallion [Fund](../f/fund.md), they use sophisticated [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md), including RSI, to exploit [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies.

## Case Study: Application of 9-Period RSI

### Scenario: Stock XYZ in a Sideways Market

#### Background
Stock XYZ has been trading within a tight [range](../r/range.md) for the past few weeks. Daily [volatility](../v/volatility.md) is moderate, and the stock lacks a clear major [trend](../t/trend.md). A [trader](../t/trader.md) decides to apply the 9-period RSI to take advantage of the price movements within this [range](../r/range.md).

#### Analysis
The 9-period RSI helps the [trader](../t/trader.md) identify short-term [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions within the [range](../r/range.md).

1. **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md):** On [multiple](../m/multiple.md) occasions, the RSI crosses above 70, indicating [overbought](../o/overbought.md) conditions. The [trader](../t/trader.md) uses this as a signal to short the stock or exit long positions.

2. **[Oversold](../o/oversold.md):** Conversely, whenever the RSI falls below 30, it signals [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions. The [trader](../t/trader.md) takes these points as opportunities to go long or cover short positions.

#### Execution
Using the 9-period RSI, the [trader](../t/trader.md) executes several successful trades, profiting from the micro-fluctuations within the trading [range](../r/range.md). By constantly monitoring the RSI, the [trader](../t/trader.md) is able to navigate the sideways [market](../m/market.md) effectively.

## Conclusion

The 9-period RSI is a versatile and widely used technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that offers traders increased sensitivity to price changes, making it suitable for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) strategies such as [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) and [scalping](../s/scalping.md). While it has its limitations, such as the potential for [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), its benefits make it a valuable tool in a [trader](../t/trader.md)’s arsenal. By understanding and applying the 9-period RSI, traders can [gain](../g/gain.md) valuable insights into [market](../m/market.md) conditions and enhance their trading decisions.
