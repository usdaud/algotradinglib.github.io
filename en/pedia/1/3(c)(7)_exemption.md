# 3(c)(7) Exemption

The 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) is a [provision](../p/provision.md) under the [Investment Company Act of 1940](../i/investment_company_act_of_1940.md), which allows certain investment funds to be exempt from registering with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). Specifically, it pertains to investment funds that are exclusively offered to “qualified purchasers.” This [exemption](../e/exemption.md) is a crucial tool for [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds, and other private funds as it allows them to avoid the rigorous regulatory and reporting requirements applied to public funds.

## Qualified Purchasers

Under the 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md), an [investment fund](../i/investment_fund.md) can be exempt from registration if it restricts its investors to "qualified purchasers." The term “qualified purchaser” is defined in Section 2(a)(51) of the [Investment Company Act of 1940](../i/investment_company_act_of_1940.md). Generally, a qualified purchaser includes:

1. **Individuals or Families:** Natural persons (and certain family corporations, partnerships, estates, and trusts) who own not less than $5 million in investments.
2. **Institutions:** Institutions such as corporations or partnerships that own and invest on a discretionary [basis](../b/basis.md) not less than $25 million in investments.
3. **Entities Owned by Qualified Purchasers:** Entities in which all beneficial owners are qualified purchasers.

Meeting these thresholds confirms that the investors have sufficient sophistication and financial wherewithal to understand and bear the risks associated with high-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments.

## Key Advantages

### Regulatory Relief

The primary advantage of the 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) is regulatory relief. Funds using this [exemption](../e/exemption.md) are not required to register with the SEC. Consequently, they are not subject to the same level of scrutiny, oversight, and reporting requirements as registered investment companies, such as mutual funds. This allows more operational flexibility and reduced administrative costs.

### Marketing and Operational Flexibility

Funds exempt under 3(c)(7) can engage in more aggressive and sophisticated investment strategies that may not be permissible for registered investment companies. They also have greater latitude in [marketing](../m/marketing.md) their [fund](../f/fund.md) to qualified purchasers, as they are not subject to the same public [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements.

### Scalability

Unlike the 3(c)(1) [exemption](../e/exemption.md), which limits the number of investors to 100, the 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) has no maximum number of investors, as long as all are qualified purchasers. This lack of a cap allows these funds to raise large amounts of [capital](../c/capital.md) from a broader [investor](../i/investor.md) base, which can enhance [scalability](../s/scalability.md) and [fund](../f/fund.md) growth.

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

Despite the reduced regulatory burden, funds employing the 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) must still navigate complex legal and compliance issues. Key considerations include:

### Anti-Fraud Provisions

Funds must comply with federal anti-[fraud](../f/fraud.md) provisions, specifically those under the [Securities Act of 1933](../s/securities_act_of_1933.md) and the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md). This means they are still subject to regulations that prohibit deceptive practices, including false or misleading statements to investors.

### Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Regulations

Even though 3(c)(7) funds are exempt from some SEC requirements, they must comply with KYC and AML regulations to prevent illicit activities such as [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) and [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Investor Verification

To maintain their [exemption](../e/exemption.md) status, funds must rigorously verify that each [investor](../i/investor.md) qualifies as a "qualified purchaser." This verification process often involves comprehensive [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md), including reviewing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and other relevant documents to confirm investment assets.

### Disclosure Requirements

While not as extensive as those for registered funds, 3(c)(7) funds must provide certain disclosures to their investors. This generally includes [private placement](../p/private_placement.md) memorandums, [offering](../o/offering.md) circulars, and other documents that detail the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s strategies, risks, fees, and governance.

## Comparison with 3(c)(1) Exemption

Understanding the nuances between the 3(c)(7) and 3(c)(1) exemptions is crucial for [fund](../f/fund.md) managers deciding on the best structure for regulatory compliance.

### Investor Limits

As mentioned earlier, the 3(c)(1) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) limits the number of investors to 100, irrespective of their financial status. In contrast, 3(c)(7) has no such limit, provided all investors are qualified purchasers.

### Investor Qualifications

The 3(c)(1) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) requires investors to be “accredited investors” as per the definitions in Regulation D of the [Securities Act of 1933](../s/securities_act_of_1933.md), generally meaning individuals with a [net worth](../n/net_worth.md) of over $1 million or annual [income](../i/income.md) exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 for couples). The 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) requires the more stringent criterion of "qualified purchasers."

### Use Cases

Typically, smaller [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, [venture capital funds](../v/venture_capital_funds.md), or [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds that do not expect to have more than 100 investors may opt for the 3(c)(1) [exemption](../e/exemption.md). In contrast, larger funds looking to raise significant [capital](../c/capital.md) from a wide [range](../r/range.md) of sophisticated investors typically utilize the 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md).

## Case Studies

### Bridgewater Associates

Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds in the world, initially relied on the 3(c)(1) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) but transitioned to utilizing exemptions under 3(c)(7) to accommodate a growing number of sophisticated investors who met the qualified purchaser criteria. Their scale and operational complexity necessitated the flexibility provided by the 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md).

### The Blackstone Group

The Blackstone Group utilizes the 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) for many of its [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) funds, allowing them to raise large pools of [capital](../c/capital.md) from a diverse array of institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. By adhering to the qualifications and regulations under 3(c)(7), Blackstone can effectively manage numerous investors while capitalizing on higher flexibility in their investment strategies.

## Conclusion

The 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) is a powerful tool that provides significant advantages to private investment funds seeking to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) from sophisticated investors without the burden of SEC registration. However, it comes with its own set of challenges and compliance requirements that [fund](../f/fund.md) managers must navigate carefully. By understanding the intricacies of the 3(c)(7) [exemption](../e/exemption.md), [fund](../f/fund.md) managers can better position their funds for success in the competitive and regulated landscape of private [investing](../i/investing.md).
