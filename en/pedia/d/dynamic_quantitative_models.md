# Dynamic Quantitative Models

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or "algo trading," involves the use of computer algorithms to automatically execute trading orders in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These algorithms are developed using [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) that analyze historical data, optimize [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), and manage [risk](../r/risk.md). Dynamic [Quantitative Models](../q/quantitative_models.md) (DQMs) are a subclass of these algorithms that adapt to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions in real-time, providing a [robust](../r/robust.md) and dynamic framework for decision-making.

## Introduction to Dynamic Quantitative Models

Dynamic [Quantitative Models](../q/quantitative_models.md) employ statistical techniques and mathematical theories to forecast price movements and optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Unlike static models, which rely on fixed parameters and historical data, DQMs adjust their parameters in response to real-time data, ensuring higher adaptability and resilience in volatile markets. The dynamic nature of these models allows them to better capture [market](../m/market.md) trends and anomalies, thus improving [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md).

### Components of Dynamic Quantitative Models

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
