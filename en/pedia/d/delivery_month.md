# Delivery Month

The delivery month is the month in which a futures contract can be physically settled or cash settled. It defines the contract's expiration schedule and trading activity.

## Importance
- Determines when the contract stops trading
- Affects liquidity as volume shifts to the next contract
- Drives roll schedules for systematic strategies

## Trading Considerations
Traders typically move positions to the next contract before the delivery month to avoid delivery obligations and liquidity drops. The roll period is often defined by volume or open interest shifts.

## Calendar Effects
Front month contracts often have higher liquidity until the roll window begins. After that, spreads can widen and price behavior can change.

## Risk and Compliance
Holding into delivery month can result in unwanted physical delivery or unusual price behavior due to delivery mechanics. Understanding contract specifications is essential.

## Best Practices
Track first notice day, last trading day, and exchange holiday schedules. Automated alerts reduce operational errors during roll periods.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
