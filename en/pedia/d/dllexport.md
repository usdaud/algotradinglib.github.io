# DllExport

**DllExport** is a system utility designed to export functions from .NET assemblies as native DLL exports. By providing a bridge between managed (.NET) code and native applications, DllExport enables seamless integration of modern trading platforms (such as [StockSharp](../s/stocksharp.md), Tiger.Trade or [Lean](../q/quantconnect.md)) with legacy systems like [MetaTrader 4 (MT4)](../m/metatrader4.md) and [MetaTrader 5 (MT5)](../m/metatrader5.md).

### Key Components

1. **Managed-to-Native Exporting:** 
   DllExport allows developers to mark methods in a .NET assembly so that they are exported as native functions. This means that these functions can be called from non-.NET applications that require native DLL interfaces.

2. **Compiler Integration:** 
   The tool integrates with the build process to automatically generate the necessary export symbols. It ensures that the .NET methods are properly exposed as native exports during compilation.

3. **Interoperability Layer:** 
   By providing a standard mechanism for exporting functions, DllExport acts as an interoperability layer, allowing modern .NET-based trading libraries to communicate with and extend legacy trading software.

### Applications

- **Integration with Legacy Trading Platforms:** 
  Financial institutions and independent developers can integrate modern, feature-rich trading applications like [StockSharp](../s/stocksharp.md) or Lean with well-established legacy platforms such as [MT4](../m/metatrader4.md) and [MT5](../m/metatrader5.md). This integration allows traders to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) modern analytical tools while maintaining compatibility with widely used legacy systems.

- **Enhancing Functionality of Legacy Systems:** 
  Using DllExport, legacy systems can be extended with advanced functionality developed in modern languages. This is particularly useful for incorporating new algorithms, data feeds, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) features into older platforms.

- **Seamless Interoperability:** 
  Developers can create hybrid solutions where modern managed code handles complex logic or data processing, and native legacy applications maintain their familiar user interfaces and connectivity with traditional trading networks.

### Advantages

- **Cost-Effective Modernization:** 
  DllExport offers a cost-effective way to modernize legacy [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) by enabling them to use state-of-the-art .NET libraries without the need to completely replace existing platforms.

- **Increased Flexibility:** 
  By bridging managed and native code, it provides developers with the flexibility to choose the best tools and frameworks for each part of their system, integrating advanced features with time-tested legacy [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).

- **Enhanced Performance:** 
  With native DLL exports, integration is efficient and avoids the overhead associated with inter-process communication, ensuring responsive performance in real-time trading environments.

### Challenges

- **Complex Build Integration:** 
  Setting up DllExport requires careful configuration of the build process. Developers must ensure that export declarations and build scripts are correctly configured to generate native exports.

- **Compatibility Issues:** 
  Ensuring compatibility between .NET-managed code and legacy native systems can be challenging, particularly when dealing with differences in data types and calling conventions.

- **Maintenance Overhead:** 
  As both modern and legacy systems evolve, maintaining a seamless integration layer can require ongoing updates and troubleshooting to ensure that interfaces remain stable and secure.

### Future Outlook

As the financial technology landscape continues to evolve, tools like DllExport will play a crucial role in bridging the gap between new and legacy systems. Future developments may focus on further simplifying the integration process, improving compatibility across various platforms, and enhancing [security](../s/security.md). These advancements [will](../w/will.md) help ensure that legacy trading platforms can continue to benefit from modern innovations, providing traders with cutting-edge tools without sacrificing the reliability of established systems.
