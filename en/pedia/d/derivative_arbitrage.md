# Derivative Arbitrage

[Derivative](../d/derivative.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is a sophisticated [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that aims to take advantage of pricing inefficiencies between related financial instruments in the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md). [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial contracts whose [value](../v/value.md) is derived from the performance of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, commodities, currencies, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, or [market](../m/market.md) indexes. Various types of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) include [futures](../f/futures.md), [options](../o/options.md), swaps, and [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md). [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities arise when these instruments are mispriced relative to each other or to the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets they track.

## Types of Derivative Arbitrage

### 1. Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

Cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking advantage of the price difference between the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [spot market](../s/spot_market.md). This strategy typically involves the following steps:
1. **Buying the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) in the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md).**
2. **Simultaneously selling a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) on the same [asset](../a/asset.md).**

The goal is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the difference between the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) and the [futures](../f/futures.md) price after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for carrying costs (such as storage costs, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and dividends). If the [futures](../f/futures.md) price is sufficiently higher than the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) plus the carrying costs, the [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md) locks in a riskless [profit](../p/profit.md).

### 2. Reverse Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

Reverse cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is the inverse of the cash-and-carry strategy and involves taking advantage of a situation where the [futures](../f/futures.md) price is lower than the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) minus the carrying costs. The steps are:
1. **[Short selling](../s/short_selling.md) the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) in the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md).**
2. **Simultaneously buying a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) on the same [asset](../a/asset.md).**

The [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md) profits from the difference between the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) and the [futures](../f/futures.md) price after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for carrying costs. This strategy is used when the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) is trading at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md).

### 3. Convertible Arbitrage

Convertible [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves trading between convertible securities (such as convertible bonds) and their [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). Convertible bonds can be converted into a predetermined number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of the issuing company’s [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). The [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategy typically involves:
1. **Buying the [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md).**
2. **Simultaneously [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock.**

The objective is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the mispricing between the [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock, with the added benefit of capturing [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) from the [bond](../b/bond.md).

### 4. Option Arbitrage

Option [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) seeks to exploit inconsistencies in the pricing of [options](../o/options.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. There are several option [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies:

#### Box Spread Arbitrage
A [box spread](../b/box_spread.md) is an [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategy that involves creating a combination of [bull](../b/bull.md) and bear [spreads](../s/spreads.md) using call and [put options](../p/put_options.md). The [box spread](../b/box_spread.md) typically involves:
1. **Buying a [bull call spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md) (buying a lower strike [call option](../c/call_option.md) and selling a higher strike [call option](../c/call_option.md)).**
2. **Buying a [bear put spread](../b/bear_put_spread.md) (buying a higher strike [put option](../p/put.md) and selling a lower strike [put option](../p/put.md)).**

If the combined cost of establishing the [box spread](../b/box_spread.md) is less than the difference in strike prices (adjusted for the [present value](../p/present_value.md)), an [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunity exists.

#### Calendar Spread Arbitrage
Calendar spread [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) exploits mispricing between [options](../o/options.md) with different expiration dates but the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). The strategy involves:
1. **Buying a longer-term option.**
2. **Simultaneously selling a shorter-term option.**

The expectation is that the [options](../o/options.md) [will](../w/will.md) converge in [value](../v/value.md) as expiration approaches, and the [trader](../t/trader.md) profits from this convergence.

## Risks and Challenges of Derivative Arbitrage

### Execution Risk
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies often require executing [multiple](../m/multiple.md) transactions simultaneously. Delays or failures in executing these transactions can erode potential profits.

### Liquidity Risk
[Derivative](../d/derivative.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) relies on the ability to buy and sell [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets or [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) without significantly impacting prices. A lack of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can make it difficult to enter or exit positions at desired prices.

### Model Risk
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies often rely on complex [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) to identify mispricing. Errors in these models can lead to incorrect trading decisions and losses.

### Counterparty Risk
[Derivative](../d/derivative.md) transactions often involve counterparties, such as brokers or [clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses. If a [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) fails to fulfill their [obligations](../o/obligation.md), it can result in losses for the [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md).

### Regulatory Risk
Changes in regulations or [market](../m/market.md) practices can affect the availability of [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities. For example, restrictions on [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) or changes in [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements can impact the effectiveness of certain [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies.
