# Demand Curve

## Introduction
The [demand](../d/demand.md) curve is a fundamental concept in [economics](../e/economics.md) that illustrates the relationship between the price of a good or service and the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) by consumers over a specified period. This concept is pivotal in understanding [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) and consumer behavior.

## Definition
The [demand](../d/demand.md) curve is a graphical representation that shows how the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) of a [commodity](../c/commodity.md) changes as its price changes. It typically slopes downwards from left to right, indicating that as the price decreases, the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) increases, and vice versa. This negative relationship between price and [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) embodies the [law of demand](../l/law_of_demand.md).

## Law of Demand
The [law of demand](../l/law_of_demand.md) states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good or service falls, the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) rises, and as the price rises, the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) falls. The law is based on the principle of diminishing [marginal utility](../m/marginal_utility.md), which suggests that as consumers consume more units of a good, the additional satisfaction gained from consuming an additional unit diminishes. Therefore, lower prices are required to incentivize consumers to purchase additional quantities.

## Determinants of Demand
Several factors other than the price influence the [demand](../d/demand.md) for a good or service. These factors can cause the [demand](../d/demand.md) curve to shift, rather than move along the curve.

### Income
As consumer [income](../i/income.md) increases, the [demand](../d/demand.md) for normal goods tends to increase, shifting the [demand](../d/demand.md) curve to the right. Conversely, for [inferior goods](../i/inferior_goods.md), the [demand](../d/demand.md) decreases with an increase in [income](../i/income.md).

### Preferences and Tastes
Changes in consumer preferences and tastes, influenced by trends, advertising, or changes in circumstances (e.g., health information), can increase or decrease [demand](../d/demand.md), shifting the curve to the right or left.

### Prices of Related Goods
The [demand](../d/demand.md) for a good can be affected by the prices of related goods. These can be substitutes or complements:
- **Substitutes:** If the price of a [substitute](../s/substitute.md) good rises, the [demand](../d/demand.md) for the good in question increases, shifting the [demand](../d/demand.md) curve to the right.
- **Complements:** If the price of a [complement](../c/complement.md) good rises, the [demand](../d/demand.md) for the good in question decreases, shifting the [demand](../d/demand.md) curve to the left.

### Expectations
Expectations about future prices, [income](../i/income.md), and availability can affect current [demand](../d/demand.md). For instance, if consumers expect prices to rise in the future, they might buy more now, increasing present [demand](../d/demand.md).

### Number of Buyers
An increase in the number of buyers in the [market](../m/market.md) increases [demand](../d/demand.md), shifting the [demand](../d/demand.md) curve to the right, and a decrease in the number of buyers shifts it to the left.

## Shifts vs. Movements Along the Demand Curve
- **Movements along the curve:** These occur when the price of the good itself changes. A movement up or down the curve represents an increase or decrease in the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) in response to a price change.
- **Shifts in the curve:** These occur when one of the determinants of [demand](../d/demand.md) other than the price changes. A shift to the right represents an increase in [demand](../d/demand.md) at all price levels, while a shift to the left represents a decrease.

## Mathematical Representation
The [demand](../d/demand.md) curve can be expressed as:
\[ Q_d = f(P) \]
where \( Q_d \) is the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) and \( P \) is the price. This can be further specified in a linear form:
\[ Q_d = a - bP \]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. \( a \) represents the intercept, and \( b \) shows the slope of the [demand](../d/demand.md) curve.

## Elasticity of Demand
[Elasticity](../e/elasticity.md) measures how responsive [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) is to a change in price. It is defined as:
\[ \text{[Price Elasticity of Demand](../p/price_elasticity_of_demand.md)} (E_d) = \frac{\% \text{Change in [Quantity Demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md)}}{\% \text{Change in Price}} \]
- **[Elastic](../e/elastic.md) [Demand](../d/demand.md):** \( |E_d| > 1 \) ([quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) changes more than the price)
- **Inelastic [Demand](../d/demand.md):** \( |E_d| < 1 \) ([quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) changes less than the price)
- **Unitary [Elastic](../e/elastic.md) [Demand](../d/demand.md):** \( |E_d| = 1 \) ([quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) changes exactly the same as the price)

## Derivation from Utility
The [demand](../d/demand.md) curve can also be derived from [utility maximization](../u/utility_maximization.md). Assuming consumers aim to maximize their [utility](../u/utility.md) subject to their [budget](../b/budget.md) constraint, the [demand](../d/demand.md) curve can be arrived at through the following steps:
1. **[Utility](../u/utility.md) Function:** Define the [utility](../u/utility.md) function, \( U(X) \), where \( X \) is the bundle of goods.
2. **[Budget](../b/budget.md) Constraint:** Define the [budget](../b/budget.md) constraint, \( P_X X + P_Y Y = M \), where \( P_X \) and \( P_Y \) are prices of goods \( X \) and \( Y \), respectively, and \( M \) is the [income](../i/income.md).
3. **Optimal Consumption:** Using the Lagrangian [multiplier](../m/multiplier.md) method to solve for the optimal consumption bundle.
4. **[Demand](../d/demand.md) Function:** The derived function showing how quantities demanded depend on prices and [income](../i/income.md).

## Applications
Understanding the [demand](../d/demand.md) curve is essential in various fields, including but not limited to:
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Analysis:** Helps firms predict reactions to price changes.
- **Policy Making:** Assists governments in understanding how [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or subsidies influence consumer behavior.
- **[Business](../b/business.md) Strategy:** Guides businesses in pricing strategies to maximize revenues.

## Real-World Example
Consider the tech giant Apple Inc. When Apple launches a new iPhone, it sets a high initial price, and [demand](../d/demand.md) might initially be limited to early adopters. Over time, as the price decreases, the [demand](../d/demand.md) increases, reflecting movement along the [demand](../d/demand.md) curve. Moreover, if a major competitor releases a superior alternative, the [demand](../d/demand.md) for the iPhone may decrease, shifting the [demand](../d/demand.md) curve to the left.

## Conclusion
The [demand](../d/demand.md) curve is a cornerstone of economic theory that aids in understanding consumer behavior and [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). By analyzing how the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) of a good changes with its price and other factors, businesses and policymakers can make informed decisions to achieve specific economic objectives.
