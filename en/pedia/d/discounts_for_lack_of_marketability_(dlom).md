# Discounts For Lack Of Marketability (DLOM)

Discounts for Lack of Marketability (DLOM) is an important yet complex concept in [valuation](../v/valuation.md), especially when it comes to valuing private companies or non-publicly traded [shares](../s/shares.md). The DLOM represents the reduction in [value](../v/value.md) due to the inability to quickly sell or [market](../m/market.md) the [asset](../a/asset.md), usually because it is not traded on a public [exchange](../e/exchange.md). In this comprehensive examination, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into the importance, methodology, application, and criticism of DLOM in [valuation](../v/valuation.md).

## Importance of DLOM

Understanding DLOM is critical for various stakeholders, including investors, [business](../b/business.md) owners, financial analysts, and legal professionals:

- **Investors**: Investors may want to know the DLOM to assess the viability and true [value](../v/value.md) of [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) investments.
- **[Business](../b/business.md) Owners**: [Business](../b/business.md) owners may need to apply DLOM when planning for [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) or exit strategies.
- **Financial Analysts**: Financial analysts use DLOM in [valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md) to provide a more accurate picture of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [market value](../m/market_value.md).
- **Legal Professionals**: Legal professionals might consider DLOM in divorce settlements, [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md), and disputes over company ownership.

## Factors Influencing DLOM

[Multiple](../m/multiple.md) factors can influence the DLOM, making it a nuanced and variable figure:

- **Size of the Company**: Smaller companies often face higher DLOMs due to limited resources and [market](../m/market.md) presence.
- **Profitability**: Companies with higher profitability may have lower DLOMs as they attract more [interest](../i/interest.md) from potential buyers.
- **Growth Prospects**: Firms with high growth potential might experience a reduced DLOM because of the anticipated future returns.
- **[Dividend Policy](../d/dividend_policy.md)**: Consistent [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments can lower the DLOM as they [offer](../o/offer.md) some [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to shareholders.

## Methodology

Determining the DLOM can be done through various methods, each with its own set of assumptions, advantages, and drawbacks:

### Empirical Models

Empirical models use historical data to estimate the DLOM by comparing public and private companies. These models include:

- **[Restricted Stock](../r/restricted_stock.md) Studies**: These studies compare the prices of restricted [shares](../s/shares.md), which cannot be sold immediately, with the prices of unrestricted [shares](../s/shares.md) of the same company.
- **[Pre-IPO](../p/pre-ipo.md) Studies**: These studies compare the prices at which private companies sell their [shares](../s/shares.md) shortly before [going public](../g/going_public.md) with the prices of their [shares](../s/shares.md) immediately after the IPO.

### Theoretical Models

Theoretical models employ financial theories to estimate DLOM, which include:

- **[Option Pricing Models](../o/option_pricing_models.md)**: These models, such as the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md), can estimate the DLOM by treating marketability as an option to sell.
- **Qualitative Models**: These models assess qualitative factors like company size, growth rate, and [dividend policy](../d/dividend_policy.md) to estimate the DLOM.

### Hybrid Models

Hybrid models combine aspects of both empirical and theoretical approaches to provide a more nuanced estimation:

- **Longstaff Model**: This model uses financial [options](../o/options.md) theory to estimate DLOM by considering the cost of hedging against marketability [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Finnerty Model**: A refinement of [restricted stock](../r/restricted_stock.md) studies, this model considers both the time frame and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the stock.

## Application in Valuation

DLOM finds its application in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) contexts, including but not limited to:

### Business Valuations

In [business valuations](../b/business_valuations.md), particularly for private and family-owned businesses, applying a DLOM provides a more accurate estimate of the company's worth. This is crucial for transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, where the [illiquidity](../i/illiquid.md) of non-public [shares](../s/shares.md) must be factored in.

### Estate Planning and Taxation

DLOM is often applied in [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) and gift [taxation](../t/taxation.md) to assess the fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) of [business](../b/business.md) interests or [shares](../s/shares.md) transferred within a family. The IRS guidelines also consider DLOM when evaluating assets.

### Divorce Settlements

During divorce proceedings, a [business](../b/business.md) might need to be valued to divide marital assets. Applying a DLOM ensures that the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) reflects the reduced marketability and, consequently, the fair division of assets.

### Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)

The [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) within an ESOP often includes a DLOM to account for the restricted nature of these [shares](../s/shares.md), which cannot be easily liquidated.

## Criticism and Controversies

Despite its widespread application, DLOM has faced several criticisms:

### Subjectivity

One of the primary criticisms is the subjectivity involved in estimating the DLOM. Different analysts may arrive at different estimates due to the wide [range](../r/range.md) of factors and models available.

### Lack of Transparency

Another criticism is the lack of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in how DLOM is calculated. Without clear guidelines, the process can appear arbitrary, raising questions about the reliability of the [valuation](../v/valuation.md).

### Market Dynamics

Markets and the factors influencing DLOM are dynamic. A model that worked well in one [market](../m/market.md) condition might not be applicable under different conditions, challenging the consistency of DLOM estimates.

### Legal Challenges

Due to its subjective nature, DLOM estimates are often challenged in courts, particularly in cases of divorce settlements and [estate](../e/estate.md) disputes. The lack of standardization can lead to contentious legal battles.

## Future Directions

Given the criticisms and complexities associated with DLOM, several advances are on the horizon to improve its accuracy:

### Technological Advancements

The use of [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) to analyze vast amounts of data can provide more refined estimations of DLOM. These technologies can identify patterns and correlations that might not be apparent through traditional methods.

### Regulatory Framework

There is a push for creating standardized regulatory frameworks to provide clear guidelines on estimating DLOM. Organizations like the IRS and [accounting](../a/accounting.md) bodies could play a pivotal role in this standardization.

### Continued Research

Ongoing academic and [industry](../i/industry.md) research can contribute to developing more [robust](../r/robust.md) models that take into account a wider [range](../r/range.md) of factors, improving the reliability of DLOM estimates.

## Conclusion

Discounts for Lack of Marketability (DLOM) play a crucial role in [valuation](../v/valuation.md) by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the [illiquidity](../i/illiquid.md) of private assets. While its application is widespread in [business valuations](../b/business_valuations.md), [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md), and legal contexts, it also faces criticism due to its subjective nature and lack of standardization. Nonetheless, advancements in technology, ongoing research, and potential regulatory frameworks [offer](../o/offer.md) promising avenues for refining DLOM estimates, making them more reliable and transparent for all stakeholders involved.
