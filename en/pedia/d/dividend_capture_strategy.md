# Dividend Capture Strategy

A dividend capture strategy aims to profit from dividends by buying a stock before the ex dividend date and selling it afterward. The goal is to collect the dividend while minimizing price risk.

## Basic Mechanics
- Buy shares before the ex dividend date
- Hold through the ex date
- Sell after the dividend is secured

## Price Behavior
Stock prices often drop by approximately the dividend amount on the ex date. The net gain depends on the size of the dividend relative to transaction costs and price movement.

## Practical Considerations
Dividend capture works better in liquid stocks with stable prices. Traders should account for settlement rules, tax treatment, and the timing of dividends.

## Risks
The strategy is exposed to market risk during the holding period. A broad market drop can overwhelm the dividend value.

## Limitations
The strategy is competitive and can be crowded. Market adjustments often remove the apparent advantage.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
