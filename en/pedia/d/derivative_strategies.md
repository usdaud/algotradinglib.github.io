# Derivative Strategies

[Derivative](../d/derivative.md) strategies are an integral part of modern [finance](../f/finance.md) and [quantitative trading](../q/quantitative_trading.md), providing investors and traders with tools to manage [risk](../r/risk.md), [leverage](../l/leverage.md) positions, and enhance returns. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial contracts whose [value](../v/value.md) is derived from the performance of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets, indices, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, or currencies. The main types of [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments include [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), forwards, and swaps. This article explores various [derivative](../d/derivative.md) strategies in detail, focusing on their applications, advantages, disadvantages, and [execution](../e/execution.md).

## Options Strategies

[Options](../o/options.md) are a versatile class of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that provide the holder with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price within a specified period.

### Covered Call

A [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) involves owning the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md) on the same [asset](../a/asset.md). This strategy generates [income](../i/income.md) from the [option premium](../o/option_premium.md) while providing some downside protection through the ownership of the [asset](../a/asset.md).

#### Mechanics
1. Purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
2. Sell call [options](../o/options.md) for those [shares](../s/shares.md).

#### Advantages
- Generates extra [income](../i/income.md) from the premiums.
- Provides limited downside protection.

#### Disadvantages
- Limits the [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md) if the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price increases significantly.
- Still exposes the [investor](../i/investor.md) to the [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Protective Put

A [protective put](../p/protective_put.md) involves holding a long position in an [asset](../a/asset.md) and buying a [put option](../p/put.md) on the same [asset](../a/asset.md). This strategy acts as an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy against a decline in the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price.

#### Mechanics
1. Purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
2. Buy [put options](../p/put_options.md) for those [shares](../s/shares.md).

#### Advantages
- Provides downside protection.
- Retains [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md).

#### Disadvantages
- Cost of purchasing [put options](../p/put_options.md).

### Spread Strategies

[Spreads](../s/spreads.md) involve taking positions in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [options](../o/options.md) of the same class (calls or puts) on the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) but with different strike prices or expiration dates.

#### Bull Call Spread

A [bull call spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md) is used when a moderate rise in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is expected. It involves buying a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and selling another [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
2. Sell a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

#### Advantages
- Reduces the cost of the long [call option](../c/call_option.md).
- Limits potential loss.

#### Disadvantages
- Caps potential [profit](../p/profit.md).

#### Bear Put Spread

A [bear put spread](../b/bear_put_spread.md) is used when a moderate decline in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is expected. It involves buying a [put option](../p/put.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and selling another [put option](../p/put.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a [put option](../p/put.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
2. Sell a [put option](../p/put.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

#### Advantages
- Reduces the cost of the long [put option](../p/put.md).
- Limits potential loss.

#### Disadvantages
- Caps potential [profit](../p/profit.md).

### Straddle

A [straddle](../s/straddle.md) involves buying both a [call option](../c/call_option.md) and a [put option](../p/put.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This strategy is used when a significant price movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is expected, but the direction is uncertain.

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a certain [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
2. Buy a [put option](../p/put.md) at the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

#### Advantages
- Profits from significant price movements in either direction.

#### Disadvantages
- High cost of purchasing both [options](../o/options.md).
- Potentially significant [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) if the [asset](../a/asset.md) price remains stable.

### Strangle

A [strangle](../s/strangle.md) is similar to a [straddle](../s/straddle.md), but the call and [put options](../p/put_options.md) have different strike prices. The [call option](../c/call_option.md) typically has a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) than the [put option](../p/put.md). This strategy is used to [profit](../p/profit.md) from significant price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
2. Buy a [put option](../p/put.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

#### Advantages
- Lower cost compared to a [straddle](../s/straddle.md).
- Profits from significant price movements in either direction.

#### Disadvantages
- Wider [range](../r/range.md) required for profitability.
- Potentially significant [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) if the [asset](../a/asset.md) price remains stable.

## Futures Strategies

[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are standardized agreements to buy or sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price and date in the future. They are commonly used for hedging and speculative purposes.

### Long Futures

Long [futures](../f/futures.md) involve buying a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from an anticipated rise in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md).

#### Advantages
- Provides [leverage](../l/leverage.md).
- Potential for significant profits if the price rises.

#### Disadvantages
- High [risk](../r/risk.md) if the price falls.

### Short Futures

Short [futures](../f/futures.md) involve selling a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from an anticipated decline in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

#### Mechanics
1. Sell a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md).

#### Advantages
- Provides [leverage](../l/leverage.md).
- Potential for significant profits if the price falls.

#### Disadvantages
- High [risk](../r/risk.md) if the price rises.

### Calendar Spread

A calendar spread involves taking positions in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) with different expiration dates on the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This strategy aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from changes in the price difference between the two contracts.

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) with a longer [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
2. Sell a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) with a shorter [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).

#### Advantages
- Benefits from [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).
- Lower [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to outright long or short positions.

#### Disadvantages
- Limited [profit](../p/profit.md) potential.
- Complexity in [execution](../e/execution.md).

## Swaps Strategies

Swaps are financial agreements in which two parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) cash flows or other financial instruments. They are used for managing [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), and [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).

### Interest Rate Swap

An [interest rate swap](../i/interest_rate_swap.md) involves exchanging fixed-rate [interest](../i/interest.md) payments for floating-rate [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, or vice versa. This strategy is used to manage [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) exposure.

#### Mechanics
1. Agree on terms with a [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md).
2. [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments based on the agreed terms.

#### Disadvantages
- [Counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
- Potential complexity in [valuation](../v/valuation.md) and management.

### Currency Swap

A [currency swap](../c/currency_swap.md) involves exchanging [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in different currencies. This strategy is used to manage [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) in international operations.

#### Mechanics
1. Agree on terms with a [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md).
2. [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in different currencies.

#### Advantages

- Potential complexity in [execution](../e/execution.md) and management.

### Credit Default Swap (CDS)

A [credit](../c/credit.md) [default](../d/default.md) [swap](../s/swap.md) is a contract that provides protection against the [default](../d/default.md) of a particular [debt instrument](../d/debt_instrument.md). This strategy is used for managing [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a CDS contract to protect against [default risk](../d/default_risk.md).
2. Pay periodic premiums to the seller of the CDS.

#### Advantages
- Provides [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) protection.
- Can be used for speculative purposes.

#### Disadvantages
- [Counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
- Potentially high costs.
