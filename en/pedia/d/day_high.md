# Day High

The day high is the highest price reached by a security during a trading session. It is often used to gauge intraday strength and to set breakout levels.

## Significance
- A new day high can indicate strong buying pressure
- The level can act as intraday resistance or a breakout trigger
- Many short term strategies monitor day highs for momentum signals

## Trading Applications
- Breakout entry: buy when price exceeds the day high with confirmation
- Trailing stop: use a fraction below day high for long positions
- Market profile: day high defines the upper boundary of the session range

## Relationship to Volatility
The distance between day high and day low is a simple measure of intraday volatility. A narrow range suggests consolidation, while a wide range indicates active trading or news influence.

## Interaction with Opening Range
If the day high is set early, the market may spend the rest of the session in consolidation. Traders watch for late session tests of the high to evaluate whether buyers can extend the move.

## Context and Confirmation
Day high breakouts are more reliable when they align with a higher timeframe trend or a broader market move. Volume expansion and a close near the high add confidence.

## Risk Management
Stops are often placed below the breakout level or below the most recent swing. Because intraday highs can be sharp, position sizing should account for potential reversals.

## Limitations
Day highs can be driven by single prints or thin liquidity. Confirmation from volume or multiple touches can improve reliability.

## Practical Notes
Day high should be measured within the exact session definition used for the strategy. Premarket or after hours trading can distort the level if included.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
