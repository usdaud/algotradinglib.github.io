# Depression

An economic depression is a severe and prolonged downturn in economic activity. It is characterized by a significant decline in economic output, employment, trade, and economic growth that lasts for an extended period, typically several years. Depressions are more severe than recessions in terms of both depth and duration, representing the most extreme form of economic contraction in the business cycle.

## Defining Characteristics

### Duration and Severity

A depression is generally defined by:

1. **GDP Decline**: A sustained decline in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of more than 10%, or a recession lasting more than two to three years.
2. **High [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)**: [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates often exceed 20% during depressions.
3. **Deflation**: Prices for goods and services typically fall, leading to a deflationary spiral.
4. **[Business](../b/business.md) Failures**: Widespread [business](../b/business.md) bankruptcies and closures.
5. **[Financial System](../f/financial_system.md) Collapse**: Banking crises and [credit](../c/credit.md) [market](../m/market.md) freezes are common.

### Distinction from Recession

While both depressions and recessions involve economic contractions, depressions are:
- Longer in [duration](../d/duration.md) (years vs. months)
- More severe in impact (GDP decline >10% vs. <10%)
- More widespread in their effects across sectors
- More difficult to recover from

## Historical Examples

### The Great Depression (1929-1939)

The most famous example of an economic depression occurred in the 1930s:

- **Trigger**: The stock [market](../m/market.md) crash of October 1929 (Black Tuesday)
- **GDP Decline**: U.S. GDP fell by approximately 30% between 1929 and 1933
- **[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)**: Peaked at approximately 25% in the United States
- **Global Impact**: Affected virtually all industrialized nations
- **[Duration](../d/duration.md)**: Lasted approximately a decade, with recovery accelerated by World War II
- **Banking Crisis**: Thousands of banks failed, wiping out savings

### Other Notable Depressions

1. **The Long Depression (1873-1896)**: A period of economic stagnation and deflation in Europe and North America.
2. **The Depression of 1920-21**: A short but severe depression following World War I.
3. **Various National Depressions**: Argentina (1998-2002), Russia (1990s), and others have experienced localized depressions.

## Causes of Economic Depressions

### Financial Market Collapse

- [Asset](../a/asset.md) price [bubbles](../b/bubble.md) bursting ([stocks](../s/stock.md), [real estate](../r/real_estate.md))
- Banking system failures
- [Credit](../c/credit.md) [market](../m/market.md) freezes
- Loss of confidence in financial institutions

### Monetary Factors

- Excessive monetary contraction
- Deflation spirals
- [Gold standard](../g/gold_standard.md) constraints (historically)
- Central [bank](../b/bank.md) policy errors

### Structural Factors

- Overproduction and underconsumption
- [Income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md)
- [Trade](../t/trade.md) imbalances
- Technological disruptions

### External Shocks

- Wars and conflicts
- Natural disasters
- Pandemics
- [Commodity](../c/commodity.md) price shocks

## Conclusion

Economic depressions represent the most severe form of economic crisis, with devastating impacts on employment, output, and social welfare. The Great Depression of the 1930s fundamentally changed economic policy, leading to the development of modern macroeconomic theory, central banking practices, and financial regulation. While significant safeguards now exist to prevent and mitigate depressions, understanding their causes, characteristics, and policy responses remains crucial for economists, policymakers, and financial [market](../m/market.md) participants.

The lessons learned from historical depressions continue to inform policy responses to economic crises, as demonstrated by the aggressive interventions during the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic recession. Vigilance, appropriate policy frameworks, and the willingness to act decisively remain essential to preventing future depressions and ensuring economic stability.
