# DAX Stock Index

The DAX (Deutscher Aktienindex) is Germany's leading stock [market index](../m/market_index.md), representing 40 of the largest and most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) blue-chip companies traded on the Frankfurt Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md). It is seen as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for the German [economy](../e/economy.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment in the country. The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) was created in 1988 by the Frankfurt Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) and mirrors the movements of the broader German [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

## Components and Selection Criteria

### Eligibility Criteria

To be included in the DAX, companies must:

1. Have their [shares](../s/shares.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) in the Prime Standard segment, which requires adherence to international [transparency](../t/transparency.md) standards.
2. Be [Xetra](../x/xetra.md)-traded continuously and to have a minimum free [float](../f/float.md) of 10%.
3. Be one of the largest companies in terms of [order book](../o/order_book.md) [volume](../v/volume.md) and [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).
4. Meet certain financial criteria, ensuring the company is among the top-ranking firms in terms of trading [volume](../v/volume.md) and [market value](../m/market_value.md).

### Rebalancing

The composition of the DAX is reviewed quarterly to ensure it accurately represents the German [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). Changes to the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) are typically announced a few weeks in advance. The review dates are usually March, June, September, and December.

## Calculation

The DAX is a performance [index](../i/index_instrument.md), meaning it is calculated by reinvesting all dividends and considering [capital](../c/capital.md) gains. This differentiates it from a price [index](../i/index_instrument.md), where only [capital](../c/capital.md) gains are considered. The DAX's calculation begins at 1,000 points on December 30, 1987, and it is updated every second during trading hours.

### Formula

The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is calculated using the Laspeyres formula, which is a [weighted](../w/weighted.md) [arithmetic mean](../a/arithmetic_mean.md) formula. The formula takes into account the current prices, the base, and the fixed component weights.

$$ \text{[Index](../i/index_instrument.md)} = \left( \frac{\sum (P_t \cdot Q_0)}{\sum (P_0 \cdot Q_0)} \right) \times 1000 $$

Where:
- \( P_t \): Price of the component at time \( t \)
- \( Q_0 \): Initial quantity of [shares](../s/shares.md)
- \( P_0 \): Initial price

## Impact and Importance

The DAX is a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of German economic health and is used by investors worldwide to assess the performance of the German [market](../m/market.md). It is closely monitored by investors, analysts, and policymakers for a variety of reasons:

1. **[Economic Indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md)**: As it comprises Germany's top 30 companies, the DAX serves as a barometer of the country's economic health and [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence.
2. **Investment [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md)**: [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers and investors often use the DAX as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) to measure the performance of their investments in the German [market](../m/market.md).
3. **[Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md)**: Movements in the DAX reflect overall [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). Significant drops or gains could indicate wider economic or financial trends.
