# Demand Draft

A [Demand](../d/demand.md) Draft (DD) is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) used primarily for the transfer of funds from one location to another. Issued by a [bank](../b/bank.md), it serves as a guaranteed way to make payments, commonly used in [business](../b/business.md) transactions, educational fees, and personal remittances. This instrument is widely used in countries like India, where the traditional banking system is still prevalently used.

## Key Features

### Guaranteed Payment
Unlike personal checks, a DD is a secure instrument as it is issued by a [bank](../b/bank.md) and is hence guaranteed. Once a DD is issued, the funds are immediately debited from the account of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), ensuring that the receiver (the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md)) gets the [payment](../p/payment.md) without any [risk](../r/risk.md) of the instrument bouncing due to [insufficient funds](../i/insufficient_funds.md).

### Non-Negotiable
[Demand](../d/demand.md) drafts are generally [non-negotiable](../n/non-negotiable.md). This means that the person to whom the DD is made out can only [deposit](../d/deposit.md) it into their account and cannot endorse it to someone else. This feature ensures that the [payment](../p/payment.md) reaches the intended [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) and adds an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md) to the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

### Requirement for Issuance
To [issue](../i/issue.md) a DD, the applicant needs to fill out a requisition form, provide details of the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md), and pay the amount to be transferred, along with applicable fees. This can be done at a [bank](../b/bank.md) branch, and increasingly, through [online banking](../o/online_banking.md) portals.

### Fixed Amounts
The amount specified in a [demand](../d/demand.md) draft is fixed and cannot be altered. This ensures that the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) receives the exact amount intended by the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) without any discrepancies.

## Types of Demand Drafts

### Sight Demand Draft
A sight [demand](../d/demand.md) draft is payable upon presentation or ‘at sight’. The [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) needs to present the DD at a [bank](../b/bank.md) branch to receive the [payment](../p/payment.md).

### Time Demand Draft
A time [demand](../d/demand.md) draft has a specific date on which it [will](../w/will.md) be payable. The [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) can present the DD on or after the specified date to claim the [payment](../p/payment.md).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
1. **[Security](../s/security.md)**: DDs are safe as they do not involve cash transactions and are less prone to theft or [fraud](../f/fraud.md).
2. **Reliability**: Since the [bank](../b/bank.md) guarantees the [payment](../p/payment.md), it assures the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) of receiving the funds.
3. **Widely Accepted**: DDs are an accepted [mode](../m/mode.md) of [payment](../p/payment.md) for various transactions including educational fees, [business](../b/business.md) payments, and more.
4. **Record Keeping**: Issuing a DD creates a record in the banking system, providing a clear trail of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

### Disadvantages
1. **Fees**: Issuing a [demand](../d/demand.md) draft involves paying a [fee](../f/fee.md) which can be higher compared to other forms of [fund](../f/fund.md) transfers like NEFT or RTGS.
2. **Inconvenience**: Requiring physical presence at a [bank](../b/bank.md) branch for issuance or encashment can be inconvenient.
3. **Time-Consuming**: The process of issuing and [clearing](../c/clearing.md) a DD can be time-consuming compared to electronic [fund](../f/fund.md) transfers.

## Process of Issuing a Demand Draft

### Step-by-Step Issuance

1. **Filling the Form**: The applicant needs to fill out the DD application form providing essential details like the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md)’s name, amount, and reason for the transfer.

2. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) of Amount**: The applicant must pay the amount to be transferred either from their account or in cash, along with the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s [commission](../c/commission.md) for issuing the DD.

3. **[Bank](../b/bank.md) Verification**: The [bank](../b/bank.md) verifies the details and ensures that the account has sufficient funds.

4. **Issuance of DD**: Upon verification, the [bank](../b/bank.md) issues the DD which includes details such as the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s name, branch, date of issuance, and amount.

5. **Handover to Applicant**: The DD is handed over to the applicant who can then send it to the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md).

### Cancellation and Reissuance

1. **Cancellation**: If a DD needs to be canceled, the applicant must submit an application for cancellation along with the original DD. The [bank](../b/bank.md) [will](../w/will.md) then verify the details and upon approval, refund the amount after deducting cancellation charges.

2. **Reissuance**: If a DD is lost or damaged, the applicant can request for a duplicate DD by submitting an application along with an indemnity [bond](../b/bond.md).

## Uses of Demand Drafts

### Business Transactions
Businesses often use DDs for transactions as they are a secure and reliable method of [payment](../p/payment.md). Suppliers and service providers accept DDs as they guarantee [payment](../p/payment.md).

### Educational Institutions
Universities and colleges accept DDs for [payment](../p/payment.md) of tuition fees, examination fees, and other charges. The guaranteed [payment](../p/payment.md) ensures that the institution receives the funds without delay.

### Personal Remittances
Individuals often use DDs to send [money](../m/money.md) across long distances. This is useful especially in areas where electronic transfer facilities are limited.

### Government Payments
Certain government transactions require payments to be made through DDs. For example, application fees for government services or job applications are often paid via DDs.

## Demand Draft vs Other Payment Methods

### Demand Draft vs Cheques
- **[Security](../s/security.md)**: Unlike cheques which can bounce if there are [insufficient funds](../i/insufficient_funds.md), a DD guarantees [payment](../p/payment.md) as the amount is deducted at the time of issuance.
- **Convenience**: Cheques can be conveniently written and given to the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) instantly while a DD requires a visit to the [bank](../b/bank.md).
- **[Endorsement](../e/endorsement.md)**: Cheques can be endorsed to another party whereas DDs are [non-negotiable](../n/non-negotiable.md).

### Demand Draft vs Electronic Transfers
- **Speed**: Electronic transfers like NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS are faster compared to the process of issuing and [clearing](../c/clearing.md) a DD.
- **Cost**: The cost associated with issuing a DD can be higher compared to the fees for electronic transfers.
- **Accessibility**: In areas with limited banking [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), DDs are more accessible as they do not require internet connectivity or electronic devices.
