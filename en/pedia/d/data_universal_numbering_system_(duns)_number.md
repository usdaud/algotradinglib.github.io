# Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number

A DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System) Number is a unique nine-digit identifier for businesses, created by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B). This identifier is used globally to identify and access information on businesses. Companies across the world use DUNS Numbers to identify their [business](../b/business.md) entities uniquely, which facilitates the management of [business](../b/business.md) [credit](../c/credit.md), the improvement of data management, and the enhancement of global [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Origin and Purpose of DUNS Number

The DUNS Number was introduced in 1963 by Dun & Bradstreet, an American company that specializes in providing commercial data, analytics, and insights for businesses. Dun & Bradstreet is a pioneer in the concept of Data Universal Numbering, which helps companies keep track of [business](../b/business.md) entities and their hierarchies.

The primary purpose of a DUNS Number is to act as a unique identifier for a [business](../b/business.md) entity. It helps to:

- Establish a [business](../b/business.md) [credit](../c/credit.md) file.
- Identify a company's corporate family tree.
- Assess [business](../b/business.md) [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md).
- Track financial transactions in compliance with various regulations.

[Business](../b/business.md) entities of all sizes, from small startups to global conglomerates, may obtain a DUNS Number to facilitate better data management and foster [trust](../t/trust.md) in their financial dealings.

## How the DUNS Number Works

A DUNS Number consists of nine digits, which do not carry any apparent meaning or classification and are solely meant for unique identification within the database. This number does not change over time and is not reused; thus, it stays with the [business](../b/business.md) location it is assigned regardless of movement or other changes.

### Steps to Obtain a DUNS Number

Obtaining a DUNS Number is a relatively straightforward process:

1. **Application Submission**: Businesses need to submit an application, typically through the D&B website.
2. **Data Verification**: Dun & Bradstreet verifies the [business](../b/business.md) information provided.
3. **Generation**: A unique nine-digit DUNS Number is generated and issued to the [business](../b/business.md).

The process can be completed in a matter of days, though expedited processing is available for those requiring a number urgently.

## Benefits of a DUNS Number

Having a DUNS Number provides several key benefits for businesses:

### 1. Creditworthiness

One of the most significant advantages of having a DUNS Number is the ability to establish and build a [credit](../c/credit.md) file with Dun & Bradstreet. This file is used by creditors, lenders, and suppliers to evaluate the company's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). A strong D&B [credit](../c/credit.md) file can help businesses secure loans, obtain favorable [payment](../p/payment.md) terms, and reduce costs associated with borrowing.

### 2. Business Identification

DUNS Numbers also serve as a global standard for identifying businesses, making it easier for companies to partake in international [trade](../t/trade.md) and partnerships. It simplifies the identification process for regulatory agencies, potential partners, and suppliers.

### 3. Corporate Family Tree

DUNS Numbers help businesses map out their corporate family structure or hierarchy, providing a clear view of the relationships between parent companies, subsidiaries, and branches. This hierarchical view is useful for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), compliance, and strategic planning.

### 4. Supplier Registration

Many organizations, particularly in government and large enterprises, require suppliers to provide a DUNS Number as part of their registration and vetting process. This process helps ensure that suppliers can be uniquely identified and their [credit](../c/credit.md) histories can be evaluated.

### 5. Industry and Market Analysis
