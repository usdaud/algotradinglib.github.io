# Drawee

A drawee is a financial and legal term referring to the party that is directed to pay a specified sum of [money](../m/money.md) in a [negotiable instrument](../n/negotiable_instrument.md), such as a [check](../c/check.md), [draft](../d/draft.md), or [bill of exchange](../b/bill_of_exchange.md). The drawee is typically a [bank](../b/bank.md) or financial institution that holds the funds of the drawer (the party who writes the [check](../c/check.md) or [draft](../d/draft.md)).

## Key Concepts

### Parties Involved in a Negotiable Instrument

1. **Drawer**: The party who creates and signs the [negotiable instrument](../n/negotiable_instrument.md), ordering the drawee to pay a specified amount.
2. **Drawee**: The party directed to make the [payment](../p/payment.md). In the case of a [check](../c/check.md), this is typically the [bank](../b/bank.md) where the drawer has an account.
3. **[Payee](../p/payee.md)**: The party designated to receive the [payment](../p/payment.md).

### The Role of the Drawee

The drawee's primary responsibility is to honor the [payment](../p/payment.md) request made by the drawer, provided that:
- The drawer has sufficient funds in the account
- The instrument is properly executed and presented
- There are no legal restrictions preventing [payment](../p/payment.md)

When a [check](../c/check.md) is presented to the drawee [bank](../b/bank.md), the [bank](../b/bank.md) verifies the authenticity of the instrument and the availability of funds before processing the [payment](../p/payment.md).

## Types of Instruments Involving Drawees

### Checks

A [check](../c/check.md) is the most common [negotiable instrument](../n/negotiable_instrument.md) involving a drawee. The drawee is the [bank](../b/bank.md) on which the [check](../c/check.md) is drawn. When the [payee](../p/payee.md) deposits or cashes the [check](../c/check.md), their [bank](../b/bank.md) presents it to the drawee [bank](../b/bank.md) for [payment](../p/payment.md).

### Bills of Exchange

In international [trade](../t/trade.md), a [bill of exchange](../b/bill_of_exchange.md) is commonly used. The drawee in this context may be a [bank](../b/bank.md) or the buyer of goods, depending on the terms of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

### Bank Drafts

A [bank draft](../b/bank_draft.md) is a [payment](../p/payment.md) instrument where the [bank](../b/bank.md) itself acts as both the drawer and the guarantor. The drawee is typically another [bank](../b/bank.md) or branch of the same [bank](../b/bank.md).

## Legal Framework

### Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)

In the United States, the rights and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of drawees are governed by Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which covers [negotiable instruments](../n/negotiable_instruments.md).

### Bills of Exchange Act

In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, similar principles are codified in the Bills of [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Act 1882, which defines the relationship between drawers, drawees, and payees.

## Drawee's Liability

The drawee is not automatically liable on a [negotiable instrument](../n/negotiable_instrument.md) until they accept it. Acceptance occurs when the drawee signs the instrument, indicating agreement to pay the specified amount. Once accepted:

- The drawee becomes the **acceptor**
- The acceptor is primarily liable for [payment](../p/payment.md)
- The acceptor must pay the instrument according to its terms at the time of acceptance

## Dishonor by Drawee

If the drawee refuses to pay or accept the instrument, it is said to be **dishonored**. Common reasons for dishonor include:

- Insufficient funds in the drawer's account
- Account closed or frozen
- Signature irregularities
- Stop [payment](../p/payment.md) orders
- Expired or stale-dated instruments

When an instrument is dishonored, the holder may pursue legal remedies against the drawer and any endorsers.

## Practical Applications

### Banking Operations

Banks serving as drawees process millions of checks and drafts daily through automated [clearing](../c/clearing.md) systems such as:
- **ACH ([Automated Clearing House](../a/ach_(automated_clearing_house).md))** in the United States
- **BACS** in the United Kingdom
- **SEPA** in the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md)

### Trade Finance

In international [trade](../t/trade.md), drawees play a crucial role in documentary collections and letters of [credit](../c/credit.md), where banks act as intermediaries to ensure secure [payment](../p/payment.md) between importers and exporters.

## Conclusion

The drawee is a fundamental concept in commercial and banking law, representing the party responsible for making [payment](../p/payment.md) on [negotiable instruments](../n/negotiable_instruments.md). Understanding the role and responsibilities of drawees is essential for anyone involved in banking, [trade finance](../t/trade_finance.md), or commercial transactions.
