# Depreciation

Depreciation is an [accounting method](../a/accounting_method.md) that allocates the cost of a tangible [asset](../a/asset.md) over its [useful life](../u/useful_life.md). Businesses use depreciation to account for declines in the [value](../v/value.md) of their assets over time. This allocation allows companies to generate [revenue](../r/revenue.md) from their assets while expensing a portion of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s cost each year it is in use. Depreciation affects both the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), where assets decline in [value](../v/value.md) over time, and the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), where depreciation expenses are recorded.

## Types of Depreciation Methods

### 1. Straight-Line Depreciation
The straight-line method is the most straightforward and commonly used method. It distributes the cost of the [asset](../a/asset.md) equally across its [useful life](../u/useful_life.md). The formula for calculating straight-line depreciation is:
```
Annual Depreciation [Expense](../e/expense.md) = (Cost of [Asset](../a/asset.md) - [Salvage Value](../s/salvage_value.md)) / [Useful Life](../u/useful_life.md) of [Asset](../a/asset.md)
```
- **Cost of [Asset](../a/asset.md)**: The initial purchase price of the [asset](../a/asset.md).
- **[Salvage Value](../s/salvage_value.md)**: The estimated [value](../v/value.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) at the end of its [useful life](../u/useful_life.md).
- **[Useful Life](../u/useful_life.md)**: The period over which the [asset](../a/asset.md) is expected to be used by the company.

### 2. Declining Balance Depreciation
The [declining balance method](../d/declining_balance_method.md) accelerates depreciation, meaning that the [asset](../a/asset.md) loses [value](../v/value.md) faster in the earlier years of its [useful life](../u/useful_life.md). There are different variations of this method:
#### Double Declining Balance (DDB) Method
This method doubles the depreciation rate of the straight-line method:
```
Annual Depreciation [Expense](../e/expense.md) = 2 x Straight-Line Depreciation Rate x [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) at Beginning of Year
```
#### 150% Declining Balance Method
Similar to DDB but uses 150% of the straight-line depreciation rate:
```
Annual Depreciation [Expense](../e/expense.md) = 1.5 x Straight-Line Depreciation Rate x [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) at Beginning of Year
```

### 3. Units of Production Depreciation
This method bases depreciation on the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s usage, activity, or units of production. It's suitable for assets whose wear and tear is closely related to their use:
```
Depreciation [Expense](../e/expense.md) = (Cost of [Asset](../a/asset.md) - [Salvage Value](../s/salvage_value.md)) / Total Estimated Production x Units Produced in Period
```

### 4. Sum-of-the-Years-Digits (SYD) Depreciation
This method uses a fraction based on the sum of the years' digits to accelerate depreciation:
```
Annual Depreciation [Expense](../e/expense.md) = (Cost of [Asset](../a/asset.md) - [Salvage Value](../s/salvage_value.md)) x (Remaining Years of [Useful Life](../u/useful_life.md) / Sum of the Years Digits)
```
The sum of the years digits is calculated as follows for an [asset](../a/asset.md) with a [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) of n years:
```
Sum of the Years Digits = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1
```

## Importance of Depreciation

### Tax Benefits
One of the primary reasons businesses depreciate assets is for tax purposes. Depreciation is considered a non-cash [expense](../e/expense.md), meaning it reduces [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) without impacting [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md). Companies can defer tax liabilities by expensing depreciation, thereby optimizing their tax strategy over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) years.

### Financial Reporting
Depreciation helps in presenting a realistic financial picture. By spreading the cost of an [asset](../a/asset.md) over its [useful life](../u/useful_life.md), companies can match revenues with related expenses more accurately, following the matching principle in [accounting](../a/accounting.md). This improves the reliability of [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

### Asset Management
Depreciation provides insights into an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) and helps businesses plan for future [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures. This can influence decisions on whether to repair or replace assets, aligning operational capabilities with [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

### Investment Analysis
For investors, knowing how a company depreciates its assets and the resulting depreciation expenses provides valuable information on the company’s cost structures, profitability, and [capital](../c/capital.md) management. This, in turn, can impact investment decisions.

## Factors Affecting Depreciation

### Useful Life
The estimated [duration](../d/duration.md) over which the [asset](../a/asset.md) is expected to be used. This can be influenced by factors like wear and tear, technological advancements, and company policies.

### Salvage Value
The estimated [residual value](../r/residual_value.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) at the end of its [useful life](../u/useful_life.md). [Salvage value](../s/salvage_value.md) can be impacted by [market](../m/market.md) conditions and the expected condition of the [asset](../a/asset.md) at the end of its life.

### Depreciation Method
The method chosen to depreciate the [asset](../a/asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) affect the depreciation [expense](../e/expense.md) recorded each year. Different methods can be used based on the type of [asset](../a/asset.md) and its usage patterns.

### Changes in Estimates
Sometimes, companies may need to revise the [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) or [salvage value](../s/salvage_value.md) estimates. Such changes can impact future depreciation expenses and require adjustments to previous [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

## Depreciation in Different Assets

### Real Estate
Depreciation for [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) is often complex due to the long [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) and significant [salvage value](../s/salvage_value.md). [Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) may also appreciate in [value](../v/value.md), yet depreciation is still applied for tax purposes.

### Machinery and Equipment
These assets typically have a shorter [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) and may use methods like units of production or declining balance depreciation to more accurately reflect usage patterns.

### Vehicles
Depreciation for vehicles can be substantial due to rapid decline in [value](../v/value.md) and heavy usage. Methods like straight-line or declining balance are commonly used.

### Technological Equipment
Items like computers and software often become obsolete quickly, necessitating [accelerated depreciation](../a/accelerated_depreciation.md) methods to reflect rapid decreases in [value](../v/value.md).

## Depreciation and Market Valuation

### Book Value vs. Market Value
Depreciation affects the [book value](../b/book_value.md) of assets, but [market value](../m/market_value.md) can diverge significantly. Investors should consider both values when evaluating a company's [asset](../a/asset.md) base.

### Impact on Earnings
Depreciation reduces [earnings](../e/earnings.md) on the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). Analysts often look at EBITDA ([Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Before [Interest](../i/interest.md), [Taxes](../t/taxes.md), Depreciation, and Amortization) to assess a company's operational performance without the non-cash impact of depreciation.

## Depreciation Policies and Compliance

### Financial Reporting Standards
Depreciation must comply with [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards like Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) in the U.S. or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

### Tax Regulations
Each country has its own tax regulations that dictate allowable depreciation methods and rates. Companies must ensure compliance to benefit from tax deductions without facing legal repercussions.

### Auditor Scrutiny
External auditors review a company's depreciation policies and calculations to ensure accuracy and compliance with [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards.

## Real-World Examples of Depreciation

### Amazon
Amazon extensively uses depreciation as part of its [capital expenditure](../c/capital_expenditure.md) management. Their significant investments in [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) like warehouses, data centers, and [logistics](../l/logistics.md) involve substantial depreciation expenses.
