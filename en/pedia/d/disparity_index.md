# Disparity Index

The Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) is a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool that helps traders measure the current price's deviation from a selected moving average, indicating whether an [asset](../a/asset.md) is [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md). It can be applied to any [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, Forex, etc. This [index](../i/index.md) is beneficial for everyone from day traders to long-term investors in making informed decisions.

## Definition

The Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) is the difference between the current price (or the closing price) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) and its moving average, expressed as a percentage. This percentage can either be positive or negative, indicating how far the current price is from the moving average and in which direction.

### Formula

The formula for calculating the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) is:

\[ 
Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) (\%) = \left( \frac{Current Price - Moving Average}{Moving Average} \right) \times 100 
\]

Where:
- **Current Price** can be either the closing price or the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md).
- **Moving Average** could be a Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), or any other type of moving average.

### Interpretation

- **Positive Disparity [Index](../i/index.md)**: If the [index](../i/index.md) is positive, the current price is above the moving average, suggesting a potential [overbought](../o/overbought.md) condition.
- **Negative Disparity [Index](../i/index.md)**: If the [index](../i/index.md) is negative, the current price is below the moving average, indicating a potential [oversold](../o/oversold.md) condition.

### Typical Use Cases

1. **Identifying [Overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [Oversold](../o/oversold.md) Conditions**: Traders often use the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) to ascertain whether the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) is trading at an extremely high or low level relative to its moving average.
2. **Entry and Exit Signals**: A high positive Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) might signal a good selling opportunity, while a high negative Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) could indicate a buying opportunity.
3. **Divergences**: Traders can also use the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) to identify divergences between price and its moving average, helping to anticipate [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals.

### Example

Imagine the current price of a stock is $150, and its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $140. The Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) would be calculated as follows:

\[ 
Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) (\%) = \left( \frac{150 - 140}{140} \right) \times 100 = 7.14\%
\]

In this case, a Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) of 7.14% indicates that the current price is 7.14% above its [50-day moving average](../1/50-day_moving_average.md).

## Integrating the Disparity Index into Trading Strategies

Integrating the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) into [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) involves combining it with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) frameworks, and algorithmic strategies.

### Combined Indicators

1. **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI)**: When combined with RSI, the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) can provide more profound insights into [overbought](../o/overbought.md)/[oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.
2. **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: Utilizing [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) along with the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) can help in understanding price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) tendencies.
3. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md))**: Using the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) in conjunction with MACD can enhance the accuracy in spotting [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals.

### Algorithmic Trading

In the world of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) can be systematically incorporated into [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md):

1. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) Algorithms**: If the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) indicates that the price is significantly deviated from the moving average, a [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategy could be implemented to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the [market](../m/market.md) returning to its average levels.
2. **[Momentum Trading](../m/momentum_trading.md) Algorithms**: Algorithms can also use the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md) to gauge [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md). A high positive [value](../v/value.md) might be used to ride an upward [trend](../t/trend.md), and vice versa.
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) Algorithms**: By setting predefined thresholds for the Disparity [Index](../i/index.md), traders can automate the process for stop-loss and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) orders.
