# Day Order

In the realm of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), a day [order](../o/order.md) is an instruction given by an [investor](../i/investor.md) to their [broker](../b/broker.md) to either buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) at a specified price. This [order](../o/order.md) remains active only for the trading day on which it is placed, automatically expiring if not executed by the end of the [trading session](../t/trading_session.md). The concept and utilization of a day [order](../o/order.md) are foundational to [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), especially those involving short-term trades.

## Definition of a Day Order

A day [order](../o/order.md) is a type of [order](../o/order.md) instructing brokers to execute a [trade](../t/trade.md) at a certain price, but only valid during that trading day. If the [order](../o/order.md) is not filled by the [market](../m/market.md) close, it is automatically canceled. Unlike other types of orders, such as Good 'Till Canceled (GTC) orders, which can remain active for [multiple](../m/multiple.md) days or until explicitly canceled, day orders provide a temporal constraint that ensures trades are concluded within a single [trading session](../t/trading_session.md).

## Duration of a Day Order

The [duration](../d/duration.md) of a day [order](../o/order.md) is confined to the daily [trading session](../t/trading_session.md) of the [market](../m/market.md) in which the [order](../o/order.md) is placed. For instance, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) places a day [order](../o/order.md) at 10 AM to buy [shares](../s/shares.md) of a particular company at a specific price, and the price is not achievable for the rest of the trading day, the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) be canceled at the [market](../m/market.md)'s close. This is crucial for traders who seek to engage in [intraday trading](../i/intraday_trading.md), as it ensures that their strategies are enacted within the timeframe of a single day's price movements.

## Types of Day Orders

There are several types of day orders that cater to different [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and objectives. Some common types include:

### Market Orders

[Market](../m/market.md) orders are day orders that instruct the [broker](../b/broker.md) to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) at the best available current price. These orders are usually executed immediately because they do not specify a price limit. However, the [execution](../e/execution.md) price may vary depending on [market](../m/market.md) conditions at the time the [order](../o/order.md) is placed.

### Limit Orders

Limit orders specify a price limit at which the day [order](../o/order.md) should be executed. For a [buy limit order](../b/buy_limit_order.md), this price is the maximum price the [investor](../i/investor.md) is willing to pay, while for a sell [limit order](../l/limit_order.md), it is the minimum price the [investor](../i/investor.md) is willing to accept. If the [market price](../m/market_price.md) does not reach the specified limit within the trading day, the [order](../o/order.md) is not executed.

### Stop Orders

Stop orders become [market](../m/market.md) orders once a certain [price level](../p/price_level.md), known as the stop price, is reached. A [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) to buy becomes a [market order](../m/market_order.md) when the [market price](../m/market_price.md) reaches or exceeds the stop price, while a [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) to sell becomes a [market order](../m/market_order.md) when the [market price](../m/market_price.md) drops to or below the stop price.

### Stop-Limit Orders

[Stop-limit orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md) combine elements of both stop orders and limit orders. When the stop price is reached, the [stop-limit order](../s/stop-limit_order.md) converts to a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md). Unlike a [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) that executes at the [market price](../m/market_price.md) once triggered, the limit price places constraints on the [execution](../e/execution.md), ensuring the [order](../o/order.md) cannot be filled at a price less favorable than the limit price.

## Example of a Day Order

Consider an [investor](../i/investor.md) who wishes to purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) of Company XYZ, which is currently trading at $100 per share. The [investor](../i/investor.md) believes that the share price might drop to $95 within the trading day. They place a day [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) to buy 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of Company XYZ at a price of $95.

During the [trading session](../t/trading_session.md), if the share price of Company XYZ drops to $95 or lower, the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) be executed and the [investor](../i/investor.md) [will](../w/will.md) purchase the 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) at $95 or a better price. However, if the price does not fall to $95 by the end of the [trading session](../t/trading_session.md), the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) automatically expire.

An example of a financial services company where one can place such orders is **Fidelity**. They [offer](../o/offer.md) comprehensive [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) tailored to both retail and institutional investors: Fidelity.

In the world of high-frequency trading and algorithmic strategies, the use of day orders is prevalent due to their compatibility with precision-based, time-sensitive trading tactics. By utilizing day orders, traders can enforce temporal constraints on their trades, ensuring that positions are opened and closed within the confines of a single [trading session](../t/trading_session.md), thereby mitigating overnight risks.

In summary, the day [order](../o/order.md) is a fundamental tool used by traders and investors to execute trades within the [duration](../d/duration.md) of a single trading day, leveraging [market price](../m/market_price.md) movements to fulfill specific [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). From [market](../m/market.md) orders to limit and stop orders, the various types of day orders provide versatility and control, making them indispensable in the [execution](../e/execution.md) of disciplined and effective trading plans.
