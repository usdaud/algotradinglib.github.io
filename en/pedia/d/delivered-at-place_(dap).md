# Delivered-at-Place (DAP)

Delivered-at-Place (DAP) is an international [trade](../t/trade.md) term, one of the [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) rules, published by the International Chamber of [Commerce](../c/commerce.md) (ICC). [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) are a series of predefined commercial terms that specify responsibilities of buyers and sellers in the delivery of goods under sales contracts. Introduced in the latest iteration of the [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) in 2010, DAP is a frequently used term in global [trade](../t/trade.md). It specifies that the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the agreed place of destination and for covering all costs and risks associated with transporting the goods to that location, excluding [import](../i/import.md) duties and [taxes](../t/taxes.md). This detailed article offers an in-depth exploration of key elements related to DAP.

## Seller's Obligations Under DAP

Under DAP, the seller is responsible for the following tasks:
1. **[Provision](../p/provision.md) of Goods**: The seller must provide the goods in conformity with the contract of [sale](../s/sale.md) and support documents.
2. **Packaging and Marking**: Goods must be appropriately packaged and marked.
3. **[Export](../e/export.md) Formalities**: The seller must take care of all [export](../e/export.md) formalities, such as [export](../e/export.md) licensing and [export](../e/export.md) [clearing](../c/clearing.md).
4. **Carriage and Delivery**: The seller is responsible for arranging and paying for carriage to deliver the goods to the named place of destination. This includes the main carriage, unloading at the destination port or terminal, and all subsequent transport legs.
5. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) and Safety**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) for the goods remains with the seller until the goods are delivered to the named destination.
6. **Providing Proof**: The seller must provide proof of delivery and other necessary documents to the buyer.
7. **Cost Allocation**: The seller bears all costs related to [export](../e/export.md) clearance, terminal charges, and transportation and for delivering the goods to the specified location.

## Buyer's Obligations Under DAP

The buyer's responsibilities under DAP include:
1. **[Import](../i/import.md) Formalities**: Handling [import](../i/import.md) customs clearance and paying [import](../i/import.md) duties and [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
2. **Taking Delivery**: The buyer is responsible for taking delivery of the goods at the named place of destination.
3. **Cost Responsibility**: The buyer bears costs and risks from the time the goods have been delivered to the named destination.
4. **Providing Information**: Providing any relevant information for [import](../i/import.md) formalities and paying any related costs in their country.

## Key Considerations when Using DAP

1. **Named Place of Destination**: Precision is critical in naming the place of destination; details must be specified in the contract to avoid disputes.
2. **Responsibility Shift**: The buyer assumes responsibility for unloading the goods at the destination unless explicitly specified otherwise.
3. **Communication**: Effective communication between buyer and seller is pivotal to ensure smooth transactions, especially concerning delivery timelines and handling.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Seller Control**: Sellers have control over transport and [logistics](../l/logistics.md) to the named destination, which can lead to better service reliability.
- **Predictable Costs**: It allows sellers to predict and manage end-to-end transportation costs more effectively.
- **Reduced [Risk](../r/risk.md) for Buyer**: Buyers face minimized risks as sellers [handle](../h/handle.md) transportation.

### Disadvantages

- **Complexity for Sellers**: Sellers have to manage international shipping [logistics](../l/logistics.md), which can be complex and demanding.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) of Delay**: Any delays at the destination may cause additional charges or inconveniences for the seller.

## Practical Application of DAP

### Example Scenario

Imagine a textile manufacturer in India selling fabric to a clothing brand in Germany. The contract terms are DAP Berlin. Here’s how the responsibilities are divided:

- The Indian manufacturer [will](../w/will.md) arrange for the goods to be transported, covering all costs and risks up to Berlin.
- The manufacturer also manages [export](../e/export.md) clearance in India.
- Upon arrival, the German buyer handles [import](../i/import.md) customs and pays any associated [import duty](../i/import_duty.md) and VAT.
- Risks transfer from the manufacturer to the buyer once the fabric is delivered and made available for unloading at the specified Berlin address.

### Real-World Use

Several global companies utilize DAP for their international [procurement](../p/procurement.md) operations. A notable example is Siemens, a global industrial [conglomerate](../c/conglomerate.md), which often uses DAP terms for importing equipment and components from international suppliers to their various operational sites across the world.

For instance, when Siemens sources components from Asia for their factories in Europe, they frequently employ DAP terms. The Asian suppliers manage the shipping and deliver the components directly to Siemens' plants in Europe, mitigating considerable logistical burdens for Siemens.

## Comparison with Other Incoterms

### DAP vs. DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)

While both DAP and DDP involve the seller delivering goods to a named destination, the fundamental difference lies in the responsibility for [import](../i/import.md) customs and duties. In DAP, the buyer handles these, while in DDP, the seller assumes responsibility for [import](../i/import.md) duties and clearance.

### DAP vs. FOB (Free on Board)

FOB terms indicate the seller’s responsibility ends once the goods are loaded onto the shipping vessel. From this point, the buyer takes responsibility for the transportation costs and risks. In contrast, DAP extends the seller’s responsibility until the goods arrive at the named destination.

## Conclusion

Delivered-at-Place (DAP) offers a well-defined obligation split between buyers and sellers, with the seller assuming costs and risks up to the point of delivery at the named place. It ensures clarity and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in international [trade](../t/trade.md), helping organizations streamline [logistics](../l/logistics.md) and minimize risks. However, it necessitates precise agreement on the delivery location and clear communication of responsibilities, especially related to customs and [import](../i/import.md) duties. Understanding DAP thoroughly can significantly benefit businesses engaged in global [trade](../t/trade.md) by aligning expectations and reducing logistical uncertainties.
