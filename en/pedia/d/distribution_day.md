# Distribution Day

A distribution day is a trading session where a major index closes lower on higher volume than the previous day. It is used to identify institutional selling pressure.

## Interpretation
Multiple distribution days in a short period can signal weakening market trends and potential reversals. It is often used in conjunction with trend analysis.

## Use in Trading
Traders monitor the count of recent distribution days to gauge market health. A rising count can prompt tighter risk controls or reduced long exposure.

## Data Considerations
Volume comparisons can be distorted by events such as rebalancing or index changes. Adjusting for known events can improve signal quality.

## Limitations
Not every distribution day leads to a market decline. It is best used as a warning signal rather than a precise timing tool.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
