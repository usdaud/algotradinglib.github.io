# Demand Schedules

A [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule is a table or a chart that shows the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a specified period. It plays a crucial role in the fields of [economics](../e/economics.md) and financial trading, including [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (often abbreviated as 'algo trading' or 'algotrading'). In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), understanding [demand](../d/demand.md) schedules can optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and contribute to more effective decision-making.

## Definition and Structure of Demand Schedules

In [economics](../e/economics.md), the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule is a fundamental tool that reflects the relationship between the [price level](../p/price_level.md) and the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) of a given product. This relationship can be expressed in a tabular form (as a table) or graphically (as a [demand curve](../d/demand_curve.md)). The primary components of a [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule include:

1. **Price Levels**: The various prices at which goods or services can be sold.
2. **[Quantity Demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md)**: The specific quantities of the goods or services that consumers are willing to buy at those price levels.

A typical [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule might look something like this:

| Price (P) | [Quantity Demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) (Q) |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| $10       | 100 units             |
| $8        | 150 units             |
| $6        | 200 units             |
| $4        | 300 units             |
| $2        | 500 units             |

This table indicates that as the price decreases, the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) generally increases, all else being equal.

## Types of Demand Schedules

### Individual Demand Schedule

An individual [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule represents the different quantities of a good that a single consumer is willing and able to purchase at various price levels.

### Market Demand Schedule

A [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule aggregates the individual [demand](../d/demand.md) schedules of all consumers in a [market](../m/market.md), showing the total [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) at each [price level](../p/price_level.md) by all consumers.

## Law of Demand

The [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule is based on the [Law of Demand](../l/law_of_demand.md), which states that, all else being equal, there is an inverse relationship between the price of a good and the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md). In other words, as the price of a good increases, the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) decreases and vice versa.

### Exceptions to the Law of Demand

While the [Law of Demand](../l/law_of_demand.md) holds true for most goods, there are exceptions:

1. **Veblen Goods**: Products that become more desirable as their price increases, often because they confer some status on the owner.
2. **Giffen Goods**: Goods for which an increase in price leads to an increase in [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md), due to the strong [income effect](../i/income_effect.md) overpowering the [substitution effect](../s/substitution_effect.md).

## Importance in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) utilizes computer algorithms to execute trades at speeds and frequencies impossible for a human [trader](../t/trader.md). We can apply the principles of [demand](../d/demand.md) schedules to develop, test, and optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). 

### Developing Trading Algorithms

By understanding the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule of a stock or [security](../s/security.md), algo traders can program algorithms to predict price movements based on historical [demand](../d/demand.md) data. For instance, if a [security](../s/security.md)'s [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule indicates that the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) significantly increases when the price drops to a certain level, an algorithm could be programmed to execute purchases at or below this level to take advantage of future price rises as [demand](../d/demand.md) increases the price.

### Forecasting and Backtesting

Using historical [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule data, algorithms can be backtested to determine how they would have performed under historical conditions. This helps in refining the strategies before they are deployed in real [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Real-time Data Analysis

Algo traders can use [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md) to continuously update [demand](../d/demand.md) schedules and make split-second trading decisions. For example, if a new piece of information affects the [demand](../d/demand.md) for a stock, the algorithm can quickly adjust the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule and react faster than a human could.

## Factors Affecting Demand Schedules

Several factors can cause shifts in the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule:

### Income Changes

An increase in consumers' incomes generally increases the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) at each [price level](../p/price_level.md), shifting the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule to the right. Conversely, a decrease in [income](../i/income.md) shifts the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule to the left.

### Preferences and Tastes

Changes in consumer preferences can shift the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule. For example, a new fashion [trend](../t/trend.md) can increase the [demand](../d/demand.md) for certain clothing items, shifting the schedule to the right.

### Prices of Related Goods

- **Substitutes**: An increase in the price of a [substitute](../s/substitute.md) good can increase the [demand](../d/demand.md) for the original good, shifting the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule to the right.
- **Complements**: An increase in the price of a complementary good can decrease the [demand](../d/demand.md) for the original good, shifting the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule to the left.

### Expectations of Future Prices

If consumers expect prices to rise in the future, they may increase their current [demand](../d/demand.md), shifting the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule to the right. If they expect prices to fall, they may decrease their current [demand](../d/demand.md), shifting the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule to the left.

### Market Size

An increase in the number of buyers in the [market](../m/market.md) [will](../w/will.md) shift the [demand](../d/demand.md) schedule to the right, while a decrease in the number of buyers [will](../w/will.md) shift it to the left.

## Practical Application in Trading Platforms

Several trading platforms and financial services companies employ [demand](../d/demand.md) schedules as part of their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Below are a couple of examples:
