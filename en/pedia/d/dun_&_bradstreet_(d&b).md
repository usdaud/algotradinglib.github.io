## Historical Background

Dun & Bradstreet's history dates back to 1841 when Lewis Tappan, a savvy businessman, founded the "Mercantile Agency" in New York City.

This service addressed a critical need in the expanding American [economy](../e/economy.md), where businesses required trustworthy information to make [credit](../c/credit.md) decisions.

Over the years, the Mercantile Agency evolved and merged with other players, eventually becoming known as Dun & Bradstreet in 1933 after merging with R.G. Dun & Company. The company has since grown into a global leader in [business](../b/business.md) information and analytics.
