# Delta One

Delta one instruments have price movements that track the underlying asset one for one. They behave like direct exposure with minimal convexity.

## Examples
- Cash equities
- Futures contracts on equity indices
- Total return swaps in some structures

## Trading Implications
Delta one products are used for efficient exposure, hedging, and tactical allocations. They are simpler to model than options because their payoff is linear.

## Risk and Leverage
Many delta one instruments require margin rather than full cash payment, which creates embedded leverage. Leverage increases both potential return and potential loss.

## Funding and Carry
The cost of holding delta one exposure depends on financing rates, dividends, and roll costs for futures. These costs can materially affect long term returns.

## Liquidity Considerations
High liquidity in delta one products can make them suitable for rapid execution. However, during stress events liquidity can thin out and cause slippage.

## Practical Notes
Delta one exposure is not risk free. Risk controls should treat these positions as fully exposed to underlying price moves.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
