# Depository

A depository is a financial institution or organization that provides services related to the safekeeping, handling, and recording of financial securities, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other financial assets. The primary function of a depository is to facilitate the settlement of securities transactions and to ensure that ownership records are accurately maintained, thereby reducing the risks and complexities associated with the physical handling of certificates. Depositories play a critical role in the functioning of stock markets and other financial systems by providing a secure and efficient [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) for the trading and management of securities.

## Functions and Services

Depositories [offer](../o/offer.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of services that are essential for the smooth operation of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These functions can be broadly categorized into three main areas: safekeeping, settlement, and corporate actions.

### Safekeeping

1. **Electronic Custody:** Depositories maintain securities in electronic form, eliminating the need for physical certificates. This reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss, theft, or damage to physical securities.
2. **Record-Keeping:** They maintain detailed records of securities ownership, including any changes that occur due to transfers, trades, or other activities.

### Settlement

1. **Settlement of Trades:** Depositories facilitate the efficient and timely settlement of securities transactions. This involves the transfer of securities from the seller's account to the buyer's account, along with the corresponding transfer of funds.
2. **Delivery vs. [Payment](../p/payment.md) (DvP):** They ensure that the transfer of securities occurs only when [payment](../p/payment.md) is made, reducing [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).

### Corporate Actions

1. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Processing:** Depositories manage the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of dividends and other [income](../i/income.md) to the rightful owners of securities.
