# Delivery Notice

A delivery notice is a formal notification in futures markets that a short position intends to make delivery of the underlying asset. It initiates the delivery process in physically settled contracts.

## Process
- The short submits a notice to the clearinghouse
- The clearinghouse assigns a long position to receive delivery
- Terms are based on exchange rules and contract specifications

## Timing
Delivery notices typically start after first notice day and can continue until the contract expires. The timing affects liquidity and pricing behavior.

## Trading Impact
After delivery notices begin, liquidity in the contract can decline. Many traders exit or roll positions before this period to avoid delivery risk.

## Operational Risks
Failure to manage delivery notices can lead to operational complications and unexpected obligations. Traders should track first notice day and last trading day closely.

## Practical Notes
Some contracts allow for cash settlement instead of physical delivery. Always verify settlement terms to avoid surprises.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
