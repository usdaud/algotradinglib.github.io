# Distribution

The term "distribution" in the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) refers to various concepts, from [probability distributions](../p/probability_distributions_in_trading.md) of returns to the [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) of trades. Below, we explore these concepts in depth.

## 1. Probability Distribution

### Overview

[Probability distributions](../p/probability_distributions_in_trading.md) are a fundamental aspect of statistical analysis in [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). They describe the [range](../r/range.md) of possible outcomes and the probability of each outcome occurring. This probabilistic framework enables quants (quantitative analysts) and traders to model and predict the behavior of financial assets.

### Types of Distributions

1. **[Normal Distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md)**: Also known as the [Gaussian distribution](../g/gaussian_distribution.md), it is characterized by its bell-shaped curve. It is symmetric around the mean, indicating that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. It’s commonly used to model stock returns.

2. **[Log-Normal Distribution](../l/log-normal_distribution.md)**: Often used to model stock prices rather than returns because prices cannot be negative and tend to grow exponentially over time.

3. **Student's t-Distribution**: Useful and more realistic for financial returns due to its heavier tails compared to the [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md). It accounts for the higher likelihood of extreme events.

4. **Exponential Distribution**: This is often used to model the time between trades or [market](../m/market.md) events, given its memoryless property.

5. **[Binomial Distribution](../b/binomial_distribution.md)**: Useful for modeling scenarios with two possible outcomes, e.g., up or down movement in price.

### Applications in Trading

- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Understanding the distribution of returns aids in [portfolio risk management](../p/portfolio_risk_management.md), allowing for better estimates of [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR) and Conditional [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (CVaR).
- **Option Pricing**: Models like Black-Scholes depend on the [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) to estimate option prices.
- **[Quantitative Strategies](../q/quantitative_strategies_in_trading.md)**: Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), and various [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models rely on understanding the distribution properties of [asset](../a/asset.md) returns.

## 2. Distribution of Trading Algorithms

### Deployment and Execution

The distribution of algorithmic strategies refers to how these are disseminated and executed across different [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). This involves [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), data dissemination, and latency considerations.

### Key Components

1. **[Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md)**: High-frequency trading (HFT) firms and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds invest heavily in [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) to ensure their algorithms are executed efficiently. This includes colocations with exchanges, fiber optic networks, and microwave towers.

2. **Data Dissemination**: [Market](../m/market.md) data feeds are required to keep [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) well-informed of the latest prices, trades, and [market](../m/market.md) events. The speed and reliability of these feeds can significantly impact trading outcomes.

3. **Latency**: The delay between the signal generation by the algorithm and the [execution](../e/execution.md) of a [trade](../t/trade.md). Reducing latency is crucial in HFT where milliseconds can determine success or failure.

    - **Types of Latency**:
        - Network Latency: The time taken for data to travel from the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) to the trading [firm](../f/firm.md)'s servers.
        - Processing Latency: The time taken to process data and make trading decisions.
        - [Order](../o/order.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md) Latency: The time taken from sending the [order](../o/order.md) to the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) to its actual [execution](../e/execution.md).

### Example Providers

- **Colocation Services**: Companies like Equinix provide colocation services where trading firms can place their servers in close proximity to exchanges ([Equinix](https://www.equinix.com/services/data-centers/)).
  
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Data Feeds**: Thomson [Reuters](../r/reuters.md) and [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) are major providers of [market](../m/market.md) data feeds essential for [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) ([Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com)).

## 3. Clearing and Settlement

### Overview

After [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) needs to be processed – this is where [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) come in.

### Clearing

[Clearing](../c/clearing.md) refers to the process of reconciling orders between two parties. It’s aimed at ensuring that both parties honor their [trade](../t/trade.md) commitments, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).

- **Clearinghouses**: Centralized entities like the [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Trust](../t/trust.md) & [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (DTCC) in the United States [handle](../h/handle.md) this process. They act as an intermediary, guaranteeing the [trade](../t/trade.md).
  
- **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Clearinghouses often require traders to post margins. For [futures](../f/futures.md) and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), this involves daily marking to [market](../m/market.md).

### Settlement

Settlement is the actual transfer of the [asset](../a/asset.md) from the seller to the buyer and the corresponding transfer of funds.

- **T+2/T+1**: Most [equity](../e/equity.md) trades settle two days after the [trade](../t/trade.md) date (T+2). There’s a push to reduce this to one day (T+1) to reduce [risk](../r/risk.md).
  
- **Digital Settlement**: Innovations like [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and digital ledger technologies (DLT) propose to revolutionize how settlement is conducted, aiming for instantaneous settlement.

### Real-World Examples

- **DTCC**: The world's largest financial services [corporation](../c/corporation.md) dealing with the post-[trade](../t/trade.md) settlements ([DTCC](https://www.dtcc.com)).

## 4. Distribution of Portfolio Returns

### Portfolio Theory

The distribution of portfolio returns is central to modern portfolio theory (MPT). MPT uses statistical measures like the mean ([expected return](../e/expected_return.md)) and [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) ([risk](../r/risk.md)) to create an optimized portfolio.

### Risk Parity and Diversification

- **[Risk Parity](../r/risk_parity.md)**: A method in which assets are allocated so that each [asset](../a/asset.md) contributes equally to the portfolio’s overall [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Spreading investments across various assets to reduce the impact of any single [asset](../a/asset.md)’s performance on the overall portfolio.

### Portfolio Simulation

Monte Carlo simulations are often employed to generate a distribution of potential portfolio outcomes. This helps in understanding the [range](../r/range.md) of possible future returns under different [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

- **[Scenario Analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md)**: Testing how a portfolio performs under different hypothetical [market](../m/market.md) scenarios.
- **[Stress Testing](../s/stress_testing.md)**: Assessing how extreme [market](../m/market.md) conditions impact [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md).

## 5. Order Distribution Algorithms

[Order](../o/order.md) distribution algorithms are designed to execute large orders in the [market](../m/market.md) without causing significant [market](../m/market.md) impact. These are crucial for institutional investors and large [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds.

### Types of Order Distribution Algorithms

1. **TWAP (Time-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price)**: Splits orders evenly over a specified time period.
2. **VWAP ([Volume](../v/volume.md) [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price)**: Executes orders in proportion to the historical trading [volume](../v/volume.md) at given times.
3. **POV (Percentage of [Volume](../v/volume.md))**: Executes orders as a percentage of the trading [volume](../v/volume.md) in the [market](../m/market.md).
4. **Implementation [Shortfall](../s/shortfall.md)**: Tries to minimize the difference between the decision price and the final [execution](../e/execution.md) price, adapting to [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
5. **Iceberg Orders**: Only a small part of the [order](../o/order.md) is visible to the [market](../m/market.md) at any time, hiding the total [order](../o/order.md) size.

### Major Providers

- **Algo [Execution](../e/execution.md) Providers**: Firms like Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, and Renaissance Technologies [offer](../o/offer.md) sophisticated [order](../o/order.md) [execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md) ([Citadel Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com), [Virtu Financial](https://www.virtu.com), [Renaissance Technologies](https://www.rentech.com)).

## Conclusion

Distribution in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) encompasses a wide [range](../r/range.md) of concepts, from the statistical properties of [asset](../a/asset.md) returns to the mechanisms of executing and settling trades. Each aspect plays a crucial role in how trades are formulated, executed, and cleared. With rapid advancements in technology and the increasing complexity of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), understanding these distributions is more critical than ever for successful [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
