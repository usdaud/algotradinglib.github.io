# Delivered at Frontier (DAF)

Delivered at Frontier (DAF) is an international [trade](../t/trade.md) term used to define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in the shipping and delivery of goods. Developed by the International Chamber of [Commerce](../c/commerce.md) (ICC) and part of the [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) 2000 rules, DAF is a guideline for managing international [trade](../t/trade.md) [logistics](../l/logistics.md), pointing out the exact point at which the risks, costs, and responsibilities transfer from the seller to the buyer. However, it's key to [note](../n/note.md) that as of the [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) 2010 update, DAF has been replaced by the Delivered at Place (DAP) term.

## Definition and Responsibilities

DAF stipulates that the seller delivers goods to a named frontier – generally before the border of the importing country. It's the point often before customs clearance. Here are the responsibilities delineated under DAF:

1. **Seller Responsibilities:**
 - **Transportation:** The seller is responsible for delivering the goods up to the named frontier.
 - **[Export](../e/export.md) Duties and Documentation:** The seller needs to [handle](../h/handle.md) all [export](../e/export.md) duties and documentation necessary for shipping.
 - **Cost and [Risk](../r/risk.md):** All costs and risks involved in transporting the goods to the frontier are borne by the seller.
 - **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md):** The seller must insure the goods against loss or damage until the delivery point.
 - **Notify Buyer:** The seller is required to notify the buyer when the goods have reached the delivery point.

2. **Buyer Responsibilities:**
 - **[Import](../i/import.md) Duties and Documentation:** The buyer is responsible for managing and paying for all [import](../i/import.md) duties and customs clearance once the goods have reached the named frontier.
 - **Further Transportation:** It's the buyer’s obligation to arrange and pay for any onward transportation beyond the named frontier.
 - **Cost and [Risk](../r/risk.md):** The buyer assumes all risks and costs once the goods have been delivered to the frontier.

## Historical Context

### Pre-2010 Usage

Prior to the [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) 2010 revision, DAF was commonly used in international [trade](../t/trade.md), particularly in scenarios involving land transportation across borders, such as within Europe or between countries sharing a common border in other parts of the world. It was particularly useful in [trade](../t/trade.md) situations where goods might pass through several countries before reaching their final destination, simplifying the customs and [taxation](../t/taxation.md) processes by giving clear [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on who is responsible at which point.

### Shift to DAP

In 2010, the [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) were revised, and DAF was replaced by DAP (Delivered at Place). This change reflects a move towards simplifying [trade](../t/trade.md) terms and better reflecting the realities of contemporary global [trade](../t/trade.md) practices. DAP expanded on the concept of DAF by not limiting the delivery to a frontier and instead specifying a named place of destination which could be more precisely defined.

## Practical Implications

### Use Cases

- **Cross-border [Trade](../t/trade.md):** DAF was particularly practical for trades that took place overland and across borders, such as intra-European [trade](../t/trade.md) where countries share common frontiers. It simplified the responsibilities, such as when transporting goods by road from Germany to Poland.
- **Railway Transport:** DAF was also widely used in railway transport scenarios, where goods needed to cross borders en route to their final destination.
- **Multi-Modal Transport:** Sometimes applicable in multi-modal transport where goods might pass from sea or air to land transport for final delivery.

### Key Benefits

- **Clear Responsibility:** DAF provided clear delineation of responsibilities, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of disputes between sellers and buyers concerning where and when costs and risks transferred.
- **Efficient Customs Clearance:** Especially beneficial in terms of efficient customs clearance in the exporting country, as the seller handled all [export](../e/export.md)-related processes.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Clarity in Responsibility:** Offers a clear framework defining the point of [risk](../r/risk.md) transfer, facilitating smoother transactions.
- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Facilitation:** Simplifies the customs process for the buyer, as the seller takes care of all [export](../e/export.md) documentation and procedures.
- **Cost Management:** Helps both parties manage costs effectively, as they clearly understand which costs they are responsible for.

### Disadvantages

- **[Logistics](../l/logistics.md) Complexity:** Can be complex to manage, especially if the frontier is far from the ultimate destination.
- **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md):** The seller bears significant [insurance](../i/insurance.md) responsibility, which may lead to increased costs.
- **Dependency on Seller:** The buyer relies heavily on the seller for timely delivery up to the frontier, which might affect the overall [logistics](../l/logistics.md) planning.

## Replacement by DAP (Delivered at Place)

In the [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) 2010 update, ICC replaced DAF with DAP (Delivered at Place). DAP is more flexible and broad, allowing delivery to any named place agreed upon by both parties, not necessarily a frontier. This better aligns with the needs of modern global [commerce](../c/commerce.md) where shipment routes and transportation modes have become more varied and complex.

### DAP Responsibilities

- **Seller Responsibilities:**
 - Delivering goods to the named place of destination.
 - Bearing all costs and risks until the goods are delivered.
 - Handling [export](../e/export.md) clearance and documentation but not [import](../i/import.md).

- **Buyer Responsibilities:**
 - Assuming risks and costs upon delivery at the named place.
 - Managing [import](../i/import.md) clearance and any associated costs.

### Transition to DAP

The shift to DAP was designed to provide a more intuitive and practical set of rules for international shipping, applicable to a wider variety of scenarios beyond just land transport. This change aimed to keep the [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) relevant in an era of growing international [trade](../t/trade.md) complexity, [offering](../o/offering.md) a more blanket approach that could be universally applied.

## Conclusion

Delivered at Frontier (DAF) served as an important Incoterm for defining responsibilities in international [trade](../t/trade.md), particularly overland and for cross-border transactions. Although replaced by DAP in [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) 2010, the principles [underlying](../u/underlying.md) DAF continue to influence modern [trade](../t/trade.md) practices by informing the transfer of risks, costs, and responsibilities. Understanding DAF provides invaluable insight into the evolution of international commercial terms and aids in comprehending the foundation upon which current [trade](../t/trade.md) terms like DAP are built.
