# Discretionary Algorithms

**Discretionary Algorithms** refer to a type of [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) where the decision-making process involves significant human oversight or intervention. Unlike fully automated or mechanical [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), which execute predefined rules without human input, discretionary algorithms allow traders to use their [judgment](../j/judgment.md) and discretion at various stages of the trading process. This hybrid approach combines the strengths of both human intuition and computational power, enabling more flexible and adaptive [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Key Concepts and Components

### 1. Decision Support Systems
Discretionary algorithms often rely on [decision support systems](../d/decision_support_systems.md), which are tools that provide traders with analytical insights and data-driven recommendations. These systems can analyze vast amounts of data more quickly than a human can, [offering](../o/offering.md) valuable information that traders can use to make more informed decisions. Examples of decision support might include complex charting tools, [pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) systems, and [predictive analytics](../p/predictive_analytics.md).

### 2. Human Judgment
The primary differentiating [factor](../f/factor.md) of discretionary algorithms is the [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) of human [judgment](../j/judgment.md). This can be particularly valuable in situations where [market](../m/market.md) conditions are rapidly changing and may involve factors that algorithms are not equipped to [handle](../h/handle.md), such as [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md) or breaking news. Traders using discretionary algorithms can intervene to adjust or halt automated processes based on their interpretations and expertise.

### 3. Rule-Based Frameworks
While discretionary algorithms involve human oversight, they often operate within rule-based frameworks to ensure consistency and discipline. These rules can include entry and exit points, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) protocols, and other predefined criteria designed to guide human intervention. The rules provide a structured environment that minimizes emotional or irrational decision-making.

### 4. Flexibility and Adaptability
One of the significant advantages of discretionary algorithms is their flexibility. Unlike rigid automated systems, discretionary approaches can adapt to unforeseen [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Traders can modify strategies in real-time, making it possible to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on opportunities or mitigate losses that strictly rule-based systems might miss.

### 5. Risk Management
Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial in discretionary [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Traders must constantly monitor and manage [risk](../r/risk.md) exposures, ensuring that interventions do not lead to excessive losses. Discretionary algorithms often include [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools that provide alerts and recommendations based on current trading conditions.

### 6. Data Sources and Analytic Tools
Discretionary algorithms [leverage](../l/leverage.md) various data sources and analytic tools to inform trading decisions. These can include [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md), [historical data analysis](../h/historical_data_analysis.md), [sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) from news sources, and [social media](../s/social_media.md) trends. The integration of diverse data sources allows traders to have a comprehensive view of [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

## Application and Strategy

### 1. Technical Analysis
Traders using discretionary algorithms often rely heavily on [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), employing various [charting techniques](../c/charting_techniques.md) to identify potential trading opportunities. Indicators such as moving averages, RSI ([Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md)), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md)) are commonly used within these systems, although the final trading decisions are made by humans.

### 2. Fundamental Analysis
[Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) can also play a significant role in [discretionary trading](../d/discretionary_trading.md) strategies. Traders might use [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), and other fundamental data points to inform their decisions. The combination of fundamental insights with algorithmic data processing enables a more holistic approach to [market](../m/market.md) analysis.

### 3. Hybrid Strategies
Hybrid strategies combine automated [execution](../e/execution.md) with discretionary oversight, allowing traders to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the speed and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of algorithms while retaining the ability to override or adjust trades based on real-time information. This approach is particularly beneficial in volatile or unpredictable markets.

### 4. Portfolio Management
Discretionary algorithms are used extensively in [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md). Traders can adjust portfolio allocations based on [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and other factors. This dynamic approach helps in optimizing returns while managing [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.

### 5. Proprietary Trading Firms
Some [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms focus on developing discretionary algorithms to [gain](../g/gain.md) a competitive edge. These firms invest in sophisticated technology and hire experienced traders to implement and oversee these systems. Proprietary firms may also experiment with various algorithms to enhance their [discretionary trading](../d/discretionary_trading.md) strategies.
