# Discretionary Algorithms

**Discretionary Algorithms** refer to a type of [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) where the decision-making process involves significant human oversight or intervention. Unlike fully automated or mechanical [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), which execute predefined rules without human input, discretionary algorithms allow traders to use their judgment and discretion at various stages of the trading process. This hybrid approach combines the strengths of both human intuition and computational power, enabling more flexible and adaptive [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Key Concepts and Components

### 1. Decision Support Systems
Discretionary algorithms often rely on [decision support systems](../d/decision_support_systems.md), which are tools that provide traders with analytical insights and data-driven recommendations. These systems can analyze vast amounts of data more quickly than a human can, offering valuable information that traders can use to make more informed decisions. Examples of decision support might include complex charting tools, [pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) systems, and [predictive analytics](../p/predictive_analytics.md).

### 2. Human Judgment
The primary differentiating factor of discretionary algorithms is the incorporation of human judgment. This can be particularly valuable in situations where market conditions are rapidly changing and may involve factors that algorithms are not equipped to handle, such as [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md) or breaking news. Traders using discretionary algorithms can intervene to adjust or halt automated processes based on their interpretations and expertise.

### 3. Rule-Based Frameworks
While discretionary algorithms involve human oversight, they often operate within rule-based frameworks to ensure consistency and discipline. These rules can include entry and exit points, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) protocols, and other predefined criteria designed to guide human intervention. The rules provide a structured environment that minimizes emotional or irrational decision-making.

### 4. Flexibility and Adaptability
One of the significant advantages of discretionary algorithms is their flexibility. Unlike rigid automated systems, discretionary approaches can adapt to unforeseen market conditions. Traders can modify strategies in real-time, making it possible to capitalize on opportunities or mitigate losses that strictly rule-based systems might miss.

### 5. Risk Management
Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial in discretionary [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Traders must constantly monitor and manage risk exposures, ensuring that interventions do not lead to excessive losses. Discretionary algorithms often include [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools that provide alerts and recommendations based on current trading conditions.

### 6. Data Sources and Analytic Tools
Discretionary algorithms leverage various data sources and analytic tools to inform trading decisions. These can include [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md), [historical data analysis](../h/historical_data_analysis.md), [sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) from news sources, and social media trends. The integration of diverse data sources allows traders to have a comprehensive view of market dynamics.

## Application and Strategy

### 1. Technical Analysis
Traders using discretionary algorithms often rely heavily on [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), employing various [charting techniques](../c/charting_techniques.md) to identify potential trading opportunities. Indicators such as moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) are commonly used within these systems, although the final trading decisions are made by humans.

### 2. Fundamental Analysis
[Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) can also play a significant role in [discretionary trading](../d/discretionary_trading.md) strategies. Traders might use earnings reports, [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), and other fundamental data points to inform their decisions. The combination of fundamental insights with algorithmic data processing enables a more holistic approach to market analysis.

### 3. Hybrid Strategies
Hybrid strategies combine automated execution with discretionary oversight, allowing traders to capitalize on the speed and efficiency of algorithms while retaining the ability to override or adjust trades based on real-time information. This approach is particularly beneficial in volatile or unpredictable markets.

### 4. Portfolio Management
Discretionary algorithms are used extensively in [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md). Traders can adjust portfolio allocations based on [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), market conditions, and other factors. This dynamic approach helps in optimizing returns while managing risk effectively.

### 5. Proprietary Trading Firms
Some [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms focus on developing discretionary algorithms to gain a competitive edge. These firms invest in sophisticated technology and hire experienced traders to implement and oversee these systems. Proprietary firms may also experiment with various algorithms to enhance their [discretionary trading](../d/discretionary_trading.md) strategies.
