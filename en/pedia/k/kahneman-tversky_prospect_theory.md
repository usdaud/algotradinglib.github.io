# Kahneman-Tversky Prospect Theory

Kahneman-Tversky [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md), developed by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, provides a [robust](../r/robust.md) framework for understanding decision-making under [risk](../r/risk.md) and [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). Published in their seminal 1979 paper "[Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md): An Analysis of Decision under [Risk](../r/risk.md)," the theory challenges the long-standing Expected [Utility Theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) (EUT) by incorporating psychological insights into economic models.

### Key Elements of Prospect Theory

**1. [Value](../v/value.md) Function:**
[Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) posits that people evaluate potential losses and gains relative to a reference point, often their current position, rather than in absolute terms. The [value](../v/value.md) function is:
- **Concave for gains:** Indicates [risk](../r/risk.md) aversion where people prefer certain smaller gains over risky larger gains.
- **Convex for losses:** Signifies [risk](../r/risk.md)-seeking behavior where people are more inclined to gamble to avoid a certain loss.
- **Steeper for losses than for gains:** This steepness embodies "[loss aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md)," meaning losses impact individuals more significantly than an equivalent amount of gains. Empirically, losses can be perceived as twice as impactful as gains.

**2. Probability Weighting:**
[Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) also underscores that people do not perceive probabilities linearly. They tend to overweigh small probabilities and underweigh moderate to high probabilities, leading to systematic biases in decision-making under [risk](../r/risk.md):
- **Overweighting of small probabilities:** For example, people might over-invest in low-probability assets like lottery tickets.
- **Underweighting of moderate and high probabilities:** Conversely, they may shy away from high-probability, low-[return](../r/return.md) investments.

### Applications in Algorithmic Trading

[Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md)'s insights have significant implications for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). [Trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) premised on classical EUT might not account for [investor](../i/investor.md) behavior realistically. Integrating [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) can enhance [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) by embedding psychological realism, potentially leading to more [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

**1. [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):**
- Tailor stop-loss mechanisms that account for traders' propensity toward [risk](../r/risk.md)-seeking in loss scenarios.
- Design reward strategies that balance [risk](../r/risk.md) aversion in gains to optimize trading decisions.

**2. [Behavioral Finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) Models:**
- Develop models incorporating scenario planning and [simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md) that reflect non-linear probability weighting to predict [market](../m/market.md) movements more accurately.
- Use historical behavior adjusted through the lens of [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) to identify predictive behavioral patterns and anomalies.

### Limitations and Criticisms

**1. Empirical Challenges:**
While [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) is [robust](../r/robust.md) in explaining individual decision-making, translating these insights into [market](../m/market.md)-wide prediction models remains empirically challenging due to the collective nature of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) where diverse [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md) intersect.

**2. Complexity in Application:**
The multi-factorial nature of [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md), with its dual-process evaluation ([value](../v/value.md) function and probability weighting), necessitates sophisticated computational models and extensive historical data to parameterize accurately, posing computational and operational challenges.

**3. Evolution of [Market](../m/market.md) Behavior:**
Human behavior is dynamic; [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) participants' [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md) evolve with [market](../m/market.md) and informational contexts, necessitating continual refinements in models based on [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) to remain effective.

### Implementations in Trading Software

Several trading platforms and financial software companies have begun integrating [behavioral finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) principles, including [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md), to enhance their [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md):

**Betterment:**
[https://www.betterment.com](https://www.betterment.com)

Betterment uses [behavioral finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) principles to construct and manage personalized investment portfolios for clients. By understanding the psychological traits influencing human behavior, Betterment aims to mitigate irrational trading decisions clients might otherwise make instinctively.

**Wealthfront:**
[https://www.wealthfront.com](https://www.wealthfront.com)

Wealthfront integrates behavioral insights to [offer](../o/offer.md) automated investment services that align more closely with how people perceive gains and losses, aiming to improve clients' investment experiences and outcomes.

### Future Perspectives

[Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md)'s [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) in [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) opens new horizons for research and application:
- **[Artificial Intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):** Utilize AI and ML to dynamically adapt [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) based on real-time behavioral data, enhancing model accuracy and predictive power.
- **Quantitative [Behavioral Finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md):** Expand [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) integrating [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) to simulate [market](../m/market.md) scenarios, thus refining [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) frameworks.
- **Enhanced Personalization:** Tailor investment advice and [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) services more finely to individual [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md), blending quantitative data with behavioral insights for optimal outcomes.

In conclusion, Kahneman-Tversky [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) offers a transformative lens through which to view decision-making under [risk](../r/risk.md), challenging traditional economic models by embedding psychological realism. While its implementation in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) presents challenges, its potential to enhance predictive accuracy and align [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) with real-world [investor](../i/investor.md) behavior marks a significant advancement in [financial modeling](../f/financial_modeling.md) and trading practices.
