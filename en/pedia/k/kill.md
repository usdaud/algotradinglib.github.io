# Kill

## Definition
In the financial context, **Kill** refers to the action of canceling or terminating a financial [order](../o/order.md) or [transaction](../t/transaction.md) before it is executed. This term is often used in trading to describe the act of canceling a [trade](../t/trade.md) [order](../o/order.md) that has not yet been fulfilled.

## Key Components
1. **[Order](../o/order.md) Cancellation**: The process of stopping a [trade](../t/trade.md) [order](../o/order.md) that has been placed but not yet executed.
2. **Immediate Action**: Kill orders are typically executed immediately to prevent the [trade](../t/trade.md) from going through.
3. **Trading Platforms**: Most trading platforms and [brokerage services](../b/brokerage_services.md) provide the functionality to kill orders.

## Importance
1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Allows traders to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) by canceling orders that may no longer be desirable due to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
2. **Flexibility**: Provides traders with the flexibility to adapt their strategies in real-time.
3. **Preventing Losses**: Helps in preventing potential losses that could occur if the [market](../m/market.md) moves unfavorably after the [order](../o/order.md) was placed.

## Example Scenarios
1. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: A [trader](../t/trader.md) places a buy [order](../o/order.md) for a stock, but due to sudden [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), decides to kill the [order](../o/order.md) to avoid buying at an unfavorable price.
2. **Incorrect [Order](../o/order.md) Entry**: An [investor](../i/investor.md) realizes they entered incorrect information for a [trade](../t/trade.md) [order](../o/order.md) and kills the [order](../o/order.md) to correct it before it is executed.
3. **Change in Strategy**: A [trader](../t/trader.md) revises their [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) based on new information and kills all pending orders that do not align with the updated strategy.

## Types of Kill Orders
1. **Kill or Cancel (KOC)**: An instruction to cancel an [order](../o/order.md) immediately if it cannot be filled right away.
2. **Immediate or Cancel (IOC)**: An [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) that must be executed immediately. Any portion of the [order](../o/order.md) that cannot be filled immediately is canceled.
3. **Fill or Kill (FOK)**: An [order](../o/order.md) that must be executed in its entirety immediately. If the [order](../o/order.md) cannot be filled in full, it is canceled.

## Challenges
1. **Timing**: The effectiveness of a kill [order](../o/order.md) depends on the timing and speed of [execution](../e/execution.md), which can be influenced by [market](../m/market.md) conditions and the [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md).
2. **Partial Fills**: Orders might be partially filled before they are killed, leading to unintended positions.
3. **Technical Issues**: System delays or technical glitches could prevent a kill [order](../o/order.md) from being processed immediately.

## Best Practices
1. **Monitor Orders**: Regularly monitor pending orders to ensure they align with current [market](../m/market.md) conditions and [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
2. **Use Advanced Orders**: Utilize advanced [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) like IOC and FOK to manage the [execution](../e/execution.md) and cancellation of orders more effectively.
3. **Stay Informed**: Keep up-to-date with [market](../m/market.md) news and conditions that could impact the desirability of pending orders.

## Conclusion
The term "Kill" in the financial context refers to the action of canceling a financial [order](../o/order.md) or [transaction](../t/transaction.md) before it is executed. This practice is essential for managing [risk](../r/risk.md), providing flexibility, and preventing potential losses in volatile [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Understanding the types, challenges, and [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) associated with kill orders can help traders and investors effectively manage their trading activities.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Kill and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Kill as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Kill, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.
