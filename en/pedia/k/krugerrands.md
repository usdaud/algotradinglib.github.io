# Krugerrands

## Introduction to Krugerrands

Krugerrands are one of the most recognized and widely traded gold coins in the world. They are produced by the South African Mint and were first introduced in 1967 to help [market](../m/market.md) South African gold. The coin is named after Paul Kruger, a former President of the South African Republic, and "rand," the South African [currency](../c/currency.md).

## Historical Context

### Inception and Purpose

The Krugerrand was introduced at a time when private ownership of gold bullion was restricted in many countries. However, the ownership of gold coins, which were considered a [legal tender](../l/legal_tender.md), was permitted. This allowed investors to circumvent these restrictions and invest in gold-backed assets, making the Krugerrand an appealing option.

### Rise to Dominance

By the 1980s, Krugerrands accounted for about 90% of the global gold coin [market](../m/market.md). Around 50 million ounces of gold in Krugerrand coins had been sold by the end of the 20th century.

### Sanctions and Decline

During the 1980s, international sanctions against South Africa due to its Apartheid policies caused a decline in the availability and acceptance of Krugerrands. Many Western countries, including the United States, banned the importation of Krugerrands.

### Resurgence

Post-Apartheid, the sanctions were lifted, and the Krugerrand [market](../m/market.md) saw a resurgence. Newer versions, including Silver Krugerrands, were introduced to attract a wider array of investors.
