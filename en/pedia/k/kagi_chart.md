# Kagi Chart

The Kagi Chart is a type of chart that differs from the traditional bar or [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) charts typically used to illustrate price movements in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Instead of plotting price against uniform time intervals, a Kagi Chart changes its trajectory only when price movements exceed a specified threshold. This unique characteristic allows the chart to focus on significant price changes and trends, filtering out minor [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations and [noise](../n/noise.md). Developed in Japan, Kagi Charts are widely utilized in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) for making trading decisions and are particularly effective in identifying trends and reversals.

## Features of Kagi Charts

### 1. Price Movement Based
Kagi Charts are driven by price movements rather than time intervals. Consequently, they provide a clearer view of the [market](../m/market.md)'s [trend](../t/trend.md) by filtering out insignificant price fluctuations.

### 2. Line Thickness
The chart's lines change thickness to signify shifts between 'yang' lines (thicker, upward lines) and 'yin' lines (thinner, downward lines), based on whether the [market](../m/market.md) is bullish or bearish.

### 3. Reversal Criteria
A Kagi Chart reverses direction and changes its line thickness when the price motion surpasses a predefined [reversal](../r/reversal.md) amount, called the "[reversal](../r/reversal.md) criterion." This can be an absolute price difference or a percentage of the current price.

### 4. No Fixed Time Axis
Unlike conventional charts, Kagi Charts do not have a fixed time axis. The focus is entirely on significant price movements.

## Interpretation of Kagi Charts

### Yin and Yang Lines
- **Yang (Thick) Lines:** Indicate a strong bullish [market](../m/market.md).
- **Yin (Thin) Lines:** Indicate a bearish [market](../m/market.md).

### Kagi Turning Points
- **[Reversal](../r/reversal.md) Points:** When a yin (downward) line transforms into a yang (upward) line, indicating a buy signal. Conversely, when a yang line transforms into a yin line, it indicates a sell signal.

### Support and Resistance Levels
Kagi Charts naturally incorporate [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, making it easier to identify potential entry and exit points for trading.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
1. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Identification:** Kagi Charts excel in identifying and confirming [trend](../t/trend.md) movements.
2. **[Noise](../n/noise.md) Reduction:** By focusing only on significant price changes, Kagi Charts filter out the [noise](../n/noise.md) inherent in many markets.
3. **Adaptability:** Different [reversal](../r/reversal.md) criteria can be applied based on the [asset class](../a/asset_class.md) and [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

### Disadvantages
1. **Complexity:** The lack of uniform time intervals can make Kagi Charts harder to interpret for beginners.
2. **Lag in Signals:** Due to the need for significant price movements to trigger line changes, Kagi Charts may lag in providing timely signals during rapid [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations.
3. **Customization Required:** The effectiveness of Kagi Charts is dependent on the correct setting of the [reversal](../r/reversal.md) criterion, which may require customization.

## Steps to Create a Kagi Chart

1. **Select an [Asset](../a/asset.md):** Choose the [asset](../a/asset.md) for which you want to create the Kagi Chart.
2. **Specify [Reversal](../r/reversal.md) Criteria:** Set the [reversal](../r/reversal.md) criterion, which could be a fixed amount (e.g., $1) or a percentage.
3. **Plot Initial Line:** Start plotting from the initial price.
4. **Monitor Price Movements:** Plot vertical lines representing price movements. Horizontal lines are drawn only when the price changes direction.
5. **Change Line Thickness:** Adjust line thickness when prices cross previous highs (for yang lines) or lows (for yin lines).

## Example Analysis using a Kagi Chart

Imagine analyzing a stock with the following price movements:

- Start at $100
- Move up to $105
- Drop to $98
- Rise to $110
- Drop to $103

### Step-by-Step Plotting
1. **Initial Line** at $100: Start with a yang line.
2. **Price Moves to $105:** Vertical yang line extends upwards.
3. **Price Drops to $98:** If the [reversal](../r/reversal.md) criterion (e.g., $3) is met, switch to a yang to yin line.
4. **Price Rises to $110:** As it exceeds the previous $105 high, switch back to a yang line.
5. **Price Falls to $103:** Maintain a yang line if the fall does not meet the [reversal](../r/reversal.md) criterion.

## Integrating Kagi Charts with Other Indicators

### 1. Moving Averages
Combine Kagi Charts with moving averages to smooth out price actions and spot [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals.

### 2. Volume Analysis
Utilize [volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) alongside Kagi Charts to confirm the strength of a [trend](../t/trend.md) or [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

### 3. Fibonacci Retracements
Incorporate Fibonacci levels to identify potential [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) areas in conjunction with Kagi Charts.

## Real-world Applications

### 1. Stock Market
Kagi Charts are widely used in stock trading to identify long-term trends and potential [breakout](../b/breakout.md) points.

### 2. Forex Trading
In forex trading, Kagi Charts help in assessing [currency](../c/currency.md) pair movements and identifying optimal entry and exit points.

### 3. Commodity Trading
Traders rely on Kagi Charts to track commodities like gold and oil, filtering out short-term [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to focus on broader trends.

## Conclusion

Kagi Charts provide a unique and effective way to analyze price movements by focusing on significant shifts rather than time intervals. Their ability to filter out [market](../m/market.md) [noise](../n/noise.md) and highlight trends makes them valuable for traders aiming to make informed decisions. Despite their complexity and potential lag in signal generation, when used in conjunction with other indicators and customized correctly, Kagi Charts can be a powerful tool in a [trader](../t/trader.md)'s arsenal.
