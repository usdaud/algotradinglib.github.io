# Keras

Keras is a high-level [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) API written in Python that runs on top of [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) frameworks such as [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md). It is designed to enable fast experimentation and ease of use, making it accessible for beginners and experts alike.

### Key Components
- **User-Friendly API:** Simplifies model building with intuitive, modular components.
- **Predefined Layers and Models:** Offers a wide [range](../r/range.md) of layers, optimizers, and loss functions.
- **Backend Flexibility:** Can run on [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md), Theano, or CNTK.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Facilitates quick development and testing of models.

### Applications
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Developing and testing neural [network models](../n/network_models_in_trading.md) quickly.
- **Educational Purposes:** Widely used in academia for teaching [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) concepts.
- **Production Deployment:** Transitioning from prototype to production with minimal adjustments.
- **[Computer Vision](../c/computer_vision.md) & NLP:** Building models for image recognition, text classification, and more.

### Advantages
- Extremely user-friendly and accessible.
- High-level abstraction reduces the need for low-level programming.
- Strong integration with [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md) enhances [scalability](../s/scalability.md) and deployment.

### Challenges
- May lack the flexibility of lower-level frameworks for highly customized models.
- Can be slower for certain operations compared to more optimized code.
- Abstracts away details that might be important for advanced users.

### Future Outlook
Keras continues to be an essential tool for both beginners and professionals. Future updates are expected to further integrate with [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md) 2.x and beyond, [offering](../o/offering.md) more advanced features without sacrificing its simplicity.
