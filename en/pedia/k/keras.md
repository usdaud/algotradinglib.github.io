# Keras

Keras is a high-level [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) API written in Python that runs on top of [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) frameworks such as [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md). It is designed to enable fast experimentation and ease of use, making it accessible for beginners and experts alike.

### Key Components
- **User-Friendly API:** Simplifies model building with intuitive, modular components.
- **Predefined Layers and Models:** Offers a wide [range](../r/range.md) of layers, optimizers, and loss functions.
- **Backend Flexibility:** Can run on [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md), Theano, or CNTK.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Facilitates quick development and testing of models.

### Applications
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Developing and testing neural [network models](../n/network_models_in_trading.md) quickly.
- **Educational Purposes:** Widely used in academia for teaching [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) concepts.
- **Production Deployment:** Transitioning from prototype to production with minimal adjustments.
- **[Computer Vision](../c/computer_vision.md) & NLP:** Building models for image recognition, text classification, and more.

### Advantages
- Extremely user-friendly and accessible.
- High-level abstraction reduces the need for low-level programming.
- Strong integration with [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md) enhances [scalability](../s/scalability.md) and deployment.

### Challenges
- May lack the flexibility of lower-level frameworks for highly customized models.
- Can be slower for certain operations compared to more optimized code.
- Abstracts away details that might be important for advanced users.

### Future Outlook
Keras continues to be an essential tool for both beginners and professionals. Future updates are expected to further integrate with [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md) 2.x and beyond, [offering](../o/offering.md) more advanced features without sacrificing its simplicity.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Keras and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Keras as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Keras, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Keras. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Keras alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
