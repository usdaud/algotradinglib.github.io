# Kicking The Tires

## Definition
**Kicking the Tires** is a colloquial expression used in the financial and investment community to describe the process of conducting a preliminary evaluation or [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) on an investment opportunity, company, or [asset](../a/asset.md). It involves a superficial or initial assessment to get a basic understanding before committing to a more detailed and thorough analysis.

## Key Components
1. **Initial Evaluation**: The initial, often informal, assessment of the investment or [asset](../a/asset.md).
2. **Basic Understanding**: Gaining a general sense of the potential risks, benefits, and overall viability of the opportunity.
3. **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md)**: A precursor to more in-depth [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) if the initial evaluation indicates potential [value](../v/value.md).

## Importance
1. **Screening**: Helps investors and analysts quickly screen potential investments to determine if they [warrant](../w/warrant.md) further investigation.
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Provides an early indication of possible red flags or obvious issues that could affect the investment's viability.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Ensures that time and resources are focused on opportunities with the highest potential [return](../r/return.md) by filtering out less promising ones early in the process.

## Example Scenarios
1. **[Venture Capital](../v/venture_capital.md)**: A venture capitalist meets with a [startup](../s/startup.md)'s founders and reviews their pitch deck to get a basic understanding of the [business](../b/business.md) before deciding whether to proceed with more detailed [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md).
2. **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment**: An [investor](../i/investor.md) visits a property to visually inspect its condition and location before committing to a more comprehensive property inspection and [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md).
3. **Stock Investment**: An individual [investor](../i/investor.md) reviews a company's recent [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and [market](../m/market.md) performance to get an initial sense of its investment potential before diving into a deeper analysis.

## Process of Kicking the Tires
1. **Initial Research**: Conduct basic research on the investment opportunity, such as reviewing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), [business](../b/business.md) plans, or [market](../m/market.md) trends.
2. **Visual Inspection**: If applicable, perform a physical inspection of the [asset](../a/asset.md) or property to assess its condition and suitability.
3. **Preliminary Questions**: Ask initial questions to the company's management or representatives to clarify basic details and understand the fundamental aspects of the [business](../b/business.md).
4. **Red Flags Identification**: Look for obvious red flags or issues that could indicate problems or reduce the attractiveness of the investment.

## Challenges
1. **Superficial Assessment**: The process is inherently superficial and may miss critical details that could affect the investment's outcome.
2. **Bias**: Initial impressions can be biased, leading to potentially hasty decisions without comprehensive analysis.
3. **Incomplete Information**: Access to limited information during the initial evaluation may result in an incomplete picture of the investment opportunity.

## Best Practices
1. **Structured Approach**: Use a structured checklist to ensure all basic aspects are covered during the initial evaluation.
2. **Objectivity**: Maintain objectivity and avoid making definitive decisions based solely on the initial assessment.
3. **Follow-Up**: If the initial evaluation is positive, proceed with a more detailed and comprehensive [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) process to validate initial findings.
4. **Consult Experts**: When necessary, consult with [industry](../i/industry.md) experts or professionals to [gain](../g/gain.md) additional insights during the initial evaluation.
