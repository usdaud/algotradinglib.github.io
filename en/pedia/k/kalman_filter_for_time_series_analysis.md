# Kalman Filter for Time Series Analysis

The [Kalman Filter](../k/kalman_filter_in_trading.md) is a powerful tool that provides estimates of the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. It is widely used in various fields including engineering, [economics](../e/economics.md), and [finance](../f/finance.md). One of its notable applications is in [time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md) and [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md), essential for developing [quantitative trading](../q/quantitative_trading.md) strategies in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

## Introduction to Kalman Filter

The [Kalman Filter](../k/kalman_filter_in_trading.md), named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, which contains statistical [noise](../n/noise.md) and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates that tend to be more precise than those based on a single measurement alone. This is achieved through the combination of predictions from a system model and updates from new observations.

### Key Concepts and Equations

The [Kalman Filter](../k/kalman_filter_in_trading.md) operates through a cycle of predict and update steps, which can be mathematically defined as follows:

1. **Prediction Step:**

    - **State Estimate Prediction:**
      \[
      \mathbf{\hat{x}}_k^- = \mathbf{F}_k \mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1} + \mathbf{B}_k \mathbf{u}_k
      \]
      where:
      - \(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k^-\) is the predicted state at time \(k\).
      - \(\mathbf{F}_k\) is the state transition model applied to the previous state.
      - \(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}\) is the estimated state from the previous step.
      - \(\mathbf{B}_k\) is the control-input model applied to the control vector.
      - \(\mathbf{u}_k\) is the control vector.

    - **Error [Covariance](../c/covariance.md) Prediction:**
      \[
      \mathbf{P}_k^- = \mathbf{F}_k \mathbf{P}_{k-1} \mathbf{F}_k^T + \mathbf{Q}_k
      \]
      where:
      - \(\mathbf{P}_k^-\) is the predicted error [covariance](../c/covariance.md).
      - \(\mathbf{F}_k\) is the same state transition model.
      - \(\mathbf{P}_{k-1}\) is the previous error [covariance](../c/covariance.md).
      - \(\mathbf{Q}_k\) is the process [noise](../n/noise.md) [covariance](../c/covariance.md).

2. **Update Step:**

    - **[Kalman Gain](../k/kalman_gain_in_trading.md) Calculation:**
      \[
      \mathbf{K}_k = \mathbf{P}_k^- \mathbf{H}_k^T (\mathbf{H}_k \mathbf{P}_k^- \mathbf{H}_k^T + \mathbf{R}_k)^{-1}
      \]
      where:
      - \(\mathbf{K}_k\) is the [Kalman Gain](../k/kalman_gain_in_trading.md).
      - \(\mathbf{P}_k^-\) is the predicted error [covariance](../c/covariance.md).
      - \(\mathbf{H}_k\) is the observation model.
      - \(\mathbf{R}_k\) is the observation [noise](../n/noise.md) [covariance](../c/covariance.md).

    - **State Estimate Update:**
      \[
      \mathbf{\hat{x}}_k = \mathbf{\hat{x}}_k^- + \mathbf{K}_k (\mathbf{z}_k - \mathbf{H}_k \mathbf{\hat{x}}_k^-)
      \]
      where:
      - \(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k\) is the updated state estimate.
      - \(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k^-\) is the predicted state estimate.
      - \(\mathbf{z}_k\) is the measurement at time \(k\).
      - \(\mathbf{H}_k\) is the same observation model.

    - **Error [Covariance](../c/covariance.md) Update:**
      \[
      \mathbf{P}_k = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{K}_k \mathbf{H}_k) \mathbf{P}_k^-
      \]
      where:
      - \(\mathbf{P}_k\) is the updated error [covariance](../c/covariance.md).
      - \(\mathbf{I}\) is the identity matrix.

## Kalman Filter in Time Series Analysis

In [time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md), the [Kalman Filter](../k/kalman_filter_in_trading.md) is primarily used for filtering and predicting future values, smooth past values, and estimate missing observations. Its strength lies in its ability to provide optimal estimates in the presence of uncertainties and [noise](../n/noise.md), which is common in financial [market](../m/market.md) data.

### Application in Financial Markets

1. **State-Space Representation**: 
    [Financial time series](../f/financial_time_series.md) can be represented in a state-space form where the observable variables (e.g., [asset](../a/asset.md) prices) are modeled as functions of hidden state variables (e.g., [underlying](../u/underlying.md) trends, seasonal components).

2. **Filtering and Smoothing**: 
    - **Filtering**: This involves estimating the current states of the system based on past and present data.
    - **Smoothing**: This involves estimating the states of the system over time, incorporating future observations to improve past estimates.

3. **[Noise](../n/noise.md) Reduction**:
   [Kalman Filter](../k/kalman_filter_in_trading.md) helps to reduce the [noise](../n/noise.md) in [financial time series](../f/financial_time_series.md), providing a cleaner signal for identifying trends and patterns.

4. **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) Strategies**:
   Traders can use the [Kalman Filter](../k/kalman_filter_in_trading.md) to develop prediction models for prices, volatilities, and returns. This can form the [basis](../b/basis.md) for a variety of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), including [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md), and [trend following](../t/trend_following.md).

### Implementation Example

Below is an example implementation of the [Kalman Filter](../k/kalman_filter_in_trading.md) in Python, using a state-space representation for a simple [financial time series](../f/financial_time_series.md) model:

```python
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np

# Define parameters
n_iter = 50
sz = (n_iter,)  # size of array
x = -0.37727   # truth [value](../v/value.md) (typo in example at top of p. 13 calls this z)
z = np.random.normal(x, 0.1, size=sz)  # observations (normal about x, sigma=0.1)

Q = 1e-5  # process variance

# allocate space for arrays
xhat = np.zeros(sz)      # a posteri estimate of x
P = np.zeros(sz)         # a posteri error estimate
xhatminus = np.zeros(sz) # a priori estimate of x
Pminus = np.zeros(sz)    # a priori error estimate
K = np.zeros(sz)         # [gain](../g/gain.md) or blending [factor](../f/factor.md)

R = 0.1**2  # estimate of measurement variance, change to see effect

# initial guesses
xhat[0] = 0.0
P[0] = 1.0

for k in [range](../r/range.md)(1, n_iter):
    # time update
    xhatminus[k] = xhat[k-1]
    Pminus[k] = P[k-1]+Q

    # measurement update
    K[k] = Pminus[k]/(Pminus[k]+R)
    xhat[k] = xhatminus[k]+K[k]*(z[k]-xhatminus[k])
    P[k] = (1-K[k])*Pminus[k]

[import](../i/import.md) matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure()
plt.plot(z,'k+',label='noisy measurements')
plt.plot(xhat,'b-',label='a posteri estimate')
plt.axhline(x,color='g',label='truth [value](../v/value.md)')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Estimate vs. Noisy Measurements')
plt.show()
```
