# Embezzlement

## Definition and Overview

Embezzlement is a form of financial [fraud](../f/fraud.md) involving the unauthorized taking or misappropriation of property or funds by a person entrusted with its possession and control. Typically, this individual holds a position of [trust](../t/trust.md) or responsibility, such as an employee, manager, or an official within an organization. Embezzlement is distinct from theft as the embezzler initially has lawful access to the property and later converts it for personal use.

## Common Techniques and Methods

### Skimming

Skimming involves taking small amounts of [money](../m/money.md) over a period, often so small that the theft goes unnoticed. This method can be challenging to detect without thorough and regular auditing. For instance, a cashier might take a few dollars from the register each day.

### Salami Slicing

This method involves taking tiny fractions of [money](../m/money.md) from many transactions. These fractions are usually so minuscule that they go unnoticed by the victims. A famous example is siphoning off small amounts from [bank](../b/bank.md) transactions to a separate account.

### Payroll Manipulation

In scenarios where embezzlers have access to [payroll](../p/payroll.md) systems, they might create fake employees or manipulate working hours to funnel extra payments to themselves. This is usually detected through irregularities in [payroll](../p/payroll.md) expenses upon comprehensive auditing.

### Check Tampering

Individuals with access to organizational checks might alter legitimate checks or create unauthorized checks to divert company funds into their accounts. This method often involves creating fake checks or altering the [payee](../p/payee.md) details on existing checks.

### Expense Reimbursement

Employees might submit false [expense](../e/expense.md) reports for [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md). This can include inflating actual expenses, submitting fake [receipts](../r/receipt.md), or claiming nonexistent expenses.

## High-Profile Cases and Examples

### Enron Scandal

One of the most notorious embezzlement cases is the Enron scandal. Executives at Enron used complex [accounting](../a/accounting.md) methods to hide the company's [debt](../d/debt.md) and inflate profits on [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), which ultimately led to the company's downfall and the loss of billions for investors.

### Bernie Madoff

[Bernie Madoff](../b/bernie_madoff.md) conducted one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history, embezzling around $65 billion from investors. Madoff's scheme involved paying returns to earlier investors using the [capital](../c/capital.md) inflow from new investors, rather than from [profit](../p/profit.md) earned.

### Rita Crundwell

Rita Crundwell, the former comptroller of Dixon, Illinois, embezzled $53 million from the city over two decades. She used elaborate techniques to siphon funds unnoticed, diverting [money](../m/money.md) meant for city operations into her accounts.

## Legal Implications

### Criminal Charges

Embezzlement is a criminal offense and can lead to serious legal consequences. Charges may include theft, [fraud](../f/fraud.md), or other related crimes, depending on the jurisdiction. Convictions can result in substantial prison time, fines, and restitution orders.

### Civil Consequences

Victims of embezzlement may pursue civil lawsuits to recover the stolen funds. This can include seeking damages for any financial losses or harm suffered due to the embezzlement.

### Penalties

Penalties for embezzlement vary widely based on the amount stolen, the length of time over which the theft occurred, and the relationship between the embezzler and the victim. In severe cases, individuals may face several years of imprisonment, significant fines, and forfeiture of assets.

## Prevention and Detection

### Internal Controls

Organizations can institute [robust](../r/robust.md) [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md) to prevent and detect embezzlement. This can include:

- **Segregation of Duties**: Dividing responsibilities among [multiple](../m/multiple.md) people to ensure no single individual has complete control over financial transactions.
- **Regular Audits**: Conducting regular internal and external audits to identify discrepancies and ensure compliance with [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards.
- **Access Controls**: Restricting access to financial systems and data to authorized personnel only.
- **[Whistleblower](../w/whistleblower.md) Policies**: Establishing procedures for employees to report suspicious activities without fear of retaliation.

### Training and Awareness

Educating employees about the signs of embezzlement and the importance of ethical behavior can help create an organizational culture that discourages dishonest practices.

### Advanced Tools

Leveraging advanced [software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) and technologies, such as [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), can enhance the capability to detect anomalies and fraudulent activities in real-time.

## Impact on Organizations

### Financial Losses

The immediate impact of embezzlement is financial loss. Organizations may lose significant amounts of [money](../m/money.md), which can affect their operations, profitability, and even viability.

### Reputational Damage

When incidents of embezzlement become public, they can severely damage the reputation of the organization. [Trust](../t/trust.md) with customers, investors, and employees may be eroded, leading to further financial and operational challenges.

### Legal Costs

Organizations may incur substantial legal costs associated with investigating embezzlement, prosecuting the offenders, and engaging in civil litigation to recover stolen funds.

### Operational Disruption

Dealing with the aftermath of embezzlement can cause significant disruption to normal [business](../b/business.md) operations. Organizations may need to overhaul their financial processes, hire forensic accountants, and spend time addressing the internal and external fallout of the incident.

## Famous Cases

### Toshiba Accounting Scandal

In 2015, Toshiba was found to have overstated its profits by nearly $1.2 billion over seven years. An independent investigation revealed that top executives had pressured subordinates to manipulate [accounting](../a/accounting.md) records to meet targets.

### Satyam Computer Services Scandal

In 2009, Ramalinga Raju, the founder of Satyam Computer Services, confessed to embezzling $1.5 billion from the company. He admitted to falsifying revenues, margins, and cash balances, creating a significant scandal in the Indian corporate world.

### Société Générale

In 2008, Jérôme Kerviel, a [trader](../t/trader.md) at the French [bank](../b/bank.md) Société Générale, was found to have engaged in unauthorized and fraudulent trades that led to a loss of €4.9 billion. He was accused of exceeding his authorized trading limits and creating fraudulent documents to cover his tracks.

## Modern Examples

### Wells Fargo Scandal

In recent years, Wells Fargo faced scrutiny for creating millions of unauthorized [bank](../b/bank.md) and [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) accounts. Employees, under pressure to meet sales targets, engaged in fraudulent activities that ultimately resulted in significant fines and damage to the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s reputation.

### PNB Fraud Case

In 2018, the Punjab [National Bank](../n/national_bank.md) (PNB) in India uncovered a [fraud](../f/fraud.md) involving unauthorized Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) issued to Nirav Modi. The scam is estimated to have cost the [bank](../b/bank.md) nearly $2 billion, making it one of the largest financial frauds in Indian history.

## Conclusion

Embezzlement remains a significant [risk](../r/risk.md) for organizations worldwide. It involves various techniques and can have severe financial, operational, and reputational impacts. Companies must employ [robust](../r/robust.md) [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md), conduct regular audits, and foster a culture of ethics and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) to prevent and detect such fraudulent activities. Legal consequences for embezzlement are stringent, reflecting its serious nature. Famous cases highlight the diverse ways through which individuals can perpetrate such [fraud](../f/fraud.md), underlining the need for vigilance and proactive measures to safeguard assets and maintain [trust](../t/trust.md).
