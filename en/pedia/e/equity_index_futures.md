# Equity Index Futures

Equity index futures are futures contracts based on stock indexes such as the S and P 500 or the Nasdaq 100. They provide broad market exposure with leverage and efficient execution.

## Key Features
- Cash settled contracts
- Standardized contract sizes and tick values
- High liquidity in major indexes

## Uses
- Hedging equity portfolios
- Gaining market exposure efficiently
- Trading macro events or index level trends

## Trading Considerations
Futures trade nearly 24 hours, so price discovery can occur outside regular equity market hours. Margin requirements and roll schedules are important for risk management.

## Risks
Leverage can amplify losses. During volatile periods, futures can gap significantly, and margin calls can occur quickly.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
