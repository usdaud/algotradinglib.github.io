# Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC)

The Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) is a financial concept used to compare the cost-effectiveness of different investments or projects over a common time period. This is particularly useful when the projects or investments being compared have different lifespans. The EAC allows decision-makers to determine the annual cost of owning, operating, and maintaining a piece of equipment, machine, or any project. By converting all costs into an equivalent annual amount, comparisons become straightforward and more meaningful.

## Definition

EAC is the annualized cost of an investment, including initial [capital expenditure](../c/capital_expenditure.md), operating costs, maintenance costs, and other expenses over the investment’s lifespan, discounted at the company's [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md). The calculation transforms unevenly distributed cash flows into a constant annual figure, making comparison more intuitive.

The formula to compute EAC is:
\[ EAC = \frac{PV}{\text{Annuity [Factor](../f/factor.md) (AF)}} \]

Where:
- \( PV \) = [Present Value](../p/present_value.md) of all cash flows associated with the project.
- \( \text{Annuity [Factor](../f/factor.md) (AF)} \) is calculated using the formula:
 \[ AF = \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \]
 where \( r \) is the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) ([cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md)) and \( n \) is the number of years.

## Calculation Details

To compute the EAC, certain steps must be followed:

1. **Identify all cash flows**: Recognize all initial [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, operating and maintenance costs, and other relevant cash flows associated with the investment.

2. **Compute the [Present Value](../p/present_value.md) (PV)**: [Discount](../d/discount.md) all future cash flows to their [present value](../p/present_value.md) using the company's [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md). This encompasses initial investment, annual cash flows, and terminal or [salvage value](../s/salvage_value.md).

3. **Calculate the Annuity [Factor](../f/factor.md) (AF)**: This [factor](../f/factor.md) helps in converting the lump-sum [present value](../p/present_value.md) into an equal annual amount. It depends on the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) and the number of periods.

4. **Divide PV by AF**: The result [will](../w/will.md) be the EAC, which represents the annual cost of the project or investment.

## Practical Example

Consider a company evaluating two different machines for production, Machine A and Machine B. Machine A costs $100,000 with an expected life of 5 years and annual operating costs of $10,000. Machine B costs $150,000 with an expected life of 8 years and annual operating costs of $8,000. The company's [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) is 10%.

1. **Machine A**:
 - Initial Cost = $100,000
 - [Operating Cost](../o/operating_cost.md) = $10,000 annually for 5 years.
 - Compute PV of operating costs:
 \[ PV = 10,000 \times \left[\frac{1 - (1 + 0.10)^{-5}}{0.10}\right] = 10,000 \times 3.791 = 37,910 \]
 - Total PV = Initial Cost + PV of Operating Costs = $100,000 + $37,910 = $137,910.
 - Calculate AF for 5 years at 10%:
 \[ AF = \frac{1 - (1 + 0.10)^{-5}}{0.10} = 3.791 \]
 - EAC = \( \frac{137,910}{3.791} = 36,372 \)

2. **Machine B**:
 - Initial Cost = $150,000
 - [Operating Cost](../o/operating_cost.md) = $8,000 annually for 8 years.
 - Compute PV of operating costs:
 \[ PV = 8,000 \times \left[\frac{1 - (1 + 0.10)^{-8}}{0.10}\right] = 8,000 \times 5.335 = 42,680 \]
 - Total PV = Initial Cost + PV of Operating Costs = $150,000 + $42,680 = $192,680.
 - Calculate AF for 8 years at 10%:
 \[ AF = \frac{1 - (1 + 0.10)^{-8}}{0.10} = 5.335 \]
 - EAC = \( \frac{192,680}{5.335} = 36,117 \)

From the calculations, Machine B has a lower EAC ($36,117) compared to Machine A ($36,372), making it the more cost-effective choice on an annual [basis](../b/basis.md).

## Applications in Business

### Capital Budgeting

In [capital budgeting](../c/capital_budgeting.md), EAC is used to evaluate equipment replacement, maintenance decisions, and investments in long-term projects. It helps firms choose between different assets by considering the total costs over their useful lives and converting them into an annual figure. This is crucial for making informed investment decisions that align with financial strategies and budgets.

### Lease vs. Buy Decisions

EAC plays a vital role in determining whether to lease or buy an [asset](../a/asset.md). By comparing the EAC of leasing an [asset](../a/asset.md) with the EAC of purchasing it, businesses can decide the option that provides the lowest annual cost, hence achieving cost savings.

### Project Evaluation

When comparing projects with similar purposes but different scales and durations, EAC provides a standard metric for evaluating which project delivers the best [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) on investment, considering all associated costs.

### Asset Replacement Analysis

EAC aids in deciding the optimal time to replace an [asset](../a/asset.md). As assets age, maintenance costs rise. Calculating the EAC for old versus new assets helps determine the [breakeven point](../b/breakeven_point.md) for replacement.

## Limitations

While EAC is a powerful tool, it has limitations:

1. **Assumption of Constant Costs**: EAC assumes that costs remain constant, which may not always be realistic as operational costs can fluctuate.

2. **Accurate [Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md)**: Determining an accurate [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) is crucial but may be challenging, especially in volatile economic environments.

3. **Ignores [Inflation](../i/inflation.md)**: EAC calculations typically exclude the effects of [inflation](../i/inflation.md), which can impact the real [value](../v/value.md) of future cash flows.

4. **No [Income](../i/income.md) Consideration**: EAC focuses solely on costs and does not account for potential [income](../i/income.md) generated from the investment.

## Conclusion

Equivalent Annual Cost is an essential metric in financial decision-making, providing a clear [basis](../b/basis.md) for comparing costs across different investments and projects. By annualizing total costs, EAC simplifies complex evaluations, enabling more straightforward and accurate comparisons. Despite its limitations, EAC remains widely used in industries ranging from [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) to [finance](../f/finance.md), underscoring its [value](../v/value.md) in cost-effective decision-making.
