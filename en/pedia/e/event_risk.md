# Event Risk

Event risk is the risk of significant price moves triggered by scheduled or unscheduled events. Examples include earnings, central bank decisions, geopolitical news, and regulatory announcements.

## Characteristics
- Sudden jumps in price and volatility
- Wider spreads and reduced liquidity
- Increased gap risk

## Managing Event Risk
Traders can reduce exposure by decreasing position size, using options for defined risk, or avoiding holding positions through the event.

## Practical Notes
Event risk is not limited to scheduled events. Unexpected headlines can occur at any time, so risk management should account for gap scenarios.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
