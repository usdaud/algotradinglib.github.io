# Elder Ray Index (ERI)

The Elder Ray Index measures buying and selling pressure by comparing price extremes to an exponential moving average. It consists of two components: Bull Power and Bear Power.

## Formula
EMA = Exponential Moving Average of price
Bull Power = High - EMA
Bear Power = Low - EMA

## Interpretation
- Bull Power above zero indicates buyers are pushing prices above the EMA
- Bear Power below zero indicates sellers are pushing prices below the EMA
- Divergence between price and the power measures can signal reversals

## Use in Trading
Traders use ERI to confirm trends and identify potential turning points. A rising Bull Power during an uptrend supports continuation, while weakening power can signal exhaustion.

## Limitations
The indicator is sensitive to the EMA period. It can generate false signals in choppy markets and should be used with trend filters.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
