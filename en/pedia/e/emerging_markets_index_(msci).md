The MSCI Emerging Markets [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) is one of the most well-regarded and widely used [equity](../e/equity.md) indices worldwide. It is designed by MSCI Inc., a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community. The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) measures the [equity market](../e/equity_market.md) performance in global emerging markets, [offering](../o/offering.md) investors insights into dynamic and growing economies that often present significant growth opportunities despite their higher [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md).

## Overview of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index
The MSCI Emerging Markets [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) encompasses large and [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) companies across 24 emerging [market](../m/market.md) countries, covering various sectors. As of 2023, these countries include Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea, among others. The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) captures approximately 85% of the free [float-adjusted market capitalization](../f/float-adjusted_market_capitalization.md) in each country, aiming to provide a holistic representation of the emerging markets landscape.

The emerging markets are typically characterized by:

2. **Greater [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Emerging markets tend to experience higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) due to political instability, less mature financial systems, and greater exposure to external economic shocks.
3. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) Opportunities**: [Investing](../i/investing.md) in emerging markets allows for [geographical diversification](../g/geographical_diversification.md), potentially reducing overall portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md).
