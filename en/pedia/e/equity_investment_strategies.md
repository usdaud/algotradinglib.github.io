# Equity Investment Strategies

[Equity](../e/equity.md) investment strategies are a cornerstone of modern [finance](../f/finance.md), encompassing a [range](../r/range.md) of methodologies designed to maximize returns through the strategic purchase and management of company [stocks](../s/stock.md).
