# Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)

[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Before [Interest](../i/interest.md), [Taxes](../t/taxes.md), [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), and Amortization, commonly known as EBITDA, is a financial metric used to assess a company's operating performance. Essentially, EBITDA strips out the costs of non-operational factors like [debt](../d/debt.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md), and the [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) of physical and intangible assets. By doing so, it provides a clearer picture of the company's profitability derived strictly from core [business](../b/business.md) operations.

## Components of EBITDA

1. **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Before [Interest](../i/interest.md) and [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) (EBIT)**: This is the starting point of EBITDA. It reflects the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) from operations, before deducing [interest](../i/interest.md) and tax expenses. It is calculated as:
 \[
 EBIT = [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) - Operating Expenses (excluding [interest](../i/interest.md) and [taxes](../t/taxes.md))
 \]

2. **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)**: This reflects the reduction in [value](../v/value.md) of tangible fixed assets like machinery and equipment due to wear and tear over time.

3. **Amortization**: Similar to [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) but applies to the reduction in [value](../v/value.md) of intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, and [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md).

EBITDA is derived by adding [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization back to EBIT:
\[
EBITDA = EBIT + [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) + Amortization
\]

## Importance of EBITDA

### 1. **Assessing Operating Performance**
 - EBITDA provides a clear view of a company's operational profitability before the influence of [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md), tax rates, and physical and [intangible asset](../i/intangible_asset.md) amortization.

### 2. **Comparative Analysis**
 - It allows for more straightforward comparisons between companies, particularly those differing in structure, [taxation](../t/taxation.md), or [capital expenditure](../c/capital_expenditure.md) levels.

### 3. **Investment Decisions**
 - Investors use EBITDA to gauge a company’s profitability potential and to compare companies in terms of [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).

### 4. **Credit Analysis**
 - Lenders and bondholders might consider EBITDA to assess the ability of a company to pay back its loans.

### 5. **Valuation**
 - EBITDA is used in [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metrics like the Enterprise [Value](../v/value.md) / EBITDA ratio to assess a company's [value](../v/value.md) independently of its [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md).

## Pros and Cons of EBITDA

### Pros:
 - **Simplicity**: Easy to calculate and understand.
 - **Focus on Operations**: Excludes non-operating expenses, [offering](../o/offering.md) a pure look at [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).
 - **Comparability**: Useful in comparing companies across industries.

### Cons:
 - **Ignores Important Financial Aspects**: Excludes critical expenses like [interest](../i/interest.md), [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures.
 - **Not a [Substitute](../s/substitute.md) for [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)**: EBITDA does not directly correspond to [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) as it does not account for working [capital](../c/capital.md) needs or [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures.
 - **Potential Misuse**: Can be misleading if used alone without other financial metrics.

## Real-world Applications of EBITDA

1. **Amazon**
 - Amazon uses EBITDA consistently in its financial reports to provide insight into its [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md). This allows investors and analysts to focus on its operational performance, which might otherwise be clouded by massive [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures in technology and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).

2. **Netflix**
 - Streaming giant Netflix often reports EBITDA as it helps highlight its operating performance independent of its significant [debt](../d/debt.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and tax structure which vary widely due to international operations.
