# Epsilon

Epsilon is an options Greek that measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the dividend yield or expected dividends of the underlying asset.

## Interpretation
- Higher epsilon means the option is more sensitive to dividend changes
- Call options typically have negative epsilon because higher dividends reduce call values
- Put options typically have positive epsilon because higher dividends increase put values

## Use in Trading
Epsilon matters in dividend heavy stocks and indices. Changes in dividend forecasts can affect option pricing, especially for longer dated contracts.

## Practical Considerations
Dividend assumptions vary across models and brokers. Traders should verify the dividend inputs used in pricing to avoid unexpected valuation differences.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
