# Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) refers to the [range](../r/range.md) of techniques and methods used to increase the amount of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) that can be extracted from an [oil field](../o/oil_field.md). Conventional oil recovery methods typically achieve extraction rates of approximately 20-40% of the oil present in a reservoir. EOR aims to recover an additional 30-60% of the oil, thereby significantly extending the productive life of mature oil fields and maximizing the [return](../r/return.md) on investment.

## Types of Enhanced Oil Recovery Techniques

EOR can be broadly categorized into three main types: Thermal Recovery, Gas Injection, and Chemical Injection.

### Thermal Recovery

Thermal recovery methods involve the introduction of heat to the reservoir to lower the viscosity of the oil, making it easier to extract. This can be achieved through various techniques including:

1. **Steam Injection**: Steam is injected into the oil reservoir to heat the [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) and make it less viscous. Techniques under steam injection include steam soak, steam flooding, and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS).

2. **In-situ Combustion**: Also known as fire flooding, this method involves injecting air or oxygen into the reservoir and igniting a portion of the oil. The resultant combustion generates heat, further lowering the oil viscosity.

3. **Hot Water Flooding**: Involves injecting hot water to displace and mobilize the oil, making it easier to recover.

### Gas Injection

Gas injection methods utilize gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), or natural gas to increase reservoir pressure or to mix with and reduce the viscosity of the oil. Key techniques include:

1. **CO2 Injection**: CO2 is injected into the reservoir where it mixes with the oil, reducing its viscosity and swelling the oil, which enhances its mobility.

2. **Miscible Gas Injection**: Gases such as natural gas or liquefied [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) gas (LPG) are injected; these gases mix with the oil to form a single phase fluid with improved flow characteristics.

3. **Immiscible Gas Injection**: The injected gas does not mix with the oil but helps to maintain or increase reservoir pressure, which helps to push the oil towards production wells.

### Chemical Injection

Chemical injection methods involve the injection of various chemicals into the reservoir to improve oil recovery. Common techniques include:

1. **Polymer Flooding**: Involves injecting polymers, such as polyacrylamides, to increase the viscosity of the displacing water, improving the sweep [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and reducing the mobility ratio.

2. **Surfactant Flooding**: Surfactants are injected to reduce interfacial tension between the oil and water, allowing the trapped oil to be mobilized more easily.

3. **Alkaline Flooding**: Alkaline chemicals react with the organic acids present in the [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) to form surfactants in situ, which help to lower interfacial tension and improve oil recovery.

## EOR Implementation Considerations

When implementing EOR techniques, several factors must be taken into account:

- **Reservoir Characteristics**: Detailed knowledge of reservoir properties, including porosity, permeability, temperature, pressure, and existing oil saturation, is crucial for selecting the appropriate EOR strategy.
- **Economic Viability**: The cost of implementing EOR methods must be weighed against the potential increase in oil recovery and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
- **Environmental Impact**: Some EOR techniques, such as CO2 injection, might contribute positively by utilizing captured industrial CO2, while others may pose environmental risks.
- **Operational Challenges**: The complexity and [logistics](../l/logistics.md) of the chosen EOR method, including the need for specialized equipment and expertise, must be considered.
