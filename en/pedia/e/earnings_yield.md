# Earnings Yield

[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) is a financial metric used to measure the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) generated by a company relative to its share price. It is the inverse of the price-to-[earnings](../e/earnings.md) (P/E) ratio and is expressed as a percentage. The formula for calculating [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) is:

\[ \text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \frac{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS)}}{\text{Share Price}} \times 100\% \]

In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) can be a critical parameter for designing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that aim to identify [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) or predict future price movements based on the company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) performance. This section explores the concept of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) in detail, its importance, how it can be integrated into algo-[trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and real-world applications.

### Importance of Earnings Yield
[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) is an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of how much [profit](../p/profit.md) a company is making for every dollar invested by shareholders. It provides insight into:

1. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: A higher [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) suggests that a stock is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), making it an attractive investment. Conversely, a lower [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) indicates overvaluation.
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment**: [Stocks](../s/stock.md) with higher [earnings](../e/earnings.md) yields are often less risky because they come with a cushion of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) that can absorb potential declines in price.
3. **Comparative Measure**: It enables comparison between different [stocks](../s/stock.md), sectors, or even with fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities like bonds. If a stock's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) is higher than the prevailing [bond yield](../b/bond_yield.md), it could be a more attractive option.

### Calculating Earnings Yield
The calculation of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) involves two primary components: [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS) and the current share price.

1. **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS)**: This is the portion of a company's [profit](../p/profit.md) allocated to each outstanding share. It is calculated as:
\[ \text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income - Dividends on [Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)}}{\text{Average Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md)}} \]

2. **Share Price**: The current trading price of one share of the company's stock.

For example, if a company has an EPS of $5 and its current share price is $50, the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) would be:
\[ \text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \frac{5}{50} \times 100\% = 10\% \]

### Integration into Algorithmic Trading Strategies
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves executing pre-programmed trading instructions based on various [market](../m/market.md) data points. Integrating [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) into these strategies can enhance decision-making processes. Below are some methods to incorporate [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) into algo-[trading models](../t/trading_models.md):

1. **Screening and Filtering**: An algorithm can screen for [stocks](../s/stock.md) with [earnings](../e/earnings.md) yields above a certain threshold, indicating potential undervaluation. For instance, an algorithm might search for [stocks](../s/stock.md) with [earnings](../e/earnings.md) yields above 8%.

2. **[Portfolio Optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md)**: Algorithms can be designed to optimize portfolios by prioritizing [stocks](../s/stock.md) with higher [earnings](../e/earnings.md) yields. This can help in building a portfolio that balances growth and [value](../v/value.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md), potentially leading to better [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

3. **[Predictive Models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md)**: [Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models can use historical [earnings](../e/earnings.md) yields, among other factors, to predict future stock prices or price movements. By analyzing patterns and correlations, these models can generate buy or sell signals.

4. **Pair Trading**: Involving simultaneous buying and selling of related [stocks](../s/stock.md), pair [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) can benefit from [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) by pairing a high-[yield](../y/yield.md) stock with a low-[yield](../y/yield.md) one within the same sector.

5. **[Factor](../f/factor.md)-Based Strategies**: [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) can be one of the [multiple](../m/multiple.md) factors in multifactor [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Combining it with other financial metrics (like P/E ratio, [dividend yield](../d/dividend_yield.md), etc.) can improve the robustness of the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

### Real-World Application
Several firms and platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) tools and algorithms to incorporate [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) into [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). For instance:

1. **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)**: A leading [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platform that provides various tools for developing and [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) strategies.
