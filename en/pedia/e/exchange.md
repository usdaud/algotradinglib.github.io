# Exchange

An exchange is a marketplace where securities, commodities, [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and other financial instruments are traded. It provides a platform for buyers and sellers to conduct transactions, typically within a regulated and organized framework. Exchanges serve as a cornerstone of modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), facilitating [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and greater [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md).

## Types of Exchanges

### Stock Exchanges

Stock exchanges are where [shares](../s/shares.md) of publicly held companies are issued and traded. They enable companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing stock, and provide investors the ability to buy and sell these [shares](../s/shares.md). Examples include:

- **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)**: The largest stock exchange in the world by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) located in New York, USA. NYSE
- **[NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)**: Known for its electronic trading system and [home](../h/home.md) to many tech giants. NASDAQ
- **London Stock Exchange (LSE)**: One of the oldest exchanges, located in London. LSE

### Commodity Exchanges

These exchanges facilitate trading in physical commodities like gold, oil, and agricultural products. Examples include:

- **Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)**: Offers trading in a vast array of commodities and financial instruments. CME
- **Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)**: Operates global [commodity](../c/commodity.md) and financial product exchanges. ICE

### Derivative Exchanges

These are platforms specifically for trading [futures](../f/futures.md), [options](../o/options.md), and other [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contracts. Examples include:

- **Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) Exchange (CBOE)**: Known for [options](../o/options.md) trading on various financial instruments. CBOE
- **Eurex**: A major European [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) exchange. Eurex

### Cryptocurrency Exchanges

Exchanges dedicated to the trading of digital and cryptocurrencies. Examples include:

- **[Binance](../b/binance.md)**: One of the largest global cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance
- **[Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md)**: A popular exchange in the United States. Coinbase

## Functions of Exchanges

### Price Discovery

Exchanges play a pivotal role in the [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) process by aggregating buy and sell orders, thereby determining the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of securities or commodities.

### Liquidity

By providing a platform where a large number of participants can [trade](../t/trade.md), exchanges ensure that there is enough [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [market](../m/market.md), making it easier to buy and sell.

### Transparency

Exchanges [offer](../o/offer.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) by disseminating real-time information about trading volumes, prices, and other critical data, enabling investors to make informed decisions.

### Regulation

Most exchanges operate under stringent regulatory frameworks to ensure fair trading practices and to protect investors. For example, in the United States, the Securities and Exchange [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) regulates stock exchanges.

## Electronic vs. Physical Exchanges

### Electronic Exchanges

Electronic exchanges operate through digital platforms where matching buy and sell orders occur automatically without human intervention. Examples include [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) and many cryptocurrency exchanges.

### Physical Exchanges

Physical exchanges have trading floors where traders buy and sell securities in person, although most have also adopted electronic [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md). NYSE is a prime example.

## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETFs are investment funds traded on exchanges, much like [stocks](../s/stock.md). They [hold](../h/hold.md) assets such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, or bonds and generally aim to track an [index](../i/index_instrument.md). Popular ETF providers include:

- **BlackRock’s [iShares](../i/ishares.md)**: Offers a variety of ETF [options](../o/options.md). iShares
- **Vanguard**: Known for its low-cost ETFs. Vanguard

## High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency trading involves executing a large number of orders at extremely high speeds using sophisticated algorithms. It relies heavily on advanced technology and low-latency systems to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on small price discrepancies. Prominent HFT firms include:

- **Virtu Financial**: A leading player in the HFT space. Virtu
- **Citadel Securities**: Offers both [market](../m/market.md) making and HFT services. Citadel Securities

## Clearing and Settlement

### Clearing

[Clearing](../c/clearing.md) is the process of confirming and matching buy and sell orders. Clearinghouses act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers to ensure the smooth completion of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

### Settlement

Settlement is the actual transfer of the securities from the seller to the buyer and the corresponding transfer of funds. This process usually takes two [business](../b/business.md) days after the [trade](../t/trade.md) date (T+2), but some markets and securities may have different settlement periods.

## Global Reach

Exchanges are not confined to one geography and often have a global reach. For instance:

- **Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX)**: One of the largest in Asia. HKEX
- **Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)**: Japan's premier securities exchange. TSE

In summary, exchanges are critical institutions in the financial world, providing a structured and regulated environment for the trading of various financial instruments. They support key [market](../m/market.md) functions such as [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md), [liquidity provision](../l/liquidity_provision.md), and [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and are fundamental to the operation and stability of global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
