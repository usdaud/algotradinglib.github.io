# Edge AI

Edge AI refers to the deployment of [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) algorithms on devices at the “edge” of the network (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices), rather than relying solely on cloud-based processing.

### Key Components
- **On-Device Processing:** Running AI models locally on devices.
- **Low-Latency Inference:** Fast decision-making without network delays.
- **Resource Constraints:** Models must be optimized for limited computational power and memory.
- **Energy [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md):** Critical for battery-powered devices.

### Applications
- **Smartphones and Wearables:** Voice assistants, image recognition, and health monitoring.
- **IoT Devices:** Real-time analytics for industrial sensors and smart [home](../h/home.md) devices.
- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Onboard processing for navigation and safety.
- **[Security](../s/security.md) Systems:** Local video analytics for surveillance and threat detection.

### Advantages
- Reduced latency and faster response times.
- Enhanced privacy, as data does not need to be transmitted to the cloud.
- Lower dependency on network connectivity.

### Challenges
- Limited computational resources require highly optimized models.
- Balancing model complexity with energy consumption.
- Frequent updates and [security](../s/security.md) patches are necessary for on-device systems.

### Future Outlook
Edge AI is expected to grow as devices become more powerful and energy-efficient. Innovations in model compression and on-device [optimization](../o/optimization.md) [will](../w/will.md) further enable advanced AI capabilities outside traditional data centers.
