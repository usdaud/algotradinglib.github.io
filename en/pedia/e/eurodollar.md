# Eurodollar

Eurodollars are a type of [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that refers to U.S. dollars deposited in banks outside the United States. These can be either foreign banks or foreign branches of American banks. Eurodollars are widely used in the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) and play a significant role in international [finance](../f/finance.md) and banking. They are often used for lending, investments, and hedging financial risks.

## Origins and Definition

### Historical Background

The term "Eurodollar" dates back to the 1950s and 1960s when large amounts of U.S. dollars were held in European banks. The Cold War increased geopolitical uncertainties, leading to the need for U.S. dollars outside the U.S. for [trade](../t/trade.md) and financial transactions. Soviet banks, for example, held substantial dollar deposits in European banks to avoid potential freezes by U.S. authorities.

### Definitions and Characteristics

1. **Deposits**: Eurodollar deposits are simply dollar-denominated deposits at banks outside the United States. These deposits [offer](../o/offer.md) the same [value](../v/value.md) as U.S. dollars within the United States.
2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Eurodollar [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are now primarily determined by SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) in June 2023. SOFR is the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate that reflects the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.
3. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) and Regulation**: Eurodollar markets operate outside the regulatory [scope](../s/scope.md) of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, giving them a unique status in the global financial landscape.

## Eurodollar Deposits and Loans

### Deposits

Eurodollar deposits are typically large, often millions of dollars, and are used primarily by corporations, financial institutions, and governments to manage their dollar reserves outside the United States.

#### Characteristics of Eurodollar Deposits:

1. **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**: Eurodollar deposits can have varying maturities, from one day (overnight) to several years.
2. **Transferability**: These deposits are highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) and can be transferred between accounts relatively easily.
3. **[Yield](../y/yield.md)**: The [yield](../y/yield.md) on Eurodollar deposits is often higher than that on equivalent U.S. deposits, primarily because they don't fall under U.S. [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md).

### Loans

Eurodollar loans are loans made in U.S. dollars by banks outside the United States. These loans are used by borrowers to avoid the complexities of [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) fluctuations.

#### Characteristics of Eurodollar Loans:

1. **Flexibility**: Eurodollar loans [offer](../o/offer.md) greater flexibility in terms of [maturity](../m/maturity.md) and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedules than domestic loans.
2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: The [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on these loans are generally tied to SOFR (which replaced LIBOR in June 2023), making them competitive and attractive for large-scale borrowers.

## Eurodollar Futures and Options

Eurodollar [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) are [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments that allow traders to speculate on or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against changes in U.S. [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. These contracts are standardized and traded on organized exchanges, the most prominent being the Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CME).

### Eurodollar Futures

Eurodollar [futures](../f/futures.md) are contracts that represent a hypothetical [deposit](../d/deposit.md) of $1 million with a three-month [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

#### Characteristics of Eurodollar Futures:

1. **Standardization**: These contracts have standardized terms, making them highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md).
2. **Hedging**: They are primarily used for hedging [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) risks, especially by large financial institutions.
3. **[Speculation](../s/speculation.md)**: They are also popular among traders and speculators looking to [profit](../p/profit.md) from [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements.

### Eurodollar Options

Eurodollar [options](../o/options.md) give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a Eurodollar [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) at a specified price and time.

#### Characteristics of Eurodollar Options:

1. **Flexibility**: These [options](../o/options.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) more strategic flexibility as they allow traders to benefit from a variety of [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
2. **Hedging**: Like [futures](../f/futures.md), they are also used for hedging, providing a more nuanced tool to manage [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) risks.

## Eurodollar Markets

The Eurodollar [market](../m/market.md) is a vast, decentralized international [money market](../m/money_market.md) that deals in Eurodollar deposits and loans. Major financial centers include London, Paris, and Singapore, among others.

### Importance of Eurodollar Markets

2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: They play a critical role in determining global [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, as Eurodollar rates often serve as benchmarks.
3. **[Currency Hedging](../c/currency_hedging.md)**: They [offer](../o/offer.md) platforms for hedging [currency](../c/currency.md) risks without involving [multiple](../m/multiple.md) currencies.
