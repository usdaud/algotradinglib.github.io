# Ether (ETH)

Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), a decentralized, [open](../o/open.md)-source [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) system that features smart contract functionality. First proposed in late 2013 by programmer [Vitalik Buterin](../v/vitalik_buterin.md) and development subsequently crowdfunded in 2014, [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) was launched on July 30, 2015. ETH, like other cryptocurrencies, leverages the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority.

# How It Works

## Blockchain Technology

Ether operates on the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), which is a [distributed ledger technology](../d/distributed_ledger_technology.md) that records all transactions made with ETH. The [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) ensures [security](../s/security.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) by disseminating the ledger across a decentralized network of computers (nodes). These nodes validate and record all transactions on the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md).

## Smart Contracts

One of [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md)’s most innovative features is its [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md). A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms directly written into code. This code and the agreements contained within it exist on the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). They automatically enforce and execute the terms of the contract when certain predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.

## Gas Fees

The [execution](../e/execution.md) of transactions and [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) on [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) requires computational power, which is where gas fees come in. Gas is a unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations, like transactions or smart contract operations. Users must pay ETH to cover these costs, ensuring that the network remains functional and secure.

## Proof of Stake

Originally, [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) used a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism similar to [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)’s, in which miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. However, [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) is transitioning to Proof of Stake (PoS) with [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) 2.0. In PoS, validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of ETH they [hold](../h/hold.md) and are willing to "stake" as [collateral](../c/collateral.md). This transition aims to make the network more scalable, energy-efficient, and secure.

# Ether vs. Bitcoin

Ether and [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) serve as the two most prominent cryptocurrencies, but they have several key differences.

## Purpose and Use Cases

- **[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md):** Often referred to as "digital gold," [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) was created to be a decentralized [digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md) that allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries.

- **Ether:** While Ether also facilitates peer-to-peer transactions, its primary purpose is to incentivize and power the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) network, supporting its development and [execution](../e/execution.md) of decentralized apps (dApps) and [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md).

## Technology

- **[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md):** Utilizes a PoW consensus mechanism and has a capped [supply](../s/supply.md) of 21 million BTC.

- **Ether:** Originally used PoW but is shifting to PoS. It doesn’t have a capped [supply](../s/supply.md), although [inflation](../i/inflation.md) is controlled through periodic updates and changes to the network protocol.

## Speed and Efficiency

- **[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md):** [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) transactions can be slower and more costly, owing to the PoW system and block size.

- **Ether:** Transactions and smart contract executions on [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) tend to be faster, especially with the integration of layer 2 solutions and the upcoming [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) 2.0 upgrades.

## Scalability

- **[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md):** Limited in [scalability](../s/scalability.md) due to its block size and PoW mechanism.

- **Ether:** Designed to be more scalable with upcoming [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) 2.0 upgrades, including sharding and PoS, which aim to increase [transaction](../t/transaction.md) [throughput](../t/throughput.md) and reduce costs.

## Community and Development

- **[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md):** Primarily supported by a community focused on maintaining it as a secure, decentralized form of digital gold.

- **Ether:** Supported by a more diverse community, including developers working on dApps, DeFi projects, and other smart contract-based innovations.

# Major Projects and Ecosystem

Ether powers a broad ecosystem of dApps and DeFi projects. Some of the most notable projects include:

- **Uniswap:** A decentralized [exchange](../e/exchange.md) that allows users to [trade](../t/trade.md) ETH and ERC-20 tokens without intermediaries.

- **MakerDAO:** A decentralized [finance](../f/finance.md) platform that enables users to borrow and lend ETH and other tokens.

- **OpenSea:** A marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unique digital assets that exist on the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md).

These projects, among countless others, underscore the versatile applications of Ether within the rapidly growing [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) ecosystem.

# Conclusion

Ether (ETH) is much more than a [digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md); it is the lifeblood of a dynamic and rapidly evolving ecosystem that fosters innovation in decentralized applications and [finance](../f/finance.md). Its features, such as [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) and the upcoming shift to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, differentiate it from [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and position it as a cornerstone of the decentralized web.
