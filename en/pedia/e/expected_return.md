# Expected Return

In the realm of [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md), specifically [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (or "algo trading"), the concept of Expected [Return](../r/return.md) is fundamental. Expected [Return](../r/return.md) refers to the mean of the [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md) of possible returns of an [asset](../a/asset.md), investment, or portfolio. It is a critical metric in evaluating the potential profitability of trades and investments in both traditional and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).

## What is Expected Return?

Expected [Return](../r/return.md) (\(E(R)\)) represents the [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) of all possible returns from an investment, where the weights correspond to the probabilities of each outcome occurring. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[ E(R) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i \cdot R_i \]

where:
- \(E(R)\) is the Expected [Return](../r/return.md),
- \(P_i\) is the probability of the \(i\)-th [return](../r/return.md),
- \(R_i\) is the \(i\)-th potential [return](../r/return.md),
- \(n\) is the number of potential returns.

## Importance of Expected Return in Algo Trading

### Risk Assessment and Management

Expected [Return](../r/return.md) is a crucial [factor](../f/factor.md) in quantifying the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with different [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). By understanding the potential for gains and losses, traders can adjust their algorithms to optimize performance and minimize [risk](../r/risk.md). Coupled with other metrics such as variance and [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md), Expected [Return](../r/return.md) helps in the calculation of [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns, which is essential for making informed investment decisions.

### Portfolio Optimization

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md) aims to create a combination of assets that maximizes the Expected [Return](../r/return.md) for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md). This is often achieved using statistical techniques such as [Mean-Variance Optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md), where Expected [Return](../r/return.md) plays a significant role in determining the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md)â€”the set of optimal portfolios that provide the highest Expected [Return](../r/return.md) for a defined level of [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Performance Metrics

Many [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) in algo trading, such as the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), rely on Expected [Return](../r/return.md). The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), which measures the performance of an investment compared to a [risk-free asset](../r/risk-free_asset.md) after adjusting for [risk](../r/risk.md), is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{E(R) - R_f}{\sigma} \]

where:
- \(E(R)\) is the Expected [Return](../r/return.md),
- \(R_f\) is the [risk-free rate of return](../r/risk-free_rate_of_return.md),
- \(\sigma\) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the [return](../r/return.md).

A higher [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) indicates a more attractive [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md), thereby reinforcing the importance of accurately calculating Expected [Return](../r/return.md).

## Calculating Expected Return

### Historical Mean Return

One of the simplest methods to estimate Expected [Return](../r/return.md) is to calculate the historical mean [return](../r/return.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) or a portfolio. This involves computing the [average return](../a/average_return.md) over a specified historical period:

\[ E(R) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i \]

Here, \(n\) is the number of historical periods (e.g., days, months, years), and \(R_i\) is the [return](../r/return.md) in the \(i\)-th period.

### Probability Distribution

For investments with discrete outcomes, Expected [Return](../r/return.md) can be calculated by assigning probabilities to different potential returns. For example, consider an investment with the following potential outcomes and associated probabilities:

- [Return](../r/return.md) 10% with probability 0.3,
- [Return](../r/return.md) 5% with probability 0.5,
- [Return](../r/return.md) -2% with probability 0.2.

The Expected [Return](../r/return.md) would be:

\[ E(R) = (0.3 \cdot 10\%) + (0.5 \cdot 5\%) + (0.2 \cdot (-2\%)) = 4.3\% \]

### Dividend Discount Model

For [stocks](../s/stock.md), the [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Discount](../d/discount.md) Model (DDM) can be used to estimate Expected [Return](../r/return.md), especially if the stock pays dividends. The DDM calculates the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of expected future dividends:

\[ E(R) = \frac{D_1}{P_0} + g \]

where:
- \(D_1\) is the expected [dividend](../d/dividend.md) in the next period,
- \(P_0\) is the current stock price,
- \(g\) is the growth rate of dividends.

### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The CAPM is another widely used model to estimate Expected [Return](../r/return.md), particularly in the context of diversified portfolios. It describes the relationship between [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md) and Expected [Return](../r/return.md):

\[ E(R) = R_f + \[beta](../b/beta.md)(E(R_m) - R_f) \]

where:
- \(R_f\) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate,
- \(\[beta](../b/beta.md)\) is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the investment (a measure of its [volatility](../v/volatility.md) relative to the [market](../m/market.md)),
- \(E(R_m)\) is the expected [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md).

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

### Backtesting

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) is a crucial phase in the development of any [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) strategy. It involves testing the strategy on historical data to assess its potential performance. Expected [Return](../r/return.md) is used extensively in [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) to measure the strategy's profitability and [risk](../r/risk.md) characteristics over the tested period.

### Real-Time Decision Making

In real-time trading, algorithms must make quick decisions based on the latest [market](../m/market.md) data. Calculating the Expected [Return](../r/return.md) on potential trades allows these algorithms to prioritize trades that [offer](../o/offer.md) the best [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns. This real-time analysis is vital for maintaining the trading edge provided by algorithmic strategies.

### Machine Learning and AI

[Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) (ML) and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) (AI) techniques are increasingly being employed in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) to predict [asset](../a/asset.md) prices and develop [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Expected [Return](../r/return.md) is often a target variable in [supervised learning](../s/supervised_learning.md) models, where the algorithms are trained to predict future returns based on historical data and various explanatory features.

### Risk Metrics and Adjustments

[Algorithmic trading platforms](../a/algorithmic_trading_platforms.md) often use Expected [Return](../r/return.md) along with other [risk metrics](../r/risk_metrics.md) to dynamically adjust trading positions. These adjustments ensure that the overall [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure of the portfolio remains within the desired limits. For example, algorithms might reduce exposure to high-[risk](../r/risk.md) assets during periods of increased [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to protect the portfolio.
