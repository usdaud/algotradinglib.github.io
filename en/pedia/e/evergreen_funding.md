# Evergreen Funding

Evergreen funding is a financial strategy predominantly used by businesses, especially startups and investment funds, where investments and [capital](../c/capital.md) are continuously provided as needed rather than in a lump sum. This method ensures that companies have the necessary resources to operate and grow without the need to go through [multiple](../m/multiple.md) rounds of traditional funding methods. This continuous infusion of [capital](../c/capital.md) maintains operational stability and promotes sustainable long-term growth.

## Concept Overview

Evergreen funding is characterized by its ongoing contribution structure. Instead of receiving large investments during specific funding rounds, businesses are allocated funds on a continuous [basis](../b/basis.md). This may be structured on a timeline (monthly, quarterly) or as needs arise.

### Core Principles

1. **Continuity**: Funding is not limited to one-time large investments. Businesses receive financial support over extended periods.
2. **Flexibility**: Investment terms can be adjusted based on the [business](../b/business.md) needs and [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).
3. **Sustainability**: Provides a sustainable financial foundation, reducing the pressure of having to secure large sums in uncertain [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Advantages of Evergreen Funding

1. **Reduced Pressure**: Startups and smaller firms are under less pressure to perform exceptionally within short periods as funds are provided as needed.
2. **Steady Growth**: Promotes a more sustainable and steady growth trajectory rather than short-term aggressive growth.
3. **Conflict Reduction**: Minimizes potential conflicts with investors over the management’s focus and strategic decisions as the need to please investors for future rounds diminishes.
4. **Resource Allocation**: More effective and efficient resource allocation as funds can be tailored to current needs.
5. **[Market](../m/market.md) Adaptability**: Companies can better adapt to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions with continuous funding rather than being constrained by the timelines of traditional funding rounds.

## Potential Challenges

1. **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Continuous funding might lead to ownership [dilution](../d/dilution.md) if the company issues new [shares](../s/shares.md) repeatedly to [gain](../g/gain.md) this funding.
2. **Complacency**: The steady flow of funds might lead to complacency in the management team, reducing the drive to innovate or efficiently manage resources.
3. **[company filings](../i/investor_relations.md)**: Ongoing funding requires maintaining strong, trusting relationships with investors who are prepared to commit continuously, which might be challenging.
4. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: Traditional funding rounds involve [valuation](../v/valuation.md) events; with evergreen funding, fewer such events occur, which might create uncertainties about the company's current [market](../m/market.md) [valuation](../v/valuation.md).
