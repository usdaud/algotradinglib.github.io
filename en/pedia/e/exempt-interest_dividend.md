# Exempt-Interest Dividend

An exempt-[interest](../i/interest.md) [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is a type of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) available to shareholders of certain regulated investment companies, specifically mutual funds registered under the [Investment Company Act of 1940](../i/investment_company_act_of_1940.md) that meet specific requirements. These dividends are typically generated from [income](../i/income.md) earned on [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), which are issued by local, county, or state government entities. The primary advantage of exempt-[interest](../i/interest.md) dividends is that they are exempt from [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax and may also be exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md) if the [investor](../i/investor.md) resides in the same state in which the bonds were issued.

## Understanding Exempt-Interest Dividends

Exempt-[interest](../i/interest.md) dividends are particularly attractive to investors in higher [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md), as they allow the [investor](../i/investor.md) to receive [income](../i/income.md) without the corresponding tax burden. This can make investments in [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) funds especially appealing compared to taxable [bond](../b/bond.md) investments. For example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) who would otherwise pay a high [marginal tax rate](../m/marginal_tax_rate.md) on [bond](../b/bond.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) might opt for a [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) that pays exempt-[interest](../i/interest.md) dividends to reduce their overall [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).

### Eligibility Criteria for Exempt-Interest Dividends

1. **Regulated [Investment Company](../i/investment_company.md)**: The [fund](../f/fund.md) must qualify as a regulated [investment company](../i/investment_company.md) (RIC) under the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code.
2. **Municipal Securities Portfolio**: The funds are required to invest predominantly in municipal securities.
3. **Distributable [Earnings](../e/earnings.md)**: The source of the [income](../i/income.md) passed to shareholders in the form of dividends should be from the [interest](../i/interest.md) on the [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md).

### How Exempt-Interest Dividends Work

Mutual funds that are designed to pay out exempt-[interest](../i/interest.md) dividends, such as [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) funds, pool [money](../m/money.md) from a large number of investors and use that [money](../m/money.md) to purchase a variety of municipal securities. The [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) generated from these securities is received by the [fund](../f/fund.md), which then distributes this [income](../i/income.md) to shareholders as dividends. The [exemption](../e/exemption.md) comes into play as these dividends are composed of [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) from [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), which is not subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax.

### Tax Treatment of Exempt-Interest Dividends

1. **Federal [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: Exempt-[interest](../i/interest.md) dividends are not included in an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) for [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax purposes.
2. **State and Local [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: Depending on the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s state of residence and wherein the municipal securities are issued, these dividends might also be exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). However, this can vary widely by state and specific tax regulations.
3. **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)**: Some [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), specifically private-activity bonds, can be subject to the AMT. Exempt-[interest](../i/interest.md) dividends derived from such bonds might partially or fully be subject to AMT.

### Reporting and Documentation

Investors [will](../w/will.md) typically receive a [Form 1099-DIV](../f/form_1099-div.md) from the [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) detailing the amount of exempt-[interest](../i/interest.md) dividends along with any other distributions they may have received. This form is essential for completing an accurate [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) and ensuring that any exempt dividends are properly excluded from [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

## Benefits of Exempt-Interest Dividends

1. **Tax [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Exempt-[interest](../i/interest.md) dividends provide a significant tax advantage by reducing an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
2. **Predictable [Income](../i/income.md)**: For those seeking regular and predictable [income](../i/income.md), [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) funds can provide frequent dividends.
3. **Government-Backed Securities**: Generally, municipal securities are considered relatively safe investments as they are supported by local, county, or state tax revenues.

## Risks Associated with Exempt-Interest Dividends

1. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [value](../v/value.md) of the bonds in the [fund](../f/fund.md) may decline, affecting the overall performance.
2. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: Despite their governmental backing, [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) are subject to [credit](../c/credit.md) risks, especially if the issuing municipality faces financial difficulties.
3. **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**: Like all securities, [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) funds can be subject to [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations.

## Concluding Thoughts

Exempt-[interest](../i/interest.md) dividends present an attractive opportunity for investors looking to minimize their tax liabilities while earning [income](../i/income.md). These dividends, primarily stemming from investments in [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), [offer](../o/offer.md) a significant tax advantage at the federal level and potentially at the state and local levels, making them a compelling choice for high-net-worth individuals and those in higher [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md). However, like any investment, they come with their own set of risks that should be carefully considered within the context of an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s broader financial goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).
