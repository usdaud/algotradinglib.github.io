# Exercise Price

In the realm of [options](../o/options.md) trading, the term "[exercise](../e/exercise.md) price" stands as one of the most fundamental concepts. Also known as the "[strike price](../s/strike_price.md)," it is the predefined price at which the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) of an option can be bought or sold when the option is exercised. Understanding the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price is crucial for traders and investors who engage in [options](../o/options.md) trading because it directly influences the profitability and decision-making process.

## What is Exercise Price?

The [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price is the fixed price at which the holder of an [options contract](../o/options_contract.md) can purchase (in the case of a [call option](../c/call_option.md)) or sell (in the case of a [put option](../p/put.md)) the [underlying security](../u/underlying_security.md). This price is pre-determined at the time the option contract is written and remains constant throughout the life of the option.

In simpler terms, if you [hold](../h/hold.md) an option, the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price is the amount you would pay (or receive) to buy (or sell) the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) if you choose to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the option. This price is a critical determinant in the potential profitability of the option and plays a significant role in the decision of whether or not to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) it.

## Put and Call Options

### Call Options

A [call option](../c/call_option.md) gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price before or at the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). If the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) is above the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price, the [call option](../c/call_option.md) is said to be "in the [money](../m/money.md)" because exercising it would allow purchasing the [asset](../a/asset.md) at a lower than [market price](../m/market_price.md), thereby yielding a [profit](../p/profit.md).

#### Example of a Call Option

Assume you have a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with an [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price of $50 for a stock currently trading at $60. If you [exercise](../e/exercise.md) your option, you can buy the stock at $50, even though its [market price](../m/market_price.md) is $60, thus giving you an immediate [profit](../p/profit.md) of $10 per share (excluding any premiums paid for the option itself).

### Put Options

A [put option](../p/put.md) gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price before or at the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). If the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) is below the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price, the [put option](../p/put.md) is said to be "in the [money](../m/money.md)," because exercising it would allow selling the [asset](../a/asset.md) at a higher than [market price](../m/market_price.md), thereby yielding a [profit](../p/profit.md).

#### Example of a Put Option

Assume you have a [put option](../p/put.md) with an [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price of $50 for a stock currently trading at $40. If you [exercise](../e/exercise.md) your option, you can sell the stock at $50, even though its [market price](../m/market_price.md) is $40, thus giving you an immediate [profit](../p/profit.md) of $10 per share (excluding any premiums paid for the option itself).

## In the Money, Out of the Money, and At the Money

Understanding the terms "in the [money](../m/money.md)," "out of the [money](../m/money.md)," and "[at the money](../a/at_the_money.md)" is essential for evaluating [options](../o/options.md).

### In the Money (ITM)

- **Call [Options](../o/options.md):** A [call option](../c/call_option.md) is considered "in the [money](../m/money.md)" when the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is higher than the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price. This indicates that exercising the option would result in a [profit](../p/profit.md).

 Example: If the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price is $50 and the [asset](../a/asset.md) is trading at $60, the [call option](../c/call_option.md) is $10 in the [money](../m/money.md).

- **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md):** A [put option](../p/put.md) is considered "in the [money](../m/money.md)" when the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is lower than the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price. This indicates that exercising the option would result in a [profit](../p/profit.md).

 Example: If the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price is $50 and the [asset](../a/asset.md) is trading at $40, the [put option](../p/put.md) is $10 in the [money](../m/money.md).

### Out of the Money (OTM)

- **Call [Options](../o/options.md):** A [call option](../c/call_option.md) is "out of the [money](../m/money.md)" when the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is below the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price. Exercising the option would not be profitable.

 Example: If the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price is $50 and the [asset](../a/asset.md) is trading at $40, the [call option](../c/call_option.md) is out of the [money](../m/money.md).

- **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md):** A [put option](../p/put.md) is "out of the [money](../m/money.md)" when the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is above the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price. Exercising the option would not be profitable.

 Example: If the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price is $50 and the [asset](../a/asset.md) is trading at $60, the [put option](../p/put.md) is out of the [money](../m/money.md).

### At the Money (ATM)

- **Call and [Put Options](../p/put_options.md):** An option (whether call or put) is "[at the money](../a/at_the_money.md)" when the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is equal to the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price. Neither a [profit](../p/profit.md) nor a loss would be realized if the option is exercised.

 Example: If the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price is $50 and the [asset](../a/asset.md) is trading at $50, the option is [at the money](../a/at_the_money.md).

## Real-World Application

The concept of the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price and the terms ITM, OTM, and ATM are not just theoretical but are actively used by traders and financial analysts to make informed decisions. A [trader](../t/trader.md) must weigh the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price, along with other factors such as premiums, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and expiration dates, to decide whether to enter, [hold](../h/hold.md), or exit an [options](../o/options.md) position.

## Financial Institutions and Exercise Price

Several financial companies and services focus on [options](../o/options.md) trading and provide platforms for traders to manage their [options](../o/options.md) portfolio effectively. For instance:

- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md)** ( A comprehensive [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) [offering](../o/offering.md) a [range](../r/range.md) of financial instruments, including [options](../o/options.md).

- **[E*TRADE](../e/e_trade.md)** ( Provides a [robust](../r/robust.md) [options](../o/options.md) trading interface along with educational resources for new traders.

- **TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md)** ( Known for its powerful thinkorswim [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) designed for [options](../o/options.md) traders.

## Conclusion

Understanding the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) price and its implications is vital for anyone involved in [options](../o/options.md) trading. Whether you are a seasoned [trader](../t/trader.md) or a novice [investor](../i/investor.md), knowing when an option is in the [money](../m/money.md), out of the [money](../m/money.md), or [at the money](../a/at_the_money.md) can decisively impact your [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) and profitability. [Options](../o/options.md) trading adds complexity to [investing](../i/investing.md) but also offers the potential for significant rewards if understood and executed properly.
