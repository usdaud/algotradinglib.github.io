# Electronic Trading

Electronic trading is the execution of trades through electronic systems rather than open outcry. It has become the dominant mode of trading across most asset classes.

## Key Features
- Automated order matching
- Faster execution and lower latency
- Increased transparency through electronic order books

## Market Impact
Electronic trading has tightened spreads in many markets and enabled high frequency strategies. It has also increased competition and reduced manual intervention.

## Trading Considerations
Algorithmic execution, order routing, and data quality become critical. Latency and infrastructure can materially affect outcomes for active strategies.

## Risks
System outages, connectivity failures, and algorithm errors can cause significant losses. Robust monitoring and risk controls are essential.

## Practical Notes
Traders should understand venue microstructure, order types, and the behavior of electronic auctions to optimize execution.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
