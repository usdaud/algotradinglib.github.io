# Exercise Price

The exercise price, also called the strike price, is the price at which an option holder can buy or sell the underlying asset.

## Role in Options Trading
- Determines the intrinsic value of an option
- Defines the payoff structure at expiration
- Used to construct spreads and hedges

## Moneyness
- In the money: option has intrinsic value
- At the money: price near the strike
- Out of the money: option has no intrinsic value

## Practical Notes
Strike selection affects risk, reward, and sensitivity to volatility. Wider strikes reduce premium but lower the probability of finishing in the money.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
