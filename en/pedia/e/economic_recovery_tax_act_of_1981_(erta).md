# Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA)

The [Economic Recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA), also known as the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut, is a significant piece of legislation in the history of U.S. economic policy. Introduced during the first year of President Ronald Reagan's administration, ERTA marked a dramatic shift in American [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md) by prioritizing tax reductions to stimulate [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). The act aimed to counteract the economic challenges of the late 1970s and early 1980s, including [stagflation](../s/stagflation.md), high [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), and sluggish growth.

## Overview of ERTA

The [Economic Recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) Tax Act of 1981 was signed into law on August 13, 1981. Its primary components included massive cuts in [personal income](../p/personal_income.md) tax rates, incentives for businesses through investment tax credits, and adjustments to [estate](../e/estate.md) and gift [taxes](../t/taxes.md). The legislation marked a transition toward [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md), which hinges on the idea that lowering [taxes](../t/taxes.md) [will](../w/will.md) spur investment, boost production, and lead to economic [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

### Key Provisions of ERTA

1. **Reduction in Individual [Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md) Rates**: One of the most notable aspects of ERTA was the reduction in marginal tax rates for individuals. The top [marginal tax rate](../m/marginal_tax_rate.md) was cut from 70% to 50%, and across-the-board reductions were implemented for all taxpayers.

2. **[Indexing](../i/indexing.md) of [Tax Brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md)**: To combat the effects of [inflation](../i/inflation.md), ERTA introduced the [indexing](../i/indexing.md) of [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md) to prevent "bracket creep," where [inflation](../i/inflation.md) pushes taxpayers into higher [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md) without an actual increase in [real income](../r/real_income.md).

3. **Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS)**: ERTA introduced ACRS, which allowed businesses to recover the costs of [capital](../c/capital.md) investments more quickly through [accelerated depreciation](../a/accelerated_depreciation.md) deductions. This [provision](../p/provision.md) aimed to boost investment in machinery, equipment, and other [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures.

4. **Reduction in [Capital Gains Tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) Rate**: The act reduced the maximum long-term [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) rate from 28% to 20%, with the intention of encouraging investment in [stocks](../s/stock.md), [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and other assets.

5. **[Estate](../e/estate.md) and [Gift Tax](../g/gift_tax.md) Reductions**: ERTA increased the unified [estate](../e/estate.md) and [gift tax](../g/gift_tax.md) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) from $175,000 to $600,000 over six years, and introduced a new [unlimited marital deduction](../u/unlimited_marital_deduction.md), allowing for [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) transfers between spouses.

6. **Investment [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (ITC)**: The act reinstated the investment [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md), providing businesses with a [credit](../c/credit.md) against their [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) for investments in certain property and equipment. The ITC aimed to spur investment in productive assets.

7. **IRA Contributions**: ERTA expanded the rules for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), allowing more taxpayers to contribute and deduct these contributions from their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). This [provision](../p/provision.md) was designed to encourage long-term savings and [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md).

## Economic Rationale Behind ERTA

The [Economic Recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) Tax Act of 1981 was rooted in [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md), a theory popularized by economists like Arthur Laffer. Proponents of [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md) argue that lower tax rates increase the incentive for individuals and businesses to work, save, invest, and engage in entrepreneurial activities. The increased economic activity, in turn, was expected to lead to higher tax revenues, despite the lower rates.

### The Laffer Curve

One of the central concepts influencing ERTA was the [Laffer Curve](../l/laffer_curve.md), which posits that there is an optimal [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) that maximizes government [revenue](../r/revenue.md). According to the curve, both excessively high and excessively low tax rates can lead to reduced [revenue](../r/revenue.md). The theory suggests that reducing high marginal tax rates can boost economic activity so significantly that tax revenues might actually increase due to expanded [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

### Criticisms of Supply-Side Economics

Despite its appeal, [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md) and ERTA were subject to criticism. Detractors argued that the tax cuts disproportionately benefited the wealthy and led to increased [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md). Additionally, critics contended that the anticipated [revenue](../r/revenue.md) increases often failed to materialize, exacerbating [budget](../b/budget.md) deficits and contributing to a burgeoning national [debt](../d/debt.md).

## Impact and Legacy of ERTA

The immediate impact of the [Economic Recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) Tax Act of 1981 was substantial. The act significantly altered the fiscal landscape of the United States, affecting both economic policy and the broader [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Economic Growth and Business Investment

In the years following the passage of ERTA, the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md) experienced notable growth. The reduction in tax rates, coupled with other reforms, appeared to stimulate economic activity. [Business](../b/business.md) investment, in particular, saw a boost due to the investment [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) and [accelerated depreciation](../a/accelerated_depreciation.md) provisions.

### Budget Deficits and National Debt

One of the most controversial outcomes of ERTA was its impact on the federal [budget](../b/budget.md). The tax cuts contributed to significant [budget](../b/budget.md) deficits in the 1980s. The combination of reduced [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and increased government spending led to a sharp rise in the national [debt](../d/debt.md). This outcome fueled an ongoing debate about the efficacy and sustainability of [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md).

### Influence on Subsequent Tax Policy

The principles and policies [underlying](../u/underlying.md) ERTA had a lasting influence on subsequent tax legislation in the United States. The focus on reducing marginal tax rates and stimulating [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) through tax policy continued to shape fiscal debates and reforms in the following decades. Subsequent tax acts, such as the [Tax Reform Act of 1986](../t/tax_reform_act_of_1986.md), built on and modified the changes introduced by ERTA.

## Conclusion

The [Economic Recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) Tax Act of 1981 was a landmark piece of legislation that marked a significant shift in U.S. economic policy. By prioritizing tax reductions and [supply](../s/supply.md)-side principles, ERTA aimed to spur [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and investment. While the act succeeded in boosting economic activity in the short term, it also contributed to [budget](../b/budget.md) deficits and rising national [debt](../d/debt.md), sparking ongoing debates about the merits and drawbacks of [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md). The legacy of ERTA continues to be felt in contemporary discussions about [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md) and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).
