# Earnings Gap

An earnings gap is a price gap that occurs when a company reports earnings and the market reprices the stock at the open. The gap reflects the difference between expectations and the reported results or guidance.

## Why It Happens
Earnings releases arrive outside regular trading hours, so the first regular session price can jump to a new level. The size and direction of the gap often reflect surprises in revenue, margins, or forward guidance.

## Trading Implications
Earnings gaps can create strong momentum but also high volatility. Some traders seek continuation in the gap direction, while others look for partial gap fills if the move appears overextended.

## Factors That Influence Gap Size
- Magnitude of earnings surprise
- Changes in guidance or outlook
- Broader market sentiment and risk appetite
- Liquidity and premarket order flow

## Risks
Gaps can reverse quickly as initial reactions fade. Liquidity is often thin at the open, which increases slippage. Risk controls and position sizing are critical.

## Practical Notes
Define a clear plan before the release. Post earnings volatility can remain elevated for several sessions, so options pricing and stop placement should reflect wider ranges.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
