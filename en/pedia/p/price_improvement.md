# Price Improvement

Price improvement occurs when an order is executed at a better price than the displayed quote. It benefits the trader by reducing transaction cost.

## How it happens
- Hidden liquidity at a better price.
- Price improvement programs at brokers.
- Internalization by market makers who offer a slight price edge.

## Example
A trader submits a market buy when the best ask is 50.05. The order executes at 50.03, giving price improvement.

## Practical notes
Price improvement is more likely in liquid stocks with tight spreads. Some brokers report price improvement statistics to clients.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Price Improvement and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Price Improvement as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Price Improvement, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Price Improvement. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Price Improvement alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
