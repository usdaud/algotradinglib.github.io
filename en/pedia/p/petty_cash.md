# Petty Cash

## Introduction

Petty cash is a small amount of discretionary funds in the form of cash that is used for expenditures where it is not practical to make disbursements by [check](../c/check.md). The term "petty" signifies that these are funds that are relatively minor but necessary for the smooth functioning of day-to-day [business](../b/business.md) operations.

## Definition of Petty Cash

Petty cash is generally a small amount of [money](../m/money.md) kept on hand for minor [business](../b/business.md) expenses. These expenses could include payments for postage, office supplies, or other small, often unforeseen expenses that crop up during the day.

## Purpose and Importance

The purpose of having petty cash is to avoid the paperwork involved in writing checks for transactions involving small amounts and to provide immediate accessibility to funds for minor purchases. The proper management of petty cash ensures accurate financial records and accountability within the organization.

## Usage of Petty Cash

### Common Expenses

- **Office supplies:** Such as pens, notepads, or toners that run out unexpectedly.
- **Postage:** For mailing documents and small packages.
- **Snacks and refreshments:** Courtesies for [in-house](../i/in-house.md) meetings or visitors.
- **Transport and parking:** Quick disbursements for local travel.
- **Emergency repairs:** Small-scale repair work like fixing a door [handle](../h/handle.md).

### Operation and Workflow

1. **Establishing the [Fund](../f/fund.md):** A fixed amount of cash is allocated to the petty cash [fund](../f/fund.md) from the main [bank](../b/bank.md) account, typically managed by an assigned petty cash [custodian](../c/custodian.md).
2. **[Disbursement](../d/disbursement.md):** When a minor [expense](../e/expense.md) is incurred, [money](../m/money.md) is taken from the petty cash [fund](../f/fund.md) and a [voucher](../v/voucher.md) or receipt is completed for the [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md).
3. **Replenishment:** When the petty cash [fund](../f/fund.md) runs low, a [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) [check](../c/check.md) is issued, replenishing the [fund](../f/fund.md) to its original amount.

### Example Workflow

1. **Step 1:** Allocate $500 as the original petty cash [fund](../f/fund.md).
2. **Step 2:** Employee A spends $10 on office supplies; they fill out a petty cash [voucher](../v/voucher.md) and attach the receipt.
3. **Step 3:** [Custodian](../c/custodian.md) records the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) and the [fund](../f/fund.md) now has $490.
4. **Step 4:** Once the [fund](../f/fund.md) reaches around $100, request replenishment.
5. **Step 5:** [Issue](../i/issue.md) a [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) [check](../c/check.md) for $400 to bring the [fund](../f/fund.md) back to $500.

## Accounting for Petty Cash

### Initial Setup

When establishing a petty cash [fund](../f/fund.md), an initial [journal](../j/journal.md) entry debits the Petty Cash account and credits the Cash account.

```
[Debit](../d/debit.md): Petty Cash $500
[Credit](../c/credit.md): Cash $500
```

### Expense Records

Each [expense](../e/expense.md) [transaction](../t/transaction.md) needs to be properly recorded with a petty cash [voucher](../v/voucher.md) and receipt.

### Replenishment

When replenishing the [fund](../f/fund.md), summarize all petty cash expenses and write a [check](../c/check.md) to the [custodian](../c/custodian.md) to equal the total amount spent.

Example [journal](../j/journal.md) entries when replenishing:

```
[Debit](../d/debit.md): Office Supplies $10
[Debit](../d/debit.md): Travel [Expense](../e/expense.md) $30
[Debit](../d/debit.md): Miscellaneous [Expense](../e/expense.md) $20
[Credit](../c/credit.md): Cash $60
```

### Closing

To close petty cash at the end of a fiscal period, transfer petty cash balance back to the main Cash account.

```
[Debit](../d/debit.md): Cash $500
[Credit](../c/credit.md): Petty Cash $500
```

## Internal Controls

Effective [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md) are essential for managing a petty cash [fund](../f/fund.md), and can include:

- Limiting the amount of [money](../m/money.md) in the [fund](../f/fund.md) to a minimal necessary amount, generally $100-$500.
- Assigning a [custodian](../c/custodian.md) responsible for managing, disbursing, and reconciling the [fund](../f/fund.md).
- Requiring supporting documentation (vouchers, [receipts](../r/receipt.md)) for all payments made from the [fund](../f/fund.md).
- Conducting regular audits of the petty cash [fund](../f/fund.md) by someone independent of the [custodian](../c/custodian.md).

## Technology and Modern Solutions

### Digital Petty Cash Management

To address potential inefficiencies and risks associated with manual petty [cash management](../c/cash_management.md), many companies are turning to digital solutions. These systems provide an electronic method to manage petty cash transactions and include features such as:

- Automated [transaction](../t/transaction.md) logging.
- Digital receipt capture and storage.
- Real-time tracking and reporting.
- Enhanced [security](../s/security.md) and compliance measures.

### Example

**Spendesk** is a software that offers a comprehensive suite of tools for [business](../b/business.md) [expense](../e/expense.md) management, including petty cash Spendesk. Their platform allows for easy [expense](../e/expense.md) tracking, digitizing [receipts](../r/receipt.md), and better control over small cash expenditures.

## Conclusion

While often perceived as a minor aspect of financial management, petty cash plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth operation of day-to-day [business activities](../b/business_activities.md). Proper [accounting](../a/accounting.md), stringent [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md), and the adoption of modern digital solutions can make petty [cash management](../c/cash_management.md) more efficient, transparent, and secure.

By establishing clear procedures and leveraging technology, businesses can mitigate risks associated with petty cash and ensure more accurate financial reporting.
