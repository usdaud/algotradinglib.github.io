# Penetration Pricing Definition, Examples, and How to Use It

Penetration pricing is a [marketing strategy](../m/marketing_strategy.md) employed by businesses to attract customers to a new product or service by [offering](../o/offering.md) a significantly lower price during its initial [offering](../o/offering.md) stage. This approach aims to capture [market share](../m/market_share.md) quickly, attract customers away from competitors, and achieve [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md) early. Over time, once the [customer](../c/customer.md) base is established and the product or service gains popularity, the prices are gradually increased.

## Definition

Penetration pricing involves setting a low initial price for a new product or service with the intent to attract a large number of customers and [gain](../g/gain.md) [market share](../m/market_share.md) rapidly. This pricing strategy is particularly effective in price-sensitive markets where consumers are drawn to lower prices, and it is often used when entering competitive markets. Its temporary nature differentiates it from other pricing strategies such as cost-plus pricing or [value-based pricing](../v/value-based_pricing.md).

Penetration pricing serves several purposes, including:
- **Achieving [Market Penetration](../m/market_penetration.md)**: Quickly gaining a significant share of the [market](../m/market.md).
- **Building [Customer](../c/customer.md) Base**: Establishing a foundation of loyal customers who [will](../w/will.md) continue to purchase as prices rise.
- **Erecting [Barriers to Entry](../b/barriers_to_entry.md)**: Making it difficult for competitors to attract the same level of [customer](../c/customer.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) due to the lower initial price.
- **[Economies of Scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md)**: Increasing production [volume](../v/volume.md) to lower long-term unit costs.

## Examples of Penetration Pricing

### 1. **Netflix**
When Netflix initially launched its streaming service, it offered a very low subscription [fee](../f/fee.md) to undercut established competition like cable television providers and other streaming services. This low pricing strategy helped Netflix build a substantial subscriber base rapidly. Over time, as the service gained popularity and [customer](../c/customer.md) loyalty, Netflix gradually increased their subscription costs.

### 2. **Amazon**
Amazon frequently uses penetration pricing, especially in new markets like groceries or hardware (such as the Kindle Fire). When Amazon Fresh was first introduced, it offered significant discounts and offers to build a [customer](../c/customer.md) base. The Kindle Fire tablet was initially priced much lower than comparable products to quickly [gain](../g/gain.md) [market share](../m/market_share.md) and build an ecosystem around Amazon’s digital services.

### 3. **Xiaomi**
Xiaomi, a leading smartphone manufacturer, employs penetration pricing, particularly in emerging markets like India. By launching high-quality smartphones at lower prices than competitors, Xiaomi quickly garnered a large [customer](../c/customer.md) base. Once they cemented their position, they began to incrementally raise prices while introducing higher-end models.

## How to Use Penetration Pricing

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **[Market Research](../m/market_research.md)**:
 Conduct thorough [market research](../m/market_research.md) to understand [customer](../c/customer.md) preferences, [price sensitivity](../p/price_sensitivity.md), and evaluate the competitive landscape. Identify similar products or services and analyze their pricing strategies.

2. **Set Objectives**:
 Define clear [business](../b/business.md) objectives for the penetration pricing strategy—be it capturing [market share](../m/market_share.md), generating word-of-mouth, or deterring potential competitors.

3. **Pricing Decision**:
 Determine the initial low price point. This should be significantly lower than competitor prices but should still consider cost-covering and potential losses initially.

4. **Promotion Plan**:
 Develop an extensive [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and promotional plan to create awareness around the low pricing. Utilize [digital marketing](../d/digital_marketing.md), [social media](../s/social_media.md) campaigns, discounts, and introductory offers.

5. **Monitor Sales and [Market](../m/market.md) Response**:
 After launch, closely monitor sales [volume](../v/volume.md), [market penetration](../m/market_penetration.md) rate, and [customer](../c/customer.md) feedback. Be prepared to make adjustments based on [market](../m/market.md) reception.

6. **Gradual Price Increase**:
 Once a significant [market share](../m/market_share.md) and loyal [customer](../c/customer.md) base are achieved, begin to incrementally raise prices. Ensure that the price increase is justified with improved services, added features, or product updates to maintain [customer](../c/customer.md) satisfaction.

### Best Practices

1. **Quality [Assurance](../a/assurance.md)**:
 Ensure that the product or service quality remains high despite the low pricing. A positive [customer](../c/customer.md) experience is crucial in converting penetrative pricing efforts to long-term success.

2. **Communication**:
 Transparently communicate the reasons for any subsequent price increases. Customers are more accepting of price hikes if they understand the added [value](../v/value.md) or reason behind the increase.

3. **[Value](../v/value.md) Additions**:
 [Offer](../o/offer.md) additional [value](../v/value.md) or improved services during the transition to higher prices. This can include better [customer](../c/customer.md) support, enhanced features, or exclusive offers to retain the [customer](../c/customer.md) base.

4. **[Scalability](../s/scalability.md)**:
 Assess whether your production capabilities can scale sustainably with increased [demand](../d/demand.md). Failing to meet [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) can turn initial success into long-term struggles.

5. **Cost Management**:
 Closely manage costs to avoid substantial losses during the penetration phase. Balance between [offering](../o/offering.md) competitive prices and maintaining a sustainable [revenue](../r/revenue.md) model.

## Conclusion

Penetration pricing can be a potent strategy for new [market](../m/market.md) entries or launching new products, provided it is executed thoughtfully. By [offering](../o/offering.md) a lower price initially, businesses can rapidly build a [customer](../c/customer.md) base, establish [market share](../m/market_share.md), and achieve [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md). However, the transition from initial low pricing to higher prices requires careful planning, clear communication, and continuous evaluation to ensure long-term success.
