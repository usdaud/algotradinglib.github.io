# Poison Pill

The term "Poison Pill" refers to a strategy used by companies to thwart [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md) attempts. A [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md) occurs when a company (the acquirer) attempts to take control of another company (the target) against the wishes of the target’s management. Poison pill strategies can make the target company less attractive to potential acquirers, or at least more costly to buy out, thereby protecting the [incumbent](../i/incumbent.md) management.

## Definition and Mechanism

A poison pill, technically known as a "[shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) rights plan," is a tactic used by a company's board of directors to prevent or discourage a [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md). The poison pill allows existing shareholders the right to purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md) at a discounted rate, effectively diluting the share [value](../v/value.md) and making the [takeover](../t/takeover.md) prohibitively expensive for the acquirer.

### Types of Poison Pills

There are various types of poison pills, and they are typically classified into two main categories: the "[flip](../f/flip.md)-in" and the "[flip](../f/flip.md)-over."

1. **[Flip](../f/flip.md)-In Poison Pill**: This allows existing shareholders (excluding the acquirer) to purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md) at a [discount](../d/discount.md). For instance, if a particular threshold of ownership is breached by the potential acquirer (usually 10-20% of existing [shares](../s/shares.md)), the other shareholders can buy more [shares](../s/shares.md) at a [discount](../d/discount.md). This dilutes the ownership [interest](../i/interest.md) of the acquirer and makes the [takeover](../t/takeover.md) more expensive and challenging to accomplish.

2. **[Flip](../f/flip.md)-Over Poison Pill**: This allows shareholders to purchase the acquirer’s [shares](../s/shares.md) at a discounted rate after the [takeover](../t/takeover.md). This dilutes the [value](../v/value.md) of the acquirer’s [shares](../s/shares.md), making the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) less attractive.

## History and Evolution

The poison pill was first introduced in the 1980s. One of the earliest and most famous cases was when Martin Lipton, a corporate lawyer at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, designed the poison pill strategy in response to the wave of hostile takeovers during that period. The strategy quickly gained popularity among companies looking to protect themselves from corporate raiders.

### Legal Landscape

The legality and structure of poison pills can vary significantly depending on jurisdiction. For example, in the United States, the Delaware Court of Chancery has played a significant role in shaping the legal framework surrounding poison pills. Delaware is [home](../h/home.md) to many large American corporations due to its [business](../b/business.md)-friendly laws.

## Advantages of Poison Pills

1. **Prevention of Hostile Takeovers**: The primary goal of a poison pill is to protect the company from a [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md), giving the existing management more time to find alternative solutions or negotiate better terms.

2. **[Negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) [Leverage](../l/leverage.md)**: By implementing a poison pill, the target company gains [leverage](../l/leverage.md) in negotiations. The acquirer might be willing to [offer](../o/offer.md) a better price or more favorable terms to ensure the [takeover](../t/takeover.md)'s success.

3. **Protection of Minority Shareholders**: Poison pills can prevent the new [majority shareholder](../m/majority_shareholder.md) from making unilateral decisions that may not benefit minority shareholders.

4. **Corporate Stability**: Poison pills can provide stability to a company's operations and strategic planning, ensuring that the existing management can continue to execute long-term plans without disruption.

## Disadvantages of Poison Pills

1. **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md) of [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: The issuance of new [shares](../s/shares.md) at a [discount](../d/discount.md) can significantly dilute the [value](../v/value.md) of existing [shares](../s/shares.md), potentially harming [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

2. **Management Entrenchment**: Poison pills can sometimes be seen as a way for [incumbent](../i/incumbent.md) management to entrench themselves and protect their positions rather than acting in the best interests of shareholders.

3. **Decreased Attractiveness to Investors**: The presence of a poison pill may deter potential investors who are concerned about reduced [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of their investments.

4. **Complexity and Costs**: Implementing and maintaining a poison pill strategy involves legal and administrative complexities, which may result in additional costs for the company.

## Notable Case Studies

### Netflix and Icahn

One notable case involved Netflix. In 2012, Netflix adopted a poison pill strategy to prevent a [takeover](../t/takeover.md) attempt by the [activist investor](../a/activist_investor.md) Carl Icahn. Icahn had acquired a significant stake in the company and was pushing for a [sale](../s/sale.md). Netflix's adoption of the poison pill helped to protect the company and its strategic vision.

### Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank

In another case, Men's Wearhouse used a poison pill to fend off an [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) attempt by Jos. A. [Bank](../b/bank.md). Eventually, the negotiations led to a [merger](../m/merger.md), where Men's Wearhouse acquired Jos. A. [Bank](../b/bank.md) instead, a turn of events made possible by the initial poison pill strategy.

## Implementing a Poison Pill

### Steps to Implementation

1. **Board Approval**: The board of directors must approve the implementation of a poison pill strategy. This typically involves consulting with legal advisors to draft the terms of the poison pill.

2. **Notification**: Once approved, the company must notify all shareholders about the adoption of the poison pill and the conditions under which it [will](../w/will.md) be triggered.

3. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: The details of the poison pill [will](../w/will.md) be executed as outlined in the plan, including the issuance of new [shares](../s/shares.md) when the specific threshold is breached.

### Key Considerations

- **Threshold Levels**: The company must decide the ownership percentage that triggers the poison pill. This is typically in the [range](../r/range.md) of 10-20% but can vary.

- **[Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md)**: The [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) for purchasing additional [shares](../s/shares.md) must be determined. The [discount](../d/discount.md) should be attractive enough to encourage existing shareholders to buy more [shares](../s/shares.md).

- **[Duration](../d/duration.md)**: Poison pills are not meant to be permanent. The board should set an [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) for the poison pill, which can often be extended if necessary.

### Example of a Poison Pill Implementation

One classic example is how Tesla, under Elon Musk's [leadership](../l/leadership.md), implemented a poison pill in 2018. This measure was adopted as a defensive strategy against potential hostile takeovers and to maintain the company's strategic and operational independence.

## Future Trends and Considerations

### Legal and Regulatory Changes

As [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) standards evolve, regulatory bodies may impose new rules and limitations on the implementation of poison pills. Investors, [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) advocacy groups, and regulatory agencies increasingly [demand](../d/demand.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability from companies.

### Shareholder Activism

With the rise of [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism, companies are more frequently facing pressure from activist investors. Poison pills are just one of the tools that companies can use to fend off hostile advances. The use of poison pills must be balanced against the potential backlash from shareholders who may view this as a mechanism for entrenchment rather than [value](../v/value.md) creation.

### Technological and Market Factors

The [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) continuously evolve, with increased use of algorithms and sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Poison pills must be designed to be [robust](../r/robust.md) enough to [handle](../h/handle.md) various types of [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) strategies, including those that may utilize cutting-edge financial technology.

### Alternative Strategies

Companies might consider alternative defensive strategies to poison pills. These can include:

- **[White Knight](../w/white_knight.md)**: Seeking a more favorable company to acquire them instead of the hostile bidder.
- **[Pac-Man Defense](../p/pac-man_defense.md)**: The target company tries to acquire the hostile bidder.
- **Crown Jewel Defense**: Selling off the most valuable assets to diminish attractiveness.
- **[Golden Parachute](../g/golden_parachute.md)**: Executives receive substantial benefits if terminated due to [takeover](../t/takeover.md).

## Conclusion

Poison pills are a significant part of a company's defensive toolkit against hostile takeovers. While providing vital protection and [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) [leverage](../l/leverage.md), they also carry inherent risks and downsides like share [dilution](../d/dilution.md) and potential management entrenchment. The use of poison pills is a complex, legally intricate strategy that requires careful consideration, clear communication with shareholders, and often the [guidance](../g/guidance.md) of legal and financial advisors. As the legal and [market](../m/market.md) landscapes continue to shift, companies [will](../w/will.md) need to adapt their strategies to balance effective defense measures with the overarching goal of [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md) creation.
