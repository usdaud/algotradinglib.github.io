# Pink Sheets

## Introduction to Pink Sheets

Pink Sheets is a term that refers to a daily publication compiled by the National [Quotation](../q/quotation.md) Bureau (NQB), now known as OTC Markets Group. It lists over-the-counter (OTC) [stocks](../s/stock.md), including the prices at which they were traded by [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers. The name "Pink Sheets" derives from the color of the paper on which the quotes were historically printed. For many investors, Pink Sheets represent high-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-reward opportunities, often associated with smaller, lesser-known companies that are not [listed](../l/listed.md) on major stock exchanges.

## Characteristics of Pink Sheets

### Lack of Regulation

Pink Sheet [stocks](../s/stock.md) are not required to meet the stringent reporting and regulatory requirements of major exchanges like the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) or the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md). This lack of regulation can be both a positive and a negative. While it allows smaller companies to [gain](../g/gain.md) access to [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md), it also exposes investors to higher risks due to a lack of reliable financial information and potential for [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Wide Range of Companies

The companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the Pink Sheets cover a wide [range](../r/range.md) of industries and sizes. Some are well-established firms that have chosen not to list on major exchanges, while others are relatively new or struggling businesses. Due to the diversity, the Pink Sheets can [offer](../o/offer.md) both growth opportunities and cautionary examples.

### Liquidity Issues

[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can be a significant [issue](../i/issue.md) with Pink Sheet [stocks](../s/stock.md). Since they are traded over-the-counter through a network of dealers rather than on centralized exchanges, the trading [volume](../v/volume.md) is often much lower. This can make it difficult to buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md) without affecting the stock price significantly.

### Price Volatility

The prices of Pink Sheet [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be highly volatile. This [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can be driven by a variety of factors including the lack of comprehensive financial reporting, low trading volumes, and the overall smaller size of the companies. Investors can experience large swings in stock prices, both upward and downward.

## Types of Pink Sheets Securities

### Penny Stocks

Many of the securities traded on the Pink Sheets are [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md), which are typically defined as [stocks](../s/stock.md) trading below $5 per share. These [stocks](../s/stock.md) are known for their speculative nature and potential for large gains or losses in short periods.

### Foreign Securities

The Pink Sheets also include foreign securities that are not available on U.S. exchanges. These foreign companies may find it easier to access U.S. investors through the Pink Sheets due to fewer regulatory hurdles.

### Micro-cap Stocks

Micro-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md) are another category frequently found in the Pink Sheets. These companies usually have a [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of less than $300 million. They are considered high-[risk](../r/risk.md) but can also [offer](../o/offer.md) high-reward opportunities.

## Pink Sheets Tiers

The OTC Markets Group, which now operates the Pink Sheets, has divided the [market](../m/market.md) into different tiers to help investors assess the [risk](../r/risk.md) and information availability of [listed](../l/listed.md) companies.

### OTCQX

The [OTCQX](../o/otcqx.md) tier represents the highest quality companies traded over-the-counter. These firms are financially stable and comply with more rigorous reporting and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements. They do not qualify for listing on [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) or other major exchanges but are considered credible investment [options](../o/options.md).

### OTCQB

OTCQB is known as the "Venture [Market](../m/market.md)" and includes early-stage and developing U.S. and international companies. They are required to report to a U.S. regulator like the SEC or a suitable international equivalent. This tier offers more [transparency](../t/transparency.md) than lower tiers but carries higher [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to [OTCQX](../o/otcqx.md).

### Pink Open Market

Also known as the Pink Sheets, the Pink [Open Market](../o/open_market.md) is further classified into three segments based on the level of information available:

- **Current Information:** Companies in this segment provide regular reporting and are generally more transparent.
- **Limited Information:** These companies have limited reporting, [offering](../o/offering.md) some insight but not meeting the criteria for higher tiers.
- **No Information:** The riskiest segment, companies in this category do not provide any financial information, making them highly speculative.

## Regulation and Compliance

### SEC Oversight

While Pink Sheets are less regulated compared to major exchanges, they still fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). Companies must adhere to anti-[fraud](../f/fraud.md) provisions and other rules designed to protect investors.

### Rule 15c2-11

SEC Rule 15c2-11 requires [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers to review specific company information before initiating a [quote](../q/quote.md) in the Pink Sheets. This rule aims to provide some level of [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md), but the effectiveness in ensuring [investor](../i/investor.md) protection is limited compared to fully regulated exchanges.

### Pink Sheets and Sarbanes-Oxley Act

The [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](../s/sarbanes-oxley_(sox)_act_of_2002.md), enacted to enhance corporate responsibility and financial disclosures, does not apply directly to Pink Sheets companies unless they voluntarily choose to comply or are also [listed](../l/listed.md) on a major [exchange](../e/exchange.md). This lack of stringent regulatory oversight can increase the [risk](../r/risk.md) for investors.

## Trading on Pink Sheets

### How to Trade

Investors can [trade](../t/trade.md) Pink Sheets securities through most online brokerage accounts. It is important to [note](../n/note.md) that due to the decentralized nature of OTC trading, finding the best price can be challenging. The use of limit orders over [market](../m/market.md) orders is often recommended to minimize the [risk](../r/risk.md) of unfavorable price [execution](../e/execution.md).

### Costs and Fees

Trading Pink Sheets [stocks](../s/stock.md) often involves higher costs and fees than trading on major exchanges. This includes wider [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md), which can add to the overall trading cost. Investors should be aware of these additional expenses when considering investments in Pink Sheets securities.

### Research and Due Diligence

Conducting thorough research and [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) is crucial when [investing](../i/investing.md) in Pink Sheets. Given the lack of comprehensive financial disclosures, investors should look for any available information, including press releases, company websites, and third-party research reports. Skepticism and caution are advised.

## Risks and Rewards

### High Risk

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in Pink Sheets [stocks](../s/stock.md) is inherently risky due to the lack of regulation, financial [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and historical performance data. Investors must be willing to accept the possibility of significant losses.

### High Reward

Despite the high risks, Pink Sheets can [offer](../o/offer.md) substantial rewards. Investors who perform diligent research may identify [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) companies with strong potential for growth. Success stories, although rare, do exist.

### Potential for Fraud

The [over-the-counter market](../o/over-the-counter_market.md) has historically been a breeding ground for fraudulent activities, including pump-and-dump schemes where stock prices are artificially inflated to attract unwary investors before being dumped by the fraudsters, leading to significant losses.

## Historical Context and Development

### Origins

The concept of over-the-counter trading in the U.S. dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Initially, trades were negotiated directly between parties without a centralized [exchange](../e/exchange.md). The National [Quotation](../q/quotation.md) Bureau began publishing daily stock quotes on pink-colored paper in 1913, giving rise to the term "Pink Sheets."

### Evolution to OTC Markets Group

In 1999, the National [Quotation](../q/quotation.md) Bureau was rebranded as Pink Sheets LLC. The rise of internet technology facilitated the transition to an electronic [quotation](../q/quotation.md) system. The company was eventually renamed OTC Markets Group Inc. in 2008, [offering](../o/offering.md) a more structured and tiered marketplace for over-the-counter securities.

### Modernization

OTC Markets Group has modernized the Pink Sheets by introducing electronic trading platforms and enhancing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) through the segmentation of securities into different tiers based on information availability and compliance. This has helped mitigate some risks but has not entirely eliminated the inherent challenges of OTC trading.

## The Role of Technology

### Online Brokerages

The advent of online brokerage platforms has made trading Pink Sheets more accessible to individual investors. These platforms provide tools for research, charting, and trading, albeit with the associated risks still present.

### Automated Trading

Algorithmic and [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) have also entered the OTC [market](../m/market.md). Although more common in major exchanges, these technologies are increasingly used to identify trading opportunities in the Pink Sheets, leveraging [big data](../b/big_data_in_trading.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models.

### Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

The rise of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology and cryptocurrencies has sparked [interest](../i/interest.md) in decentralized financial systems. Some Pink Sheets companies are exploring or have integrated [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) solutions, attracting a new generation of tech-savvy investors.

### Fintech Innovations

Financial technology (fintech) innovations continue to influence the Pink Sheets. Enhanced [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md), [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment tools, and robo-advisors are some of the fintech solutions that assist investors in navigating the OTC [market](../m/market.md).

## Conclusion

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in Pink Sheets can be an attractive option for those willing to embrace the accompanying risks. The [market](../m/market.md) provides opportunities to discover [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) with substantial growth potential. However, the lack of regulation, financial instability of [listed](../l/listed.md) companies, and potential for fraudulent activities necessitate comprehensive research and cautious investment strategies. Whether you are a seasoned [investor](../i/investor.md) or a newcomer, understanding the intricacies of the Pink Sheets is essential for making informed decisions.
