# Price Breakout

A price breakout occurs when price moves beyond a defined support or resistance level with momentum. Breakouts can signal the start of a new trend or continuation of an existing one.

## Common breakout levels
- Prior swing highs or lows.
- Consolidation ranges.
- Chart patterns such as triangles or flags.

## Example
A stock trades in a range between 40 and 42 for two weeks. When price closes above 42 with rising volume, traders call it a breakout.

## Risks
False breakouts are common, especially in low volume or choppy markets. Confirmation and risk control are important.

## Practical notes
Breakouts are often traded with a stop back inside the range and a target based on the range height.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Price Breakout and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Price Breakout as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Price Breakout, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Price Breakout. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Price Breakout alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
