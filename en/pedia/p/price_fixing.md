# Price Fixing

Price fixing refers to an agreement between participants on the same side of a [market](../m/market.md) to buy or sell a product, service, or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) only at a fixed price, or maintain the [market](../m/market.md) conditions such that the price is maintained at a certain level by controlling [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md). This term is often associated with illegal activities due to its capacity to disrupt free-[market](../m/market.md) competition and harm consumers.

## Types of Price Fixing

Price fixing can manifest in several forms. Here are the most common:

### Horizontal Price Fixing

Horizontal price fixing occurs when competitors who produce and sell the same products or services agree to charge the same prices. This type is the most notorious and usually involves companies conspiring to sell at a certain price, limiting [market](../m/market.md) competition.

### Vertical Price Fixing

Vertical price fixing involves agreements between manufacturers and retailers, or between different levels within a [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md). For instance, a manufacturer may require a retailer to sell its product at a minimum price, thereby preventing the retailer from lowering prices to attract more customers.

### Bid Rigging

This specific type of price fixing happens in [procurement](../p/procurement.md) where companies collude to decide who [will](../w/will.md) win the [bid](../b/bid.md) and at what price. It is a common [issue](../i/issue.md) in instances of public [procurement](../p/procurement.md) and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects.

### Market Allocation

In some cases, companies might agree to divide markets among themselves rather than fixing prices directly. Each company [will](../w/will.md) have exclusive rights over a region or a segment of the [market](../m/market.md), indirectly ensuring control over prices.

## Legal Framework

Price fixing is illegal in many jurisdictions because it undermines the principles of a competitive [market](../m/market.md), harming consumers through higher prices and reduced choices.

### United States

In the United States, price fixing is illegal under Section 1 of the [Sherman Antitrust Act](../s/sherman_antitrust_act.md) (1890). This act prohibits “every contract, combination in the form of [trust](../t/trust.md) or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of [trade](../t/trade.md) or [commerce](../c/commerce.md) among the several States, or with foreign nations.” Penalties for violating this act can be severe, including heavy fines and imprisonment.

### European Union

In the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), price fixing is prohibited under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) (TFEU). The European [Commission](../c/commission.md) has the authority to enforce these rules and can impose significant fines on companies found to be engaging in such practices.

### Other Jurisdictions

Many other countries also have their own legal frameworks to prevent price fixing. These frameworks are often guided by international standards and practices, particularly those promoted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

## Detection and Enforcement

### Whistleblowers

Often, price fixing schemes are brought to light by insiders or whistleblowers. These individuals may report illegal activities to authorities in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for leniency or immunity.

### Investigations

Regulatory bodies can also investigate suspected cases of price fixing. This process usually involves reviewing communications, contracts, and activities of the companies involved to find evidence of [collusion](../c/collusion.md).

### Penalties

Penalties for price fixing can [range](../r/range.md) from civil fines to criminal charges. Companies can face hefty fines that can run into millions of dollars, and individuals can be sentenced to prison.

## Famous Cases

### Lysine Price-Fixing Conspiracy

One of the most infamous cases of price fixing in the 1990s involved lysine, an amino acid used in animal feed. Five companies, including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), colluded to control the [supply](../s/supply.md) and set prices. This case drew significant media attention and led to substantial fines and criminal charges.

### Apple E-Books Case

In 2013, Apple Inc. faced legal action from the United States Department of Justice for allegedly conspiring with five major publishers to fix the prices of e-books. The case revealed that Apple had agreed with publishers to set higher prices, which affected the [market](../m/market.md) significantly.

## Economic Impact

### Consumer Harm

The primary victim of price fixing is the consumer, who ends up paying higher prices. This lack of competition also leads to a reduction in innovation since companies do not feel the need to improve products or services to attract customers.

### Market Distortion

Price fixing disrupts the natural forces of [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md), leading to [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies. It reduces the overall [welfare](../w/welfare.md) of the [economy](../e/economy.md) and stifles enterprise and innovation, harming [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Price Fixing in the Digital Age

The advent of technology has added layers of complexity to detecting and preventing price fixing. Algorithms employed in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and fintech sectors can be manipulated to fix prices without human intervention, making traditional methods of detection less effective.

### Algorithms and Machine Learning

In markets where [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is prominent, the algorithms themselves can be programmed to follow pre-set pricing strategies that mimic collusive behavior. Legal frameworks are evolving to address these new challenges, but there remains a significant gap in regulation and enforcement.

### Blockchain and Transparency

On the [flip](../f/flip.md) side, [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology offers promising solutions to enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and traceability in pricing. [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) can be implemented to ensure that all transactions are recorded in an immutable, transparent ledger, making it easier to detect and prevent price fixing schemes.

## Ethical Considerations

While most discussions around price fixing focus on legal and economic consequences, ethical considerations are also paramount. Companies involved in these practices breach [trust](../t/trust.md) with both customers and the [market](../m/market.md) at large. These actions not only harm individual consumers but can also damage the reputation of the [industry](../i/industry.md) as a whole.

## Conclusion

Price fixing is a significant [issue](../i/issue.md) in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and everyday [commerce](../c/commerce.md). While the primary focus has traditionally been on brick-and-mortar businesses, there is increasing attention on digital markets and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) practices. As legal frameworks catch up with technological advancements, the enforcement and detection strategies must also evolve. The ultimate goal is to preserve fair [market](../m/market.md) practices, protect consumers, and foster an environment where innovation can thrive.
