# Prospect Theory Heuristics

[Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) is a foundational concept in [behavioral economics](../b/behavioral_economics.md) that explains how people make decisions under conditions of [risk](../r/risk.md) and [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the late 1970s, this theory challenges the expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md), which is a cornerstone of [classical economics](../c/classical_economics.md). Expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) assumes that individuals act rationally to maximize their [expected utility](../e/expected_utility.md). However, Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated that real-world decision-making often deviates from this rationality due to [cognitive biases](../c/cognitive_biases_in_trading.md) and [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md).

#### Key Concepts of Prospect Theory

1. **[Value](../v/value.md) Function**:
   - People evaluate outcomes based on a subjective [value](../v/value.md) function that is concave for gains and convex for losses. This asymmetry means individuals are generally [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) when dealing with potential gains and [risk](../r/risk.md)-seeking when faced with potential losses.
   - The [value](../v/value.md) function is steeper for losses than for gains, reflecting [loss aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md) â€” the phenomenon where losses loom larger than gains of the same magnitude.

2. **Reference Dependence**:
   - Decisions are made based on changes relative to a reference point rather than on absolute outcomes. The reference point can be influenced by the individual's current state, expectations, or context.
   
3. **Probability Weighting**:
   - People tend to overestimate the likelihood of extreme but unlikely events and underestimate the likelihood of moderate but more probable occurrences. This leads to a nonlinear probability weighting function.

4. **[Loss Aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md)**:
   - Individuals exhibit a stronger emotional reaction to losses compared to gains. Empirical studies suggest that the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining.

5. **Certainty Effect**:
   - People [overweight](../o/overweight.md) outcomes that are considered certain relative to those that are merely probable. This can lead to [risk](../r/risk.md) aversion if outcomes are perceived as gains, and [risk](../r/risk.md)-seeking if outcomes are perceived as losses.

#### Implications for Algo Trading

[Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) has crucial implications for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (algo trading), as it helps model and predict [investor](../i/investor.md) behavior and [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). Traders and quant analysts can incorporate these behavioral insights into algorithms to better anticipate [market](../m/market.md) movements and develop strategies that exploit inefficiencies created by human biases.

#### Heuristics in Trading

[Heuristics](../h/heuristics.md) are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that simplify decision-making. In the context of trading, [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md) can lead to systematic biases but can also be harnessed to improve [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

1. **[Anchoring](../a/anchoring.md)**:
   - Traders might fixate on specific prices ([anchoring](../a/anchoring.md)) as reference points, leading to biased evaluations of [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Algorithms can be designed to detect and counteract [anchoring](../a/anchoring.md) effects by relying on broader data analysis rather than fixed points.

2. **Availability Heuristic**:
   - Traders are influenced by information that is most readily available, which might not be the most relevant. For example, recent [market](../m/market.md) news can disproportionately affect trading decisions. Algorithms can counteract this by incorporating a wider historical context.

3. **Representativeness**:
   - Traders might judge the probability of an event based on how much it resembles their existing stereotypes, rather than on its actual statistical probability. Algorithms can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) more accurate probabilistic models to mitigate this effect.

#### Practical Applications

Several companies and platforms have successfully integrated [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) and [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md) into their [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies:

1. **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)**:
   - [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/) is an [open](../o/open.md)-source [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platform that allows traders to design, backtest, and deploy [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). It uses advanced [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) to address [behavioral biases](../b/behavioral_biases_in_trading.md) explained by [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md).

2. **Kensho Technologies**:
   - [Kensho Technologies](https://home.kensho.com/) leverages [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and advanced analytics to interpret vast amounts of data and predicts [market](../m/market.md) movements with an awareness of [behavioral biases](../b/behavioral_biases_in_trading.md).

3. **Sigmoid [Capital](../c/capital.md)**:
   - [Sigmoid Capital](https://www.sigmoidcapital.com/) focuses on using [behavioral economics](../b/behavioral_economics.md) to guide their investment strategies. They employ algorithms that account for [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment and [market](../m/market.md) psychology in their [trading models](../t/trading_models.md).

4. **Sentieo**:
   - [Sentieo](https://sentieo.com/) combines advanced financial [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) with behavioral models to provide [trade](../t/trade.md) insights. Their platform allows traders to understand [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) influenced by [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md) and biases.

#### Criticisms and Limitations

While [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) has significantly advanced the understanding of human decision-making, it is not without criticisms:

1. **Descriptive, Not Prescriptive**:
   - The theory primarily describes how decisions are made rather than prescribing optimal decision rules. This limits its direct applicability in formulating [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

2. **Context Dependence**:
   - The reference point is context-dependent and can change, making it challenging to model consistently in [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

3. **Complexity in Modeling**:
   - Accurately modeling [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) in algorithms involves sophisticated mathematics and can be computationally intensive.

Despite these limitations, integrating insights from [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) and [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md) into [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) offers a more nuanced approach to understanding and predicting [market](../m/market.md) behavior, ultimately leading to more [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that can adapt to the nuances of human psychology.
