# Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD)

Post-[Earnings Announcement](../e/earnings_announcement.md) Drift (PEAD) is a well-documented [market](../m/market.md) [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) where the stock prices continue to drift in the direction of an [earnings](../e/earnings.md) surprise for a period of time following an [earnings announcement](../e/earnings_announcement.md). This phenomenon contradicts the [Efficient Market Hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md) (EMH), which posits that stock prices should instantaneously adjust to new information. PEAD suggests that investors do not immediately fully price in the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) news, leading to a gradual adjustment that traders can potentially exploit. 

### Historical Context and Discovery

The concept of PEAD became widely recognized through the work of Ray Ball and Philip Brown in the late 1960s, who highlighted that stock prices seemed to slowly adjust to [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md). Subsequent research in the 1980s and 1990s further validated these findings, showing that stock returns could predictably move in the direction of [earnings surprises](../e/earnings_surprises.md) over time frames spanning from days to several months after the announcement.

### Mechanisms and Causes

Several proposed mechanisms explain why PEAD occurs:

1. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Inattention:** Investors may not fully process or react to the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) news immediately, leading to a delayed response. 
2. **Information Diffusion:** Information may not be evenly distributed among [market](../m/market.md) participants. Some investors may receive and act upon information faster than others.
3. **[Behavioral Biases](../b/behavioral_biases_in_trading.md):** Psychological factors, such as overconfidence or [anchoring](../a/anchoring.md), can cause investors to misprice [stocks](../s/stock.md) immediately following [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md).
4. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [Trading Costs](../t/trading_costs.md):** Constraints in trading [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and the presence of [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) might delay the price adjustment process.

### Measuring PEAD

PEAD is typically measured by examining the stock's abnormal returns following an [earnings announcement](../e/earnings_announcement.md). Abnormal returns are the returns that exceed what would be expected based on [market](../m/market.md) movements and [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md), often calculated using a [market](../m/market.md) model or a multifactor model such as the Fama-French three-[factor](../f/factor.md) model.

1. **Calculation of [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Surprise:** The actual [earnings](../e/earnings.md) are compared to consensus analyst forecasts to determine if there is an [earnings](../e/earnings.md) surprise. 
2. **[Event Study Methodology](../e/event_study_methodology.md):** Researchers use [event study](../e/event_study.md) methods to analyze stock price reactions in days or months following the [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md).
3. **Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CARs):** These are calculated to quantify the total price drift over a specified period.

### PEAD in Different Market Conditions

PEAD can behave differently based on various [market](../m/market.md) conditions and factors:

1. **[Market Efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md):** In more efficient markets with high information dissemination, PEAD might be weaker. 
2. **[Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md):** Bullish or bearish [market](../m/market.md) conditions could amplify or dampen PEAD effects.
3. **[Firm](../f/firm.md) Characteristics:** The size of the [firm](../f/firm.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [industry](../i/industry.md) sector, and other [firm](../f/firm.md)-specific variables can impact the extent of PEAD.

### Exploiting PEAD in Trading Strategies

Numerous [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) have been developed to exploit PEAD. These include:

1. **[Momentum](../m/momentum.md) Strategies:** These strategies involve going long on [stocks](../s/stock.md) with positive [earnings surprises](../e/earnings_surprises.md) and shorting those with negative surprises. 
2. **Quantitative Algorithms:** Many [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and trading firms have developed sophisticated algorithms to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on PEAD, incorporating other financial metrics and indicators for enhanced prediction.

### Real-World Applications and Companies

Several companies and platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) tools and services to help traders exploit PEAD:

1. **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md):** An [open](../o/open.md) [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platform [offering](../o/offering.md) data, [cloud computing](../c/cloud_computing_in_trading.md), and libraries to backtest and deploy PEAD strategies. [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/)
2. **Kensho Technologies:** Provides analytics and data tools to identify and act on PEAD through [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md). [Kensho](https://www.kensho.com/)
3. **[Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) Terminal:** A professional financial data and software tool providing extensive data on [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and stock performance to allow traders to track PEAD. [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal/)
4. **[FactSet](../f/factset.md):** Offers [earnings](../e/earnings.md) data, predictions, and analytics tools geared towards identifying and leveraging PEAD opportunities. [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/)

### Challenges and Risks

While exploiting PEAD can be profitable, there are challenges and risks:

1. **[Model Risk](../m/model_risk.md):** Statistical models are only as good as their assumptions and input data. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to significant losses.
2. **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md):** High-frequency [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) designed to exploit PEAD can incur substantial [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), which may erode profits.
3. **Regulatory Risks:** Regulatory changes can impact the availability and timeliness of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) data, affecting PEAD strategies.
4. **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md):** Sudden [market](../m/market.md) changes due to macroeconomic factors, [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md), or [firm](../f/firm.md)-specific news can affect stock prices, independent of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) information.

### Conclusion

Post-[Earnings Announcement](../e/earnings_announcement.md) Drift (PEAD) remains an intriguing [market](../m/market.md) [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) that offers both opportunities and challenges for traders and investors. By understanding the mechanisms behind PEAD and utilizing modern trading tools and techniques, traders can potentially enhance their investment strategies. However, it's crucial to remain aware of the associated risks and to utilize [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices to mitigate potential downsides.
