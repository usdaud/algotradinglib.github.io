# Permanent Income Hypothesis

The Permanent [Income](../i/income.md) Hypothesis (PIH) is a theory of consumer spending that was developed by the [economist](../e/economist.md) [Milton Friedman](../m/milton_friedman.md) in 1957. According to this hypothesis, a person’s consumption at a point in time is determined not just by their current [income](../i/income.md), but by their longer-term [income](../i/income.md) expectations. Essentially, the PIH suggests that people smooth their consumption over time, basing their spending decisions on an estimate of their "permanent" or long-term average [income](../i/income.md) rather than on their current [income](../i/income.md), which may fluctuate due to temporary changes.

## Key Concepts

### Permanent vs. Transitory Income

- **Permanent [Income](../i/income.md):** This represents an individual’s long-term average [income](../i/income.md) or an estimate of their lifelong expected [earnings](../e/earnings.md). Permanent [income](../i/income.md) is considered to be more stable and is the [basis](../b/basis.md) upon which individuals plan their consumption.

- **Transitory [Income](../i/income.md):** This refers to short-term deviations from the permanent [income](../i/income.md), caused by one-off events such as bonuses or temporary redundancies. Transitory [income](../i/income.md) can be either positive or negative and tends to be more volatile and unpredictable.

### Consumption Smoothing

The core idea behind the Permanent [Income](../i/income.md) Hypothesis is that individuals prefer to smooth their consumption over time. Rather than adjusting their consumption sharply in response to changes in current [income](../i/income.md), they spread out their consumption to maintain a relatively stable [standard of living](../s/standard_of_living.md). This behavior can be attributed to [utility maximization](../u/utility_maximization.md); consumers derive greater satisfaction from a stable consumption pattern as opposed to one that sees wild fluctuations.

### Utility Maximization

Consumers aim to maximize their [utility](../u/utility.md), or satisfaction, over their lifetime. Under the PIH, [utility](../u/utility.md) is maximized when consumption is evenly distributed over time. Therefore, when faced with a temporary increase in [income](../i/income.md), a consumer is likely to save a portion of that [income](../i/income.md) rather than increasing their spending proportionally. Conversely, when [income](../i/income.md) temporarily dips, consumers are likely to draw from their savings or borrow to maintain a stable consumption level.

### Saving and Borrowing

Saving and borrowing play a critical role in the PIH framework. Individuals save during periods of higher-than-average [income](../i/income.md) and dissave (spend their savings or borrow) during periods of lower-than-average [income](../i/income.md). This behavior allows them to smooth their consumption based on their permanent [income](../i/income.md) rather than being forced to adjust their lifestyle according to short-term [income](../i/income.md) fluctuations.

## Implications for Economic Policy

### Fiscal Policy

According to the PIH, temporary tax cuts or stimulus checks may have a limited effect on consumer spending since individuals [will](../w/will.md) perceive these as transitory [income](../i/income.md) changes. They are more likely to save the additional [income](../i/income.md) or use it to pay down [debt](../d/debt.md) rather than significantly increasing their consumption. For [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md) to be effective in stimulating consumption, it would need to affect individuals' perceptions of their permanent [income](../i/income.md).

### Monetary Policy

The PIH also suggests that traditional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tools, such as [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) adjustments, might have a nuanced impact on consumption. Lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates may not immediately lead to increased consumer spending because individuals who perceive their [income](../i/income.md) increase as temporary might prefer to save rather than spend the additional [income](../i/income.md).

## Empirical Evidence

Empirical tests of the Permanent [Income](../i/income.md) Hypothesis have produced mixed results. Some studies have found evidence supporting the theory, while others have found that consumption is more closely tied to current [income](../i/income.md) than the PIH would predict.

### Supportive Evidence

- Studies using microdata from household surveys often find patterns consistent with the PIH, such as a smaller marginal propensity to consume out of transitory [income](../i/income.md) compared to permanent [income](../i/income.md).
- High-[income](../i/income.md) households, who are more likely to have savings and access to [credit](../c/credit.md), tend to exhibit behavior more in line with the PIH compared to low-[income](../i/income.md) households who may be [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) constrained.

### Contradictory Evidence

- Some studies have found that consumption reacts more strongly to changes in current [income](../i/income.md) than the PIH would suggest. This could be due to [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) constraints, lack of access to [credit](../c/credit.md), or consumers misunderstanding their permanent [income](../i/income.md).
- Behavioral factors such as myopia (shortsightedness) and lack of self-control can cause deviations from the consumption patterns predicted by the PIH.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading and Fintech

The Permanent [Income](../i/income.md) Hypothesis can also have interesting applications in the fields of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and financial technology (fintech).

### Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), understanding consumer behavior in response to changes in [income](../i/income.md) can be valuable for predicting [market](../m/market.md) trends. Algorithms can incorporate aspects of the PIH to forecast future consumption patterns based on long-term [income](../i/income.md) trends rather than short-term fluctuations. For example, [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) could be developed to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on expected changes in consumption trends following sustained changes in [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) that affect permanent [income](../i/income.md).

### Financial Planning and Robo-Advisors

Fintech companies, particularly those involved in [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and robo-advisory services, can use the principles of the PIH to better tailor their advice and products to clients. Robo-advisors can incorporate models that help clients smooth their consumption and saving plans based on estimates of their permanent [income](../i/income.md). This can provide a more [robust](../r/robust.md) and long-term approach to [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) compared to methods that predominantly focus on current [income](../i/income.md) levels.

## Conclusion

The Permanent [Income](../i/income.md) Hypothesis provides a foundational framework for understanding consumer behavior in relation to [income](../i/income.md) changes. By distinguishing between permanent and transitory [income](../i/income.md), the PIH suggests that consumers aim to smooth their consumption over time to maximize [utility](../u/utility.md). While there is empirical support for the theory, it is also evident that real-world deviations exist, necessitating a blended understanding of both rational planning and behavioral factors. As such, the PIH remains a critical yet continually evolving component of economic and [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md).
