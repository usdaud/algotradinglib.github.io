# Price Reversal

A price reversal is a change in direction after a trend or move. It can be short term or long term and is often identified by pattern changes, momentum shifts, or key level breaks.

## Common signals
- Break of a trend line or moving average.
- Reversal candlestick patterns.
- Momentum divergence.
- Failed breakout or breakdown.

## Example
A stock trends upward for weeks, then forms a lower high and breaks a support level. Traders call this a reversal and adjust exposure.

## Practical notes
Reversals are easier to identify after they happen. Risk control is important because early reversal attempts often fail.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Price Reversal and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Price Reversal as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Price Reversal, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Price Reversal. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Price Reversal alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
