# Position Trading

Position trading is a long term trading style that holds positions for weeks, months, or longer. It focuses on larger trends and fundamental themes rather than short term price fluctuations.

## Characteristics
- Longer holding periods and fewer trades.
- Wider stops and larger target ranges.
- Greater reliance on macro and fundamental analysis.

## Example
A trader believes interest rates will fall over the next six months and buys long duration bonds, holding the position through multiple market swings.

## Risks
Position trading can face drawdowns during temporary counter trends. Patience and strong risk management are essential.

## Practical notes
Position traders often scale in and out rather than use single entries and exits.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Position Trading and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Position Trading as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Position Trading, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Position Trading. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Position Trading alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
