# Price Limit

A price limit is a boundary that restricts how far a security or contract can move in a single session. It is often used in futures markets to manage volatility.

## How it works
- Exchanges set upper and lower price limits.
- Trading may be paused if the limit is reached.
- Limits can expand or reset in some markets.

## Example
A futures contract has a daily limit of 5 percent. If the price moves 5 percent from the prior settlement, trading may halt or be restricted at the limit price.

## Practical notes
Price limits can trap positions and increase risk during fast markets. Traders should monitor limit rules for each contract.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Price Limit and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Price Limit as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Price Limit, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Price Limit. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Price Limit alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
