# Position Limit

A position limit is a regulatory or exchange imposed cap on the maximum number of contracts or shares a trader can hold. It is designed to prevent excessive concentration and market manipulation.

## Why it exists
- Protect market integrity.
- Reduce systemic risk from large concentrated positions.
- Prevent corners or squeezes in derivatives markets.

## Example
An exchange sets a position limit of 5,000 futures contracts in a commodity. A trader cannot hold a net position larger than that limit.

## Practical notes
Limits can vary by contract month and by participant category. Traders must monitor net positions across related accounts.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Position Limit and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Position Limit as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Position Limit, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Position Limit. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Position Limit alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
