# Partial Regression

Partial regression, also known as residual regression, is a statistical technique used in multivariate data analysis and [econometrics](../e/econometrics_in_trading.md). It's employed to understand the unique relationship between a dependent variable and one of the [multiple](../m/multiple.md) independent variables while [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the effect of the other variables. This method is particularly useful when one wants to isolate the influence of a single predictor variable on the response variable, adjusting for the other predictors in the model.

### The Concept

The core idea behind partial regression is to partition the variance in the dependent variable and the independent variable of [interest](../i/interest.md) into portions attributable to other predictors. Once this is done, the remaining variance (referred to as residuals) is analyzed to determine the direct relationship between the dependent variable and the predictor of [interest](../i/interest.md).

Let’s consider the [multiple](../m/multiple.md) regression model:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \cdots + \beta_kX_k + \epsilon \]

where \( Y \) is the dependent variable, \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) are the independent variables, \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept, \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_k \) are the coefficients, and \( \epsilon \) is the [error term](../e/error_term.md).

### Steps in Partial Regression

1. **Regression of Y on Other Predictors**: 
    First, regress the dependent variable \( Y \) on all independent variables except the one of [interest](../i/interest.md) (e.g., \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_k \)) and obtain the residuals \( \hat{Y}_{(\sim X_i)} \).

2. **Regression of X on Other Predictors**:
    Next, regress the independent variable of [interest](../i/interest.md) \( X_i \) on all other independent variables and obtain the residuals \( \hat{X}_{i(\sim X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_k)} \).

3. **Regression of Residuals**:
    Regress the residuals \( \hat{Y}_{(\sim X_i)} \) on the residuals \( \hat{X}_{i(\sim X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_k)} \). The coefficient obtained from this regression represents the partial effect of \( X_i \) on \( Y \) while controlling for the other predictors.

### Applications in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or "algotrading," often involves the use of complex statistical and [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) to make trading decisions. Partial regression can be an instrumental technique in this domain for several reasons:

1. **Feature Selection and Importance**:
    When developing [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), it's crucial to determine which features (independent variables, such as [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) scores, etc.) are significant for predicting price movements or other [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md). Partial regression helps in isolating the effect of each feature while controlling for others, thus aiding in feature selection and assessing feature importance.

2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**:
    Understanding the partial relationships between various [market indicators](../m/market_indicators.md) and [asset](../a/asset.md) prices can be vital for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). For example, isolating the effect of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on a [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price while [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for other factors such as [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) can help in better [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment and mitigation.

3. **Model Enhancement**:
    In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) models, particularly those based on [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), partial regression can be used to refine models by identifying and adjusting for [multicollinearity](../m/multicollinearity_in_trading.md) among predictors. This leads to more [robust](../r/robust.md) and reliable [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Practical Implementation

Let's consider a hypothetical scenario in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) where an analyst wants to study the effect of a specific [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) (let’s say [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate) on the stock price of a particular company, while [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for other variables such as [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, GDP growth rate, and [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md).

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Collection**:
    Collect historical data on the stock price (dependent variable) and the [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) (independent variables).

2. **Initial Regression**:
    Regress the stock price on all independent variables except the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate:
    
    \[ \text{Stock Price} = \alpha + \beta_1\text{[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md)} + \beta_2\text{GDP Growth} + \beta_3\text{[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)} + \epsilon \]
    
    Obtain the residuals \( \hat{\text{Stock Price}}_{(\sim \text{[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Rate})} \).

3. **Secondary Regression**:
    Regress the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate on the other independent variables:
    
    \[ \text{Inflation Rate} = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2\text{[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md)} + \gamma_3\text{GDP Growth} + \gamma_4\text{[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)} + \nu \]
    
    Obtain the residuals \( \hat{\text{[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Rate}}_{(\sim \text{[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md)}, \text{GDP Growth}, \text{[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)})} \).

4. **Final Regression**:
    Regress the residuals \( \hat{\text{Stock Price}}_{(\sim \text{[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Rate})} \) on the residuals \( \hat{\text{[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Rate}}_{(\sim \text{[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md)}, \text{GDP Growth}, \text{[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)})} \):
    
    \[ \hat{\text{Stock Price}}_{(\sim \text{Inflation Rate})} = \delta_1 + \delta_2\hat{\text{Inflation Rate}}_{(\sim \text{[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md)}, \text{GDP Growth}, \text{[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)})} + \epsilon \]

    The coefficient \( \delta_2 \) [will](../w/will.md) provide the partial effect of the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate on the stock price, controlling for the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), GDP growth, and [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md).

### Software Implementation

Several statistical software and programming languages support the implementation of partial regression, including R, Python, and SAS. Here’s a brief example of how it can be done in Python using the `statsmodels` library:

```python
[import](../i/import.md) statsmodels.api as sm
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

# Example data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Stock_Price': [100, 102, 105, 107, 110],
    'Interest_Rate': [2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4],
    'GDP_Growth': [1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9],
    '[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)': [5, 4.9, 4.8, 4.7, 4.6],
    'Inflation_Rate': [1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6]
})

# Regress Stock Price on Interest Rate, GDP Growth, and Unemployment
model1 = sm.OLS(data['Stock_Price'], sm.add_constant(data[['Interest_Rate', 'GDP_Growth', '[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)']])).fit()
residual_stock_price = model1.resid

# Regress Inflation Rate on Interest Rate, GDP Growth, and Unemployment
model2 = sm.OLS(data['Inflation_Rate'], sm.add_constant(data[['Interest_Rate', 'GDP_Growth', '[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)']])).fit()
residual_inflation_rate = model2.resid

# Regress residual Stock Price on residual Inflation Rate
partial_model = sm.OLS(residual_stock_price, sm.add_constant(residual_inflation_rate)).fit()

print(partial_model.summary())
```

In this example, we first regress the stock price on all predictors except the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate and then regress the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate on the other predictors. The residuals from these regressions are then used to determine the partial effect of the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate on the stock price.

### Companies using Partial Regression in Trading
