# Property Management

Property management is the operation, control, and oversight of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) as used in its most broad terms. Management indicates a need to be cared for, monitored, and accountability given for its usable life and condition. This is much akin to the role of management in any [business](../b/business.md).

## Understanding Property Management

Property management encompasses the administration of residential, commercial, and industrial [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). This can include apartments, detached houses, condominium units, and shopping centers. [Investing](../i/investing.md) in a brick-and-mortar [asset](../a/asset.md) often means committing to the maintenance and care involved in managing that property. Property managers act on behalf of the owner to preserve the [value](../v/value.md) of the property while generating [income](../i/income.md).

The function and [scope](../s/scope.md) of property management include managing tenants, collecting rent, handling maintenance requests, overseeing repairs, and confronting problematic tenants. A property manager can be an individual or a [firm](../f/firm.md) that works directly with buildings and residents.

## Key Responsibilities

### Tenant Management

Managing tenants is one of the core parts of property management. This includes finding and screening tenants, setting up lease agreements, collecting rent, handling tenant inquiries and complaints, and addressing any conflicts that arise.

### Lease Administration

Lease administration involves managing the terms of leases, ensuring compliance with lease terms, and addressing lease renewals and terminations. Property managers need to understand lease agreements, negotiate terms, and ensure they align with regulatory requirements.

### Maintenance and Repairs

Maintaining the property in a safe and habitable condition is a critical responsibility. This includes routine maintenance, emergency repairs, and periodic renovations or upgrades.

They also ensure that property [taxes](../t/taxes.md), [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and other financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) are met.

### Legal Compliance

Property managers must ensure that the property complies with local, state, and federal regulations. This includes adherence to building codes, health and safety requirements, and [landlord](../l/landlord.md)-tenant laws. They must stay up-to-date with any changes in legislation that may impact the property.

### Marketing and Advertising

Property management involves [marketing](../m/marketing.md) the property to potential tenants. This can include advertising through various channels, conducting property showings, and utilizing [digital marketing](../d/digital_marketing.md) strategies to reach a wider audience.

## Types of Property Management
