# Per Stirpes

Per stirpes is a legal term of Latin origin used in the context of [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) and inheritance [distribution](../d/distribution.md). It directly translates to "by roots" or "by branch," and it establishes how a deceased person's [estate](../e/estate.md) is divided among their descendants. Specifically, per stirpes indicates that if a [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) predeceases the testator (the person who made the [will](../w/will.md)), their share of the inheritance automatically passes to their descendants.

In the realm of trading and [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly in [wealth management](../w/wealth_management.md) and [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md), understanding the term per stirpes is vital for professionals advising clients on how to structure the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of their assets. This ensures that a client's [wealth](../w/wealth.md) is allocated according to their wishes, even if unforeseen circumstances arise.

## Mechanics of Per Stirpes Distribution

To understand how per stirpes operates, consider the following example: Assume an individual named John has three children - Alice, Bob, and Carol. According to John's [will](../w/will.md), his [estate](../e/estate.md) is to be split equally among his three children. Unfortunately, Bob predeceases John, but he has two children of his own. Under the per stirpes rule, Bob's share of John's [estate](../e/estate.md) [will](../w/will.md) be divided equally between Bob's two children. Therefore, Alice and Carol each receive one-third of the [estate](../e/estate.md), while Bob's two children each get one-sixth of the [estate](../e/estate.md).

### Diagram for Better Understanding
Here is a visual representation of how per stirpes works:

```
       John
      /  |   \
Alice  Bob  Carol
          / \
    Child 1 Child 2
```
If John passes away, the [estate](../e/estate.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) under the per stirpes rule looks like this:
```
- Alice: 1/3
- Carol: 1/3
- Child 1 (Bob's [heir](../h/heir.md)): 1/6
- Child 2 (Bob's [heir](../h/heir.md)): 1/6
```

## Comparison with Per Capita Distribution

Per stirpes [distribution](../d/distribution.md) contrasts with [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md), which divides the [estate](../e/estate.md) equally among all surviving descendants at the same generational level. In a [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) system, if one of the beneficiaries was deceased, the [estate](../e/estate.md) would not pass down to the descendants of the deceased [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md). Instead, the remaining living beneficiaries would divide the [estate](../e/estate.md) equally among themselves.

Using the previous example under a [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md):

```
- Alice: 1/2
- Carol: 1/2
```
Bob's children would not inherit because the [estate](../e/estate.md) is redistributed only among the surviving heirs at the same generational level.

## Legal Considerations and Jurisdictions

Laws governing inheritance can vary significantly across different jurisdictions. Some states or countries may favor per stirpes methods, while others might implement [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) by [default](../d/default.md). Therefore, it’s crucial for individuals to clearly specify in their wills how they want their [estate](../e/estate.md) to be distributed to avoid any legal disputes or unintended consequences.

Most jurisdictions recognize per stirpes because it ensures a more predictable and equitable [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of assets among family members, especially when dealing with multi-generational estates. For example, in the United States, many states abide by the Uniform [Probate](../p/probate.md) Code (UPC), which defaultly applies the per stirpes method unless otherwise specified.

## Importance in Estate Planning and Wealth Management

From a [wealth management](../w/wealth_management.md) perspective, setting up a per stirpes [distribution](../d/distribution.md) can be beneficial in several ways:

### 1. Family Fairness:
Ensures that each branch of the family receives an equal portion of the [estate](../e/estate.md), maintaining fairness among descendants.
### 2. Predictability:
Provides a clear and predictable method for distributing assets, which can simplify planning and reduce the potential for disputes.
### 3. Multi-Generational Planning:
Ideal for larger families with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) generations, as it automatically takes care of contingencies involving pre-deceased beneficiaries.

## Drafting a Will with Per Stirpes Designation

When drafting a [will](../w/will.md), clarity is crucial. Beneficiaries need to be specified explicitly, and the term "per stirpes" should be used in the correct legal context. For example:

"I leave 50% of my [estate](../e/estate.md) to my son, Bob, and 50% to my daughter, Carol, per stirpes."

Such precise wording ensures that the testator’s intentions are clear and enforceable. A [probate](../p/probate.md) attorney or an [estate](../e/estate.md) planner can provide [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on the correct terminology and structure for including per stirpes [distribution](../d/distribution.md) in a [will](../w/will.md).

## Financial Implications and Tax Considerations

While per stirpes deals primarily with the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) method, it can also affect the financial implications for beneficiaries, including tax liabilities. Different jurisdictions may have varying rules on [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), inheritance [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and how these are calculated for direct descendants versus more distant relatives.

### 1. Estate Taxes:
May apply to the total [value](../v/value.md) of the [estate](../e/estate.md) before [distribution](../d/distribution.md). Understanding per stirpes helps in planning to minimize [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
### 2. Inheritance Taxes:
Beneficiaries may owe [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the property received. Per stirpes can affect the tax calculations if the inheritance is divided among more people.
### 3. Gift Taxes:
In cases where a [trust](../t/trust.md) is used, and distributions are made during the testator's lifetime, know the potential impacts on gift [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Practical Examples and Case Studies

To understand the importance of per stirpes, let us examine some practical scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Simple Family Structure
Consider an [estate](../e/estate.md) plan that involves a straightforward family structure:
- Testator: Jane
- Children: Emily and Thomas
- Grandchildren (Thomas's children): Andrew and Sarah

Jane's [will](../w/will.md) states:
"I bequeath my [estate](../e/estate.md) to my children, Emily and Thomas, per stirpes."

If Thomas predeceases Jane, Andrew and Sarah [will](../w/will.md) inherit their father's share equally.

### Scenario 2: Blended Family
Blended families can make per stirpes designation slightly more complex:
- Testator: Alan
- Children from the first marriage: John and Lisa
- Children from the second marriage: Mark and Alice

Alan’s [will](../w/will.md) specifies:
"I leave my [estate](../e/estate.md) to my children, John, Lisa, Mark, and Alice, per stirpes."

If John predeceases Alan, his share would be divided equally among his own children.

## Conclusion

Per stirpes is a critical concept in the [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) and inheritance domain that ensures a logical and fair [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of assets among descendants. By understanding its implications and mechanics, individuals and financial advisors can better prepare for the future, honoring the testator’s wishes and maintaining family harmony. Proper legal advice and explicitly detailed wills are vital to effectively implementing per stirpes in [estate](../e/estate.md) plans. With a thorough understanding and correct application, per stirpes can serve as an essential tool in achieving equitable [wealth](../w/wealth.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) across generations.
