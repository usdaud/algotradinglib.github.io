# Price Floor

A price floor is a minimum price level set by regulation, policy, or market structure. It prevents prices from falling below a certain point and is used in some regulated markets.

## Examples
- Minimum price rules for short sales.
- Government imposed minimum prices for agricultural products.
- Exchange rules that define minimum tick sizes.

## Impact
Price floors can stabilize markets but can also create excess supply if they are set above market clearing levels.

## Example
A commodity support program sets a minimum price for a crop. If market prices fall below that level, the program intervenes to support the price.

## Practical notes
Traders should understand how price floor policies affect liquidity, volatility, and market incentives.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Price Floor and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Price Floor as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Price Floor, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Price Floor. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Price Floor alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
