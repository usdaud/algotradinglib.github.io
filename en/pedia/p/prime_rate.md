# Prime Rate

The prime rate, often referred to simply as the prime, is an important economic [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) in the banking and financial industries. It is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that commercial banks charge their most creditworthy customers, typically large corporations. The prime rate is pivotal because it acts as a reference point for various [interest](../i/interest.md) rates including those for loans, mortgages, and [credit](../c/credit.md) cards. Understanding the prime rate is crucial not only for financial professionals but also for borrowers and investors.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## Origin and Determination of the Prime Rate

The prime rate is not set by the Federal Reserve (Fed) directly, but there is a strong [correlation](../c/correlation.md) between the prime rate and the Federal Reserve's [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md). The [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which banks lend to each other overnight and serves as the foundation for other [interest](../i/interest.md) rates in the [economy](../e/economy.md). Generally, the prime rate is determined by banks based on the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) plus a [margin](../m/margin.md).

For instance, if the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) is 2%, a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s prime rate might be 4.25% — the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) plus a 2.25% [margin](../m/margin.md). Major banks typically move their prime rates in tandem with each other and changes in the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md). In the United States, the [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md) publishes a consensus prime rate based on the prime rates declared by the largest banks.

## Prime Rate and Its Economic Importance

The prime rate has extensive implications across the spectrum of financial products. For example:

- **Loans and Mortgages**: Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and personal loans might be tied to the prime rate. If the prime rate increases, the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on these loans can also increase, thereby affecting monthly payments for borrowers.
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Cards**: Many [credit](../c/credit.md) cards have variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates that are often pegged to the prime rate. When the prime rate rises, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on these cards also climb, increasing the cost of carrying a balance.
- **[Business](../b/business.md) Loans**: Small and large businesses that rely on loans might see their [interest](../i/interest.md) expenses rise as the prime rate increases, impacting their [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) and profitability.

## Historical Trends and Influences

The prime rate has fluctuated significantly over the decades in response to [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) changes. For instance, during the high [inflation](../i/inflation.md) period of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the prime rate soared to extremely high levels, surpassing 20%. In contrast, during periods of economic downturns such as the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008, the prime rate has fallen to historically low levels to stimulate borrowing and investment.

[Key economic indicators](../k/key_economic_indicators.md) such as [inflation](../i/inflation.md), employment data, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and overall economic stability heavily influence the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) and, consequently, the prime rate. Central banks manipulate the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) to either curb [inflation](../i/inflation.md) or to stimulate [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), thereby indirectly affecting the prime rate.

## Impact on Different Economic Players

### Borrowers:

Borrowers are directly affected by changes in the prime rate. For instance, individuals with variable-rate loans or lines of [credit](../c/credit.md) may find their [interest](../i/interest.md) payments increasing as the prime rate rises. This can affect household budgets and spending patterns.

### Investors:

Investors in fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities such as bonds are also impacted. As the prime rate increases, newly issued bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, making older bonds with lower rates less attractive. This can result in a decrease in the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of existing bonds.

### Businesses:

Businesses with outstanding variable-rate [debt](../d/debt.md) tied to the prime rate would face increased [interest](../i/interest.md) payments if the prime rate rises. Additionally, the cost of new borrowing would become more expensive, which could deter investment and [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

## Prime Rate vs. Other Interest Rates

While the prime rate is closely watched, it's different from the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), Treasury rates, and LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). Each of these rates serves different purposes and markets:

- **[Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md)**: The rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. It influences but does not dictate the prime rate.
- **Treasury Rates**: Yields on U.S. government [debt](../d/debt.md) securities. They are considered [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rates and influence long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- **LIBOR**: An international [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate that some banks charge each other for short-term loans. It is used to price various financial products and differs from the prime rate, which is more domestically focused.

## Prime Rate and Risk Management

Financial institutions manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with changes in the prime rate through various [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md), often using [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments like [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md). By doing so, they can stabilize their [income](../i/income.md) and protect against adverse movements in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. This [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is vital for maintaining financial stability and profitability.

## Future Outlook and Considerations

The future trajectory of the prime rate [will](../w/will.md) largely depend on the macroeconomic environment and the policies of central banks. Factors such as digital advancements, changes in monetary policies, global [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), and unforeseen financial crises could heavily influence the prime rate.

For instance, in a low-[interest](../i/interest.md)-rate environment, central banks might find it challenging to stimulate the [economy](../e/economy.md) through traditional measures, potentially leading to unconventional monetary policies. Conversely, an inflationary environment could prompt central banks to hike rates more aggressively, impacting the prime rate.

## Conclusion

In summary, the prime rate is a fundamental [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) in the financial world. It influences a wide array of financial products and has significant implications for borrowers, investors, and businesses. Understanding how the prime rate is determined, its historical trends, and its broader economic impacts is essential for making informed financial decisions.
