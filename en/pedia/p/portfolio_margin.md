# Portfolio Margin

Portfolio margin is a risk based margin system that calculates requirements based on the overall risk of a portfolio rather than fixed position by position rules. It can reduce margin requirements for diversified or hedged portfolios.

## How it works
- The broker applies stress tests to the portfolio under different market scenarios.
- Margin is based on the worst case loss across those scenarios.
- Offsetting positions can reduce required margin.

## Example
A trader holds a diversified options portfolio with hedged positions. Under portfolio margin, the required collateral may be lower than under standard regulation margin rules.

## Benefits and risks
Portfolio margin can free capital, but it can also allow higher leverage. During volatility spikes, required margin can rise quickly, forcing deleveraging.

## Practical notes
Not all accounts qualify. Brokers often require minimum equity and experience levels.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Portfolio Margin and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Portfolio Margin as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Portfolio Margin, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Portfolio Margin. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Portfolio Margin alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
