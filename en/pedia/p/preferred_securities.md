# Preferred Securities

Preferred securities, often referred to as [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md), represent a hybrid [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that combines features of both [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md). These securities are issued by corporations and are presented to investors as a means of raising [capital](../c/capital.md). The concept of preferred securities embodies various elements that make them distinct and particularly attractive to certain types of investors, predominantly those seeking steady [income](../i/income.md) and relative safety. This comprehensive examination delves into the intricacies of preferred securities, their characteristics, types, advantages, disadvantages, and their role in the broader financial ecosystem.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## Characteristics of Preferred Securities

Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) have unique attributes that differentiate them from common [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds. Key characteristics include:

1. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Priority**: Preferred shareholders receive dividends before common shareholders. These dividends are generally fixed and are paid at regular intervals, making preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) attractive to [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.

2. **Fixed Dividends**: Unlike [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) dividends, which can fluctuate based on the company's profitability, [preferred stock dividends](../p/preferred_stock_dividends.md) are typically fixed. This makes them similar to [bond](../b/bond.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.

3. **[Par Value](../p/par_value.md)**: Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) are issued with a [par value](../p/par_value.md), which is the amount the [investor](../i/investor.md) receives in the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md). This [par value](../p/par_value.md) plays a crucial role in determining the fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md).

4. **Conversion Privileges**: Some preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) come with an option to convert them into a specified number of common [shares](../s/shares.md). This feature adds a potential [upside](../u/upside.md) for preferred stockholders if the company's [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) performs well.

5. **Callability**: Companies often retain the right to call, or redeem, the [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) at a predetermined price after a certain date. This allows the company to potentially repurchase the stock if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates decline.

6. **Voting Rights**: Preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights, which is a key difference from common stockholders. However, certain preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) may [grant](../g/grant.md) voting rights under specific conditions, like if dividends have been missed.

## Types of Preferred Securities

Preferred securities come in various types, each designed to meet specific needs and preferences of both the issuing corporations and the investors. These include:

### 1. **Cumulative Preferred Stock**
Cumulative preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) ensure that if a company misses a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), it must pay the missed dividends in the future before any [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) dividends can be distributed. This feature provides an additional layer of protection for investors.

### 2. **Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock**
Non-cumulative preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) do not accumulate unpaid dividends. If a company decides not to pay a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) in any given period, investors do not have the right to claim these unpaid dividends in the future.

### 3. **Participating Preferred Stock**
Participating preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) investors the opportunity to receive extra dividends if the company achieves certain financial targets or if the dividends paid to common shareholders exceed a specified amount.

### 4. **Convertible Preferred Stock**
Convertible preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) provide the option to convert the preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) into a predetermined number of common [shares](../s/shares.md). This feature can be advantageous during times of [robust](../r/robust.md) [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) performance.

### 5. **Perpetual Preferred Stock**
Perpetual preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) have no [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), meaning they can potentially pay dividends indefinitely, provided the company remains solvent and continues its operations.

### 6. **Adjustable-Rate Preferred Stock**
Adjustable-rate preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) have dividends that adjust periodically based on a predetermined [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) (such as LIBOR). This feature is beneficial for investors in fluctuating [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environments.

## Advantages of Preferred Securities

Preferred securities [offer](../o/offer.md) several benefits that make them appealing to a [range](../r/range.md) of investors, particularly those seeking stable [income](../i/income.md) with a lower [risk](../r/risk.md) profile compared to common [stocks](../s/stock.md). Key advantages include:

### 1. **Fixed Dividends**
The fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments provide a predictable [income](../i/income.md) stream, which is appealing to retirees and other investors who prioritize consistent [income](../i/income.md).

### 2. **Priority Over Common Stock in Liquidation**
In the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), preferred shareholders are paid before common shareholders. This higher claim on assets adds a layer of [security](../s/security.md) to the investment.

### 3. **Less Volatile**
Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) are generally less volatile than common [stocks](../s/stock.md) since their [value](../v/value.md) is more closely tied to [interest](../i/interest.md) rates than to the daily fluctuations of the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

### 4. **Tax Advantages**
In many jurisdictions, dividends received from preferred securities may be taxed at a lower rate than [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) from bonds, providing a tax advantage for investors.

### 5. **Conversion Potential**
Convertible preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for significant [upside](../u/upside.md) if the company’s [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) performs well, providing a blend of [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) with [equity](../e/equity.md) appreciation potential.

## Disadvantages of Preferred Securities

Despite their advantages, preferred securities also come with certain drawbacks that prospective investors should consider:

### 1. **Interest Rate Sensitivity**
Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) are highly sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes. If [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [value](../v/value.md) of existing preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) generally falls, as newer issues come to [market](../m/market.md) with higher yields.

### 2. **Credit Risk**
Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) carry [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), meaning if the issuing company faces financial difficulties, it may suspend [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments altogether.

### 3. **Lack of Voting Rights**
Preferred shareholders usually do not have voting rights, limiting their influence over [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and significant company decisions.

### 4. **Limited Capital Appreciation**
Unlike common [stocks](../s/stock.md), preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) typically [offer](../o/offer.md) limited [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation. Investors may miss out on substantial gains if the company's stock price increases significantly.

### 5. **Call Risk**
If the [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) is callable, the issuing company can redeem the [shares](../s/shares.md) if it becomes advantageous to do so, potentially at a lower [return](../r/return.md) for the [investor](../i/investor.md).

## Preferred Securities in the Market

Several companies and financial institutions utilize preferred securities as part of their [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md). They often appeal to both institutional and individual investors looking for consistent [income](../i/income.md) with less [volatility](../v/volatility.md) compared to common [stocks](../s/stock.md). The following examples highlight the issuance and management of preferred securities in the [market](../m/market.md).

### Wells Fargo & Company
Wells Fargo, a major American financial services company, regularly issues [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) as part of its [capital](../c/capital.md) management strategy. These offerings allow the [bank](../b/bank.md) to maintain a balanced [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) while providing attractive investment opportunities to [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.


### Bank of America Corporation
[Bank](../b/bank.md) of America, another leading global financial institution, also issues preferred securities to enhance its [capital](../c/capital.md) base and support its lending and investment activities. These securities [offer](../o/offer.md) competitive dividends to attract a broad [range](../r/range.md) of investors.


### AT&T Inc.
Telecommunications giant AT&T Inc. issues various preferred securities to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) for its expansive operations. These securities play a crucial role in funding the company's [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) and technological advancements.


## Conclusion

Preferred securities represent a significant category within the [capital](../c/capital.md) [market](../m/market.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a blend of attributes from both [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) instruments. Their unique characteristics, including fixed dividends, priority in [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), and potential conversion privileges, make them attractive to a certain segment of investors. However, they also pose risks such as [interest rate sensitivity](../i/interest_rate_sensitivity.md) and [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) that investors must carefully consider.

As financial instruments, preferred securities serve essential roles for both issuing entities and investors. Companies [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) to optimize their [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) and [fund](../f/fund.md) operations, while investors benefit from relatively stable [income](../i/income.md) streams and priority in [asset](../a/asset.md) claims. Through careful analysis and consideration of their attributes and [market](../m/market.md) conditions, investors can effectively incorporate preferred securities into their investment portfolios, achieving a balance of [income](../i/income.md) and relative safety.

Whether utilized by leading financial institutions like Wells Fargo and [Bank](../b/bank.md) of America or major corporations like AT&T, preferred securities remain a versatile and valuable component of the broader financial ecosystem, reflecting the diverse needs and strategies of both issuers and investors.
