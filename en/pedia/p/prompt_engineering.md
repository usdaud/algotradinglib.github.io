# Prompt Engineering

Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts to guide [large language models](../l/large_language_models.md) (LLMs) in generating desired outputs, improving both accuracy and relevance.

### Key Components
- **Task Specification:** Clearly defining what the model should do.
- **Context [Provision](../p/provision.md):** Supplying relevant background information or examples.
- **Instruction Clarity:** Using precise language and structure to minimize ambiguity.
- **Iteration and Testing:** Experimenting with different prompts to optimize performance.

### Applications
- **Chatbots:** Crafting prompts that lead to more natural and helpful conversations.
- **Content Generation:** Guiding models to produce creative or technical content.
- **Question Answering:** Formulating queries that result in accurate and detailed responses.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Enhancing model performance on specific tasks through carefully engineered prompts.

### Advantages
- Significant improvements in model output quality with minimal changes.
- Reduces the need for extensive fine-tuning.
- Enables more controllable and predictable responses.

### Challenges
- Requires expertise and experimentation to design effective prompts.
- Subtle variations in phrasing can lead to drastically different outputs.
- Often a trial-and-error process that can be time-consuming.

### Future Outlook
Prompt engineering [will](../w/will.md) likely evolve into more systematic, automated approaches, integrating [feedback loops](../f/feedback_loops_in_trading.md) and user interactions to continuously optimize model performance.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Prompt Engineering and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Prompt Engineering as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Prompt Engineering, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Prompt Engineering. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Prompt Engineering alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
