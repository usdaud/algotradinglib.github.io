# Preferred Dividend

Preferred dividends refer to dividends that are paid on [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md), a class of ownership in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) that has a higher claim on its assets and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) compared to [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). Preferred dividends are typically fixed and are prioritized over [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) dividends, meaning they must be paid out before common stockholders receive any dividends.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

[Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md), also known as [preference shares](../p/preference_shares.md), combines features of both [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments. Like [common stock](../c/common_stock.md), [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) represents a share of ownership in the company. However, similar to bonds, [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) usually does not come with voting rights but promises a fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md), which makes it attractive to [income](../i/income.md)-seeking investors.

## Characteristics of Preferred Stock

Preferred stockholders have several characteristics that distinguish their [shares](../s/shares.md) from common [shares](../s/shares.md):

1. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Priority**: Preferred dividends must be paid before any dividends can be paid to common shareholders. If a company is unable to pay all of its dividends, it must pay preferred shareholders first.
2. **Fixed Dividends**: The dividends on [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) are typically set at a fixed rate, which is specified at the time of issuance.
3. **Cumulative Dividends**: Many preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) come with a cumulative [dividend](../d/dividend.md) feature. This means that if the company misses a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), it must pay the missed dividends in the future before any dividends can be distributed to common shareholders.
4. **Convertibility**: Some preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) are convertible, meaning they can be converted into a predetermined number of common [shares](../s/shares.md) under certain conditions.
5. **Callability**: [Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) may be callable, meaning the company has the right to repurchase the stock at a specified price after a defined date.
6. **No Voting Rights**: Preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights in the company, although some preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) may provide limited voting rights in certain circumstances.

## Types of Preferred Stock

[Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) can come in various forms, each with unique features tailored to specific [investor](../i/investor.md) needs:

1. **Cumulative [Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)**: This type ensures that if a company skips a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), the owed payments accumulate and must be paid out before any [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) dividends.
2. **Non-Cumulative [Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)**: This type does not have the cumulative feature, meaning skipped dividends do not accumulate.
3. **[Participating Preferred Stock](../p/participating_preferred_stock.md)**: These [shares](../s/shares.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) preferred shareholders the right to receive extra dividends if the company achieves certain financial goals.
4. **[Convertible Preferred Stock](../c/convertible_preferred_stock.md)**: These can be converted into common [shares](../s/shares.md) based on predetermined conditions, spanning a set period or under specific scenarios.
5. **Perpetual [Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)**: Perpetual preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) have no [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), which means they provide dividends indefinitely, representing a perpetual [income](../i/income.md) stream.
6. **Adjustable-Rate [Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)**: Dividends on adjustable-rate [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) vary and are tied to an external [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), such as LIBOR, resulting in varying [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [income](../i/income.md).

## Calculation of Preferred Dividends

The calculation of preferred dividends is straightforward. It typically involves multiplying the fixed [dividend rate](../d/dividend_rate.md) by the [par value](../p/par_value.md) of the [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md).

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Preferred Dividend} = \text{[Dividend Rate](../d/dividend_rate.md)} \times \text{[Par Value](../p/par_value.md)} \]

For example, if a company issues [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) with a $100 [par value](../p/par_value.md) and a 5% [dividend rate](../d/dividend_rate.md), the annual [dividend](../d/dividend.md) per share would be:
\[ \text{Preferred [Dividend](../d/dividend.md)} = 0.05 \times 100 = \$5 \]

## Financial Impact of Preferred Dividends

Preferred dividends impact a company's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) in several ways:

1. **[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md)**: Dividends are not considered an [expense](../e/expense.md) and do not directly reduce net [income](../i/income.md). Instead, they are deducted from net [income](../i/income.md) to determine the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) available to common shareholders.
2. **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md)**: [Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) appears in the [equity](../e/equity.md) section of the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), and unpaid cumulative dividends are often [listed](../l/listed.md) as a [liability](../l/liability.md) under "dividends payable."

## Issuance and Investment Considerations

### For Companies

Companies might choose to [issue](../i/issue.md) [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) for several reasons:

1. **Access to [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: [Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) can provide access to [capital](../c/capital.md) without diluting common [equity](../e/equity.md) or incurring additional [debt](../d/debt.md).
2. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Flexibility**: Unlike [debt](../d/debt.md), where [interest](../i/interest.md) payments are mandatory, preferred dividends can be deferred in tough economic times (if cumulative), providing [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) flexibility.
3. **Attractive [Financing](../f/financing.md) Option**: For highly leveraged companies, [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) can be an attractive [financing](../f/financing.md) option as it does not increase [debt](../d/debt.md) ratios.

### For Investors

Investors consider [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) for:

1. **Stable [Income](../i/income.md)**: The fixed dividends [offer](../o/offer.md) a stable [income](../i/income.md) stream, making preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) attractive to retirees and [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.
2. **Priority Over [Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md)**: In the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), preferred shareholders have a higher claim on assets compared to common shareholders.
3. **Less [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) generally exhibit less price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) than common [stocks](../s/stock.md), providing a relatively safer [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md).

## Risks and Downsides

Despite their benefits, preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) come with several risks and downsides:

1. **[Interest Rate Sensitivity](../i/interest_rate_sensitivity.md)**: [Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) prices are highly sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes. When rates rise, prices typically fall.
2. **Limited [Upside Potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md)**: Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) tend to [offer](../o/offer.md) limited [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation potential compared to common [stocks](../s/stock.md).
3. **No Voting Rights**: Lack of voting rights means preferred shareholders have less influence over corporate decisions.
4. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: [Credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) exists if the issuing company faces financial difficulties and cannot pay dividends.

## Real-World Examples

For instance, in their stock structure, they have issued several series of [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md). The prospectuses and detailed information about those offerings can be found directly on Bank of America's company filings.

### General Electric (GE)

GE has also issued various series of [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). The details about their [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) offerings, including terms and conditions, are available on GE's

## Conclusion

Preferred dividends are a key feature of [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md), providing a steady and predictable [income](../i/income.md) stream for investors. Understanding the nuances and characteristics of [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) is vital for both investors and issuing companies to make informed decisions aligning with their financial goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md). Investors should weigh the benefits of stable [income](../i/income.md) and [dividend](../d/dividend.md) priority against the risks of [interest rate sensitivity](../i/interest_rate_sensitivity.md), limited [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md), and lack of voting rights before [investing](../i/investing.md) in preferred [shares](../s/shares.md).
