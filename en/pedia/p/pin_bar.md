# Pin Bar

A pin bar is a candlestick pattern with a long wick and a small body near one end of the candle. It represents a strong rejection of a price level and is often used as a reversal signal.

## Structure
- A long tail or wick showing rejection.
- A small body near the opposite end.
- The long wick is typically at least two thirds of the total range.

## Interpretation
A bullish pin bar has a long lower wick and a small body near the high, signaling rejection of lower prices. A bearish pin bar has a long upper wick and a small body near the low, signaling rejection of higher prices.

## Example
Price drops below support intraday but closes near the high with a long lower wick. Traders view the pin bar as evidence of buying pressure.

## Practical notes
Pin bars work best at key levels and in the direction of the higher timeframe trend.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Pin Bar and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Pin Bar as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Pin Bar, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Pin Bar. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Pin Bar alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
