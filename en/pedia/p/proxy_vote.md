# Proxy Vote

A [proxy](../p/proxy.md) vote is a ballot cast by one person or [firm](../f/firm.md) on behalf of a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) of a [corporation](../c/corporation.md). Shareholders have a right to vote on matters of corporate policy, including decisions on the makeup of the board of directors, mergers, acquisitions, and executive compensation. When the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) is unable to attend the meeting to vote, they may elect to vote by [proxy](../p/proxy.md). This practice allows them to ensure that their [shares](../s/shares.md) participate in the decision-making process.

## Importance of Proxy Voting

[Proxy](../p/proxy.md) voting plays a crucial role in [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), enabling shareholders to influence and respond to company policies and [leadership](../l/leadership.md). It is particularly important in publicly traded companies, where shareholders are dispersed and direct participation in decision-making would be logistically challenging for many.

### Corporate Governance and Shareholder Influence

[Corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) refers to the system of rules, practices, and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. The primary mechanisms of [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) are the board of directors and shareholders. [Proxy](../p/proxy.md) voting is a vital tool that enables shareholders to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) their rights and responsibilities within this framework.

### Applicable Regulations

The legal framework governing [proxy](../p/proxy.md) voting varies by country but generally includes securities laws and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) regulations. For instance, in the United States, the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) has regulatory authority over [proxy](../p/proxy.md) solicitation under the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md).

#### SEC and Proxy Voting

The SEC requires that public companies provide information to shareholders in the form of [proxy](../p/proxy.md) statements before the annual meeting. These statements [offer](../o/offer.md) detailed information regarding the issues to be voted on, the candidates for the board of directors, and other pertinent information.

## Mechanism of Proxy Voting

### How It Works

A [proxy](../p/proxy.md) vote can be solicited through three primary means: mail, phone, and internet. The [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) can either provide direct voting instructions or [grant](../g/grant.md) the [proxy](../p/proxy.md) the authority to vote at their discretion.

#### Steps in Proxy Voting

1. **[Proxy](../p/proxy.md) Solicitation**: The company or individuals seeking votes send [proxy](../p/proxy.md) statements to shareholders. These documents contain detailed information related to the agenda items scheduled for a vote.
2. **Instruction Receipt**: Shareholders receive the information and determine how they wish to vote on each item.
3. **Voting [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Shareholders submit their votes through their chosen method, often by returning a [proxy](../p/proxy.md) card or entering their choices online.
4. **Count and Certification**: [Proxy](../p/proxy.md) votes are counted and verified by independent inspectors of election, and the votes are officially recorded at the annual meeting.

### Types of Proxy Votes

1. **Directed [Proxy](../p/proxy.md)**: Specifies exactly how the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) wants their [shares](../s/shares.md) voted.
2. **Discretionary [Proxy](../p/proxy.md)**: Authorizes the [proxy](../p/proxy.md) holder to vote as they see fit, often applied in unforeseen circumstances or on issues not covered in the [proxy statement](../p/proxy_statement.md).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Convenience**: Allows shareholders to participate without needing to be physically present at the meeting.
2. **Access to Information**: [Proxy](../p/proxy.md) statements provide comprehensive [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) on the issues to be voted on.
3. **Cost-Effective**: Reduces the logistical and financial burden of attending meetings.

### Disadvantages

1. **Information Overload**: Shareholders might feel overwhelmed by the amount of information in [proxy](../p/proxy.md) statements.
2. **Potential for [Conflict of Interest](../c/conflict_of_interest.md)**: [Proxy](../p/proxy.md) voters may not always act in the best [interest](../i/interest.md) of shareholders.
3. **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md) of Impact**: Individual small shareholders might feel that their vote has little impact.

## Proxy Voting in Institutional Investment

### Role of Institutional Investors

Institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension funds, and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, [hold](../h/hold.md) significant [shares](../s/shares.md) in public companies. Their [proxy](../p/proxy.md) votes can highly influence corporate decisions and directors' selections.

### Stewardship and Fiduciary Responsibility

Institutional investors have a fiduciary duty to vote their proxies in the best interests of their stakeholders. Many set up special departments to [handle](../h/handle.md) [proxy](../p/proxy.md) voting, ensuring diligent and thoughtful participation in [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).

### Proxy Advisory Firms

To aid institutional investors, [proxy](../p/proxy.md) advisory firms provide research, analysis, and voting recommendations. Prominent firms in this space include Institutional [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis.

## Proxy Voting and Activism

### Shareholder Activism

[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activists acquire [shares](../s/shares.md) in companies to influence management and boards toward specific outcomes, ranging from changes in corporate strategy to the adoption of new environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies.

### Proxy Fights

Occasionally, conflicts arise when [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activists attempt to garner support against current management proposals. These [proxy](../p/proxy.md) fights can lead to contested elections, where competing groups solicit votes to prevail in influencing corporate direction.

## Technological Innovations in Proxy Voting

### Online Platforms

The rise of online platforms and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology is poised to revolutionize [proxy](../p/proxy.md) voting by increasing [transparency](../t/transparency.md), reducing costs, and enhancing [security](../s/security.md).

### Blockchain in Proxy Voting

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology offers a decentralized, tamper-resistant way to record votes, which can significantly enhance the accuracy and integrity of [proxy](../p/proxy.md) voting.

**Example**: Broadridge Financial Solutions has been pioneering [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)-based [proxy](../p/proxy.md) voting solutions. For more information, visit Broadridge.

## Conclusion

[Proxy](../p/proxy.md) voting remains an indispensable mechanism through which shareholders can exert their influence on [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md). Despite its challenges, advances in technology and continuous regulatory scrutiny ensure [proxy](../p/proxy.md) voting evolves to meet shareholders' needs in an increasingly complex financial landscape.
