# Positive Volume Index (PVI)

The positive volume index is a momentum indicator that focuses on days when volume increases. It assumes that informed traders are more active on higher volume days.

## Calculation
- If volume is higher than the previous day, update the PVI by the percentage price change.
- If volume is lower, PVI remains unchanged.

## Interpretation
A rising PVI suggests accumulation on higher volume days. Traders often compare the PVI to a moving average to identify trend direction.

## Example
Price rises on days of increasing volume, causing the PVI to trend upward. A trader sees this as confirmation of bullish participation.

## Practical notes
PVI is usually paired with the negative volume index for a more complete view of volume behavior.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Positive Volume Index (PVI) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Positive Volume Index (PVI) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Positive Volume Index (PVI), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Positive Volume Index (PVI). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Positive Volume Index (PVI) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
