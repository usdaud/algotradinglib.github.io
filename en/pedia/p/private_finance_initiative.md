# Private Finance Initiative (PFI)

## Introduction
The Private [Finance](../f/finance.md) Initiative (PFI) is a form of public-private partnership (PPP) used primarily in the United Kingdom to deliver public [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects. Through PFI, the [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) is contracted to design, build, [finance](../f/finance.md), and manage public facilities and services, with the public sector making payments over the life of the contract, typically 25-30 years. This approach aims to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) efficiencies and expertise to deliver public services more cost-effectively.

## History and Development
The PFI concept was first introduced in the UK in 1992 by the Conservative government under John Major, aiming to reduce public spending on [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) while leveraging the expertise and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the [private sector](../p/private_sector.md). The initiative continued under the subsequent Labour governments, significantly expanding in [scope](../s/scope.md) and application.

Several other countries have adopted similar models, albeit under different names and structures, to address their [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) needs.

### Key Milestones
1. **1992**: PFI introduced in the UK.
2. **Late 1990s - Early 2000s**: [Expansion](../e/expansion.md) under New Labour government, especially in health and education sectors.
3. **2000s**: Criticism and reforms, including the introduction of stricter [value](../v/value.md)-for-[money](../m/money.md) assessments and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) measures.
4. **2010s**: Decline in new PFI deals under Conservative-led coalition and subsequent Conservative governments, replaced by new models like PF2.
5. **2018**: UK Chancellor Philip Hammond announces the end of the PFI and PF2 models for new projects.

## Mechanism and Structure
PFI projects typically involve the following stages:

### Project Identification
Public authorities identify a need for new [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) or services and evaluate the feasibility of using a PFI model compared to traditional public funding.

### Procurement Process
1. **Invitation to [Tender](../t/tender.md)**: Public authority invites bids from [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) consortia to deliver the project.
2. **Competitive Dialogue**: Detailed discussions with shortlisted bidders to refine proposals and ensure [value](../v/value.md) for [money](../m/money.md).
3. **Selection**: Preferred bidder is chosen based on a combination of cost, quality, and [risk](../r/risk.md) transfer criteria.

### Contractual Framework
1. **Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)**: The successful bidder usually forms an SPV, a legal entity created solely for the project, to manage risks and operational responsibilities.
2. **[Financing](../f/financing.md)**: The SPV secures [project finance](../p/project_finance.md), typically a mix of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md), from private investors and financial institutions.
3. **Construction and Operation**: The SPV oversees the construction phase, often subcontracting works to construction firms, and subsequently operates the [facility](../f/facility.md), providing maintenance and associated services as contracted.
4. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Mechanism**: Public authority makes periodic payments (Unitary Charge) to the SPV, covering [financing](../f/financing.md) costs, operational expenses, and [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md).

## Risk Allocation
A critical aspect of PFI is the transfer and management of risks. Common types of risks include:
- **Construction [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Delays or cost overruns during the construction phase.
- **[Operational Risk](../o/operational_risk.md)**: Failure to deliver required service levels.
- **[Demand](../d/demand.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: [Variability](../v/variability.md) in the [facility](../f/facility.md)'s usage levels.
- **[Financial Risk](../f/financial_risk.md)**: Changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates or [financing](../f/financing.md) conditions.

Effective [risk](../r/risk.md) transfer aims to place each [risk](../r/risk.md) with the party best able to manage it, incentivizing [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and cost savings.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
### Advantages
1. **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: [Private sector](../p/private_sector.md) expertise in [project management](../p/project_management.md) and innovation can lead to cost savings and timely delivery.
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Transfer**: Public sector offloads significant construction and operational risks to private entities.
3. **Budgetary Flexibility**: [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) the cost of [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) over the project's life, reducing immediate public expenditure.
4. **Maintenance and Quality**: Incentives for private operators to maintain facilities at high standards due to long-term contracts.

### Disadvantages
1. **Complexity and Cost**: High [transaction](../t/transaction.md) and [financing](../f/financing.md) costs, including legal and advisory fees.
2. **Long-term Commitments**: Binding long-term financial commitments can limit future budgetary flexibility.
3. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md) Issues**: Complexity and confidentiality in contracts can reduce public oversight and accountability.
4. **Mixed Results on [Value](../v/value.md) for [Money](../m/money.md)**: Some projects have faced criticism for not delivering [perceived value](../p/perceived_value.md) or for excessive profits to private investors at [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) [expense](../e/expense.md).

## Case Studies
1. **London Underground PPP**: One of the most notable PFI examples in transport, involving the maintenance and upgrading of the underground network. Faced significant challenges and was ultimately terminated early.
2. **NHS Hospital Projects**: Many NHS hospitals were built under PFI, providing modern facilities but facing scrutiny over long-term costs and financial sustainability.

## Reforms and Alternatives
In response to criticisms, various reforms and alternative models have been proposed and implemented:

### PF2
Introduced in 2012 as a reformed version of PFI, PF2 aimed to address [transparency](../t/transparency.md) issues and improve [value](../v/value.md) for [money](../m/money.md) by:
- Increasing public sector [equity](../e/equity.md) stakes in projects.
- Enhancing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) through [open](../o/open.md) book [accounting](../a/accounting.md).
- Simplifying [procurement](../p/procurement.md) processes.

### Governmental Alternatives
In recent years, alternatives such as public sector [capital](../c/capital.md) borrowing and alternative PPP models have been explored to deliver public [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) without some of PFI’s recognized shortcomings.

## Conclusion
The Private [Finance](../f/finance.md) Initiative represents a significant evolution in public sector [procurement](../p/procurement.md), leveraging [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) capabilities to deliver public [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). While [offering](../o/offering.md) potential benefits in [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), it also presents challenges in complexity and long-term financial impact. Understanding PFI’s mechanisms, advantages, and criticisms is essential for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to address [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) needs sustainably and effectively.
