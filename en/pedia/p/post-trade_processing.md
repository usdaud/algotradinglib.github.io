# Post-Trade Processing

## Introduction

Post-[trade](../t/trade.md) processing is a critical component of the securities trading lifecycle, occurring after a [trade](../t/trade.md) has been executed and involving a series of administrative, operational, and financial tasks required to ensure the accurate and efficient completion of the [trade](../t/trade.md). It encompasses [trade](../t/trade.md) capture, [trade](../t/trade.md) confirmation, allocation, [clearing](../c/clearing.md), settlement, and [reconciliation](../r/reconciliation.md), each playing a vital role in mitigating risks and ensuring compliance within the trading ecosystem.

## Trade Capture

### Definition and Importance

[Trade](../t/trade.md) capture is the initial step in the post-[trade](../t/trade.md) processing sequence, wherein the details of the executed [trade](../t/trade.md) are recorded into the trading system. The primary aim is to create an accurate transactional record that [will](../w/will.md) be used for subsequent post-[trade](../t/trade.md) activities. 

### Key Activities

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Recording**: Capturing the details such as the [security](../s/security.md) type, quantity, price, [trade](../t/trade.md) date, and [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) information.
- **Verification**: Ensuring the captured information matches the [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) report.
- **Storage**: Safely storing the [trade](../t/trade.md) details within the [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) or databases for future reference and processing.

## Trade Confirmation

### Definition and Importance

[Trade](../t/trade.md) confirmation is the process of verifying that both parties involved in the [trade](../t/trade.md) agree on the specific terms and conditions of the executed [trade](../t/trade.md). Accurate confirmations help prevent misunderstandings and disputes between counterparties.

### Key Activities

- **Agreement**: Both the buyer and seller confirm the details of the [trade](../t/trade.md), including the [security](../s/security.md), quantity, and price.
- **Notification**: Notifying the involved parties through [trade](../t/trade.md) confirmation messages, often using standardized communication protocols like SWIFT or FIX.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Handling and resolving any discrepancies or disputes that may arise during the confirmation process.

## Trade Allocation

### Definition and Importance

[Trade](../t/trade.md) allocation involves distributing the executed [trade](../t/trade.md) among various accounts or clients, as specified by the [investment manager](../i/investment_manager.md) or trading entity. This process is crucial for [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) and accurate record-keeping of investment activities for different clients.

### Key Activities

- **Distributing Trades**: Allocating portions of the [trade](../t/trade.md) to different client accounts or sub-accounts as per predefined criteria or instructions.
- **Communication**: Informing custodians, brokers, and other relevant parties about the allocation details.
- **Record Maintenance**: Keeping detailed records of allocations for compliance and audit purposes.

## Clearing

### Definition and Importance

[Clearing](../c/clearing.md) is the process that involves the preparation, validation, and finalization of [trade](../t/trade.md) details before settling the [trade](../t/trade.md). It bridges the gap between [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) and settlement, reducing [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) by ensuring that both the buyer and seller can fulfill their [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Key Activities

- **[Netting](../n/netting.md)**: Offsetting [multiple](../m/multiple.md) trades to minimize the number of securities and funds that need to be transferred.
- **Validation**: Verifying the [trade](../t/trade.md) details and ensuring that funds and securities are available to fulfill the [trade](../t/trade.md).
- **Confirmation**: Communicating with clearinghouses and counterparties to confirm that the [trade](../t/trade.md) can proceed to settlement.

## Settlement

### Definition and Importance

Settlement is the final step in the [trade](../t/trade.md) lifecycle, where the actual transfer of securities and funds between the buyer and seller takes place. Effective settlement mechanisms are crucial for [market](../m/market.md) stability and [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence.

### Key Activities

- **Transfer of Securities**: Delivering the traded securities from the seller to the buyer.
- **Transfer of Funds**: Ensuring the transfer of the agreed-upon [payment](../p/payment.md) from the buyer to the seller.
- **Settlement Systems**: Leveraging settlement systems and platforms to ensure timely and accurate settlement.

## Reconciliation

### Definition and Importance

[Reconciliation](../r/reconciliation.md) involves comparing and matching [trade](../t/trade.md) records across different systems to ensure accuracy and consistency. Regular [reconciliation](../r/reconciliation.md) helps identify and rectify discrepancies, reducing [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md) and maintaining the integrity of the trading process.

### Key Activities

- **Data Comparison**: Matching [trade](../t/trade.md) details from internal systems with those of counterparties, clearinghouses, and custodians.
- **Discrepancy Management**: Identifying, investigating, and resolving any mismatches or discrepancies.
- **Reporting**: Generating [reconciliation](../r/reconciliation.md) reports to document findings and corrective actions.

## Regulatory Compliance

### Importance in Post-Trade Processing

In the realm of post-[trade](../t/trade.md) processing, regulatory compliance is paramount. Compliance with financial regulations ensures [market](../m/market.md) integrity, protects investors, and maintains [transparency](../t/transparency.md). Post-[trade](../t/trade.md) activities are subject to stringent regulations to mitigate risks associated with settlement, reporting, and record-keeping.

### Key Regulations and Standards

- **Dodd-Frank Act**: A U.S. regulation that impacts various aspects of post-[trade](../t/trade.md) processing, including central [clearing](../c/clearing.md) and reporting of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).
- **EMIR (European [Market](../m/market.md) [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) Regulation)**: An EU regulation focusing on the [clearing](../c/clearing.md) and reporting of over-the-counter [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).
- **[MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive)**: An EU directive that addresses [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reporting requirements for [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) and post-[trade](../t/trade.md) processes.

## Risk Management

### Importance in Post-Trade Processing

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is an integral part of post-[trade](../t/trade.md) processing.

### Key Risk Management Strategies

- **[Counterparty Risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) Mitigation**: Use of central counterparties (CCPs) and [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements to reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).
- **[Operational Risk Management](../o/operational_risk_management.md)**: Implementation of [robust](../r/robust.md) systems and processes to [handle](../h/handle.md) errors, system failures, and human mistakes.
- **Settlement [Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation**: Use of delivery versus [payment](../p/payment.md) (DvP) mechanisms to ensure that the transfer of securities occurs only if the [payment](../p/payment.md) is made.
