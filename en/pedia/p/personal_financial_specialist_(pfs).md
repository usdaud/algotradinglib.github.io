# Personal Financial Specialist (PFS)

A Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) is a designation awarded by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to CPAs who have demonstrated their knowledge and experience in personal [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md). The PFS designation represents a CPA’s expertise in areas such as [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md), [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), investments, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md).

## Overview

The financial services [industry](../i/industry.md) has many designations and certifications, but the PFS stands out because it requires the holder to be a licensed Certified Public [Accountant](../a/accountant.md) (CPA) in good standing. This requirement ensures that PFS credential holders possess a high level of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) and tax knowledge, positioned to serve clients comprehensively.

## History of PFS

The PFS designation was introduced by the AICPA in 1987 to address the growing need for [accounting](../a/accounting.md) professionals to provide comprehensive [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) services. This evolution was driven by increasing complexity in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), tax regulations, and the convergence of global economies, all necessitating a higher level of [specialization](../s/specialization.md) in personal [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

## Eligibility and Requirements

To qualify for the PFS designation, candidates must meet several specific criteria:
- **Education and CPA License:** Candidates must [hold](../h/hold.md) a valid CPA license and be a member of the AICPA.
- **Experience:** Candidates need to have at least 3,000 hours of personal [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) [business](../b/business.md) experience or teaching experience over a five-year period concluding with the date of the PFS application.
- **Examinations:** Candidates must pass the PFP (Personal [Financial Planning](../f/financial_planning.md)) exam, unless they qualify for an [exemption](../e/exemption.md) based on other relevant credentials such as the CFP (Certified [Financial Planner](../f/financial_planner.md)).
- **Continuing Professional Education (CPE):** Maintain at least 60 hours of PFP-related CPE every three years as part of the CPA CPE requirement.
