# Horizon Analysis

Horizon analysis is a crucial concept in the realm of [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and investment decision-making. It refers to the evaluation of investment performance over various time horizons, allowing investors, analysts, and financial managers to make informed decisions based on expected returns, risks, and [market](../m/market.md) conditions over different periods. The analysis typically involves assessing the potential outcomes of an investment over short, medium, and long-term horizons to understand its overall viability and profitability.

## Importance of Horizon Analysis

Horizon analysis is fundamental in the field of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (also known as algo-trading), where decisions are frequently driven by [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and sophisticated strategies. In algo-trading, the timing of entry and exit in positions is crucial, and horizon analysis helps in optimizing these decisions by providing insights into the expected performance of trades over varying time frames.

### Benefits in Algorithmic Trading

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: By evaluating investments over different time horizons, traders can better manage [risk](../r/risk.md). Short-term horizons might indicate higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md), while long-term horizons may show more stable trends and potential for growth.
2. **Performance [Optimization](../o/optimization.md)**: Algo-[trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) often rely on [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) that vary with time. Horizon analysis helps in identifying the optimal time frames for strategies to perform best.
3. **[Investment Strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) Tailoring**: It allows for the customization of strategies based on the time horizons that align with investment goals, whether they are short-term gains or long-term [wealth](../w/wealth.md) accumulation.
4. **[Market](../m/market.md) Condition Adaptation**: By analyzing how investments perform over various periods, traders can adjust their strategies to adapt to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Key Components of Horizon Analysis

### 1. Time Horizons
Time horizons in [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) can be segmented into three primary categories:
- **Short-Term**: Typically spans days to a few months.
- **Medium-Term**: Ranges from a few months to a couple of years.
- **Long-Term**: Traditionally extends over several years, potentially decades.

### 2. Expected Returns
Expected returns over different horizons are projected based on historical data, statistical analysis, and algorithmic models. These projections help in understanding the potential profitability of an investment over each [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md).

### 3. Risk Assessment
[Risk](../r/risk.md) is evaluated through metrics such as [volatility](../v/volatility.md), [beta](../b/beta.md), [value](../v/value.md)-at-[risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR), and [scenario analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md). The [risk](../r/risk.md) profile may change significantly with the [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md), necessitating adjustments in strategy.

### 4. Scenario Analysis
[Scenario analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md) involves simulating various [market](../m/market.md) conditions and their impact on investment performance over different horizons. This helps in preparing for adverse events and capitalizing on favorable scenarios.

### 5. Sensitivity Analysis
[Sensitivity analysis](../s/sensitivity_analysis.md) assesses how changes in key variables (such as [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, and [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md)) affect investment returns over time. This understanding is crucial for making [robust](../r/robust.md) investment decisions.
