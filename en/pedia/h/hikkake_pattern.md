# Hikkake Pattern

The Hikkake pattern is a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) chart pattern used by traders to predict potential [market](../m/market.md) reversals or continuation trends. Recognizing this pattern can provide significant insights into price movement and help traders make informed decisions. Let's delve deeper into what the Hikkake pattern is, how to identify it, and how traders can use this pattern to their advantage.

## Understanding the Hikkake Pattern

The Hikkake pattern was first introduced by Daniel L. Chesler, CMT, in the March 2003 [issue](../i/issue.md) of [Technical Analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) of [Stocks](../s/stock.md) & Commodities magazine. The name "Hikkake" comes from the Japanese word "hikake," which means "trick" or "trap," aptly describing the pattern's trapping mechanism, often misleading traders into taking the wrong position before reversing.

The Hikkake pattern is essentially a pattern within a pattern, mimicking a failure in a simpler engulfing pattern or inside bar pattern. It is a [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) pattern that can indicate a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) or continuation of the current [trend](../t/trend.md).

## Characteristics of the Hikkake Pattern

### Initial Setup
The setup for a Hikkake pattern begins with two specific conditions:
- **Inside Bar:** The first part of the pattern is an inside bar, where the high and low price falls within the [range](../r/range.md) of the preceding bar.
- **Engulfing Bar:** The subsequent bar engulfs the inside bar, closing above its highest point or below its lowest point.

### Failure to Follow Through
The pattern invalidates the apparent [breakout](../b/breakout.md) by failing to sustain the move. This involves the fourth bar that closes back within the [range](../r/range.md) of the inside bar, trapping traders who anticipated a [breakout](../b/breakout.md). The [reversal](../r/reversal.md) happens when there is enough force to drive the price back within the [range](../r/range.md).

### The Confirmation
The confirmation of a Hikkake pattern often comes with a [breakout](../b/breakout.md) in the opposite direction away from the initial failed move. This may happen within three to five trading periods after the initial setup is invalidated.

## Identifying the Hikkake Pattern

### Bullish Hikkake Pattern
1. Look for an inside bar; this is a bar whose high and low prices are completely within the [range](../r/range.md) of the previous bar.
2. The next bar (engulfing bar) must make a lower low than the inside bar, closing lower but still without significant [breakout](../b/breakout.md). This traps bearish traders.
3. The following bar (trap bar), breaks above the inside bar’s high, indicating a [false breakout](../f/false_breakout.md).
4. The confirmation comes when the price moves significantly higher than the engulfing bar.

### Bearish Hikkake Pattern
1. Identify an inside bar where the high and low are within the [range](../r/range.md) of the prior bar.
2. The subsequent bar must make a higher high than the inside bar, often closing higher.
3. The next bar breaks below the inside bar’s low, signaling a [false breakout](../f/false_breakout.md) and trapping bullish traders.
4. Confirmation occurs when the price moves significantly lower than the engulfing bar.

## Trade Execution with Hikkake Pattern

### Entry Point
After identifying and confirming a Hikkake pattern, the entry point for a [trade](../t/trade.md) is generally determined based on whether the pattern is bullish or bearish. For a bullish Hikkake, traders would enter a long position just above the high of the outside bar. In contrast, for a bearish Hikkake, the entry is typically just below the low of the outside bar.

### Stop Loss
A critical part of any [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) is managing [risk](../r/risk.md). For Hikkake trades, a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) is usually placed just beyond the extremity of the pattern. In a bullish scenario, this stop would be below the inside bar's low, and in a bearish scenario, it would be above the inside bar's high.

### Profit Targets
[Profit](../p/profit.md) targets can be derived using various methods, like aiming for the next major support or resistance level or using a fixed-[risk](../r/risk.md) reward ratio like 1:2. [Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels can also aid in setting realistic [profit](../p/profit.md) targets.

## Using Hikkake Pattern Software Tools

The complexity of spotting the Hikkake pattern manually leads some traders to employ [software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) and algorithms for more efficient detection.

### Algorithmic Detection
Institutions and retail traders often use advanced charting tools and custom algorithms to scan for Hikkake patterns across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) assets and time frames. Some algorithms use [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) to adapt and refine the accuracy of Hikkake pattern detection.

### Backtesting
Before employing a Hikkake-based strategy, traders typically backtest it on historical data. This helps in understanding the pattern's reliability and effectiveness in various [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Practical Considerations

### Market Conditions
While the Hikkake pattern can provide valuable signals, its effectiveness can vary based on the [market](../m/market.md) conditions. It works well in trending markets with regular retracements but may produce [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) in highly volatile or choppy markets.

### Time Frames
The Hikkake pattern is visible across different time frames (daily, weekly, or even intra-day charts). However, higher time frames tend to produce more reliable signals due to the reduced [noise](../n/noise.md).

### Combination with Other Indicators
The Hikkake pattern can be more effective when combined with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) or [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md). Moving averages, [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI), and [volume analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md) can add additional layers of confirmation before entering a [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **Flexibility:** The Hikkake pattern can be used in various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes like [stocks](../s/stock.md), forex, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Defined entry and exit points facilitate better [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).
- **Complementary:** Can be used alongside other [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to enhance the probability of success.

### Disadvantages
- **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md):** As with any technical pattern, [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) can occur, leading to potential losses.
- **Subjectivity:** Identifying the pattern can be subjective and may require experience and practice.

## Conclusion

The Hikkake pattern is a [robust](../r/robust.md) tool in the [technical analyst](../t/technical_analyst.md)'s toolkit, providing valuable insights into potential [market](../m/market.md) reversals and continuations. While powerful, it must be used with caution and in conjunction with other analytical methods and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices. By understanding the characteristics, identification process, and [execution](../e/execution.md) strategy of the Hikkake pattern, traders can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) this pattern to enhance their [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md).
