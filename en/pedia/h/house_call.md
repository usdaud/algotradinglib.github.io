# House Call

In the realm of trading, particularly in the context of brokerage accounts and [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md), the term "house call" refers to a [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) that is initiated by a brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md), rather than as a direct result of [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-mandated [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) requirements. Understanding house calls is essential for traders who use [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to amplify their positions in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Margin Trading and Leverage

[Margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) allows traders to borrow funds from their brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) to purchase more securities than could be normally achieved with their available [capital](../c/capital.md). This [leverage](../l/leverage.md) can significantly amplify potential returns, but it also increases the [risk](../r/risk.md) of substantial losses. Traders are required to maintain a minimum [account balance](../a/account_balance.md), known as the [margin](../m/margin.md) requirement, to continue using borrowed funds.

## Types of Margin Requirements

1. **[Initial Margin](../i/initial_margin.md) Requirement**: This is the percentage of the purchase price of securities that the [investor](../i/investor.md) must pay using their own funds when [buying on margin](../b/buying_on_margin.md). It is set by the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T in the United States, which currently requires an [investor](../i/investor.md) to [fund](../f/fund.md) at least 50% of the purchase price.

2. **[Maintenance Margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) Requirement**: This is the minimum account [equity](../e/equity.md) that must be maintained on an ongoing [basis](../b/basis.md). It is a lower percentage compared to the [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) requirement, usually set at 25% by FINRA, though individual brokers can impose higher requirements.

## Margin Call

A [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) occurs when the [equity](../e/equity.md) in a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md) falls below the [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) requirement. To satisfy a [margin call](../m/margin_call.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) must either [deposit](../d/deposit.md) additional funds or securities into the account, or sell existing securities to reduce the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance. There are generally two types of [margin](../m/margin.md) calls:

1. **Regulatory [Margin Call](../m/margin_call.md)**: Triggered by the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) when the account [equity](../e/equity.md) falls below the legally required [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md).

2. **House Call**: Issued by the brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) itself, based on its own, often stricter, [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements.

## House Call: Detailed Examination

A house call is an internal [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) initiated by the brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) due to its [in-house](../i/in-house.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) policies. It acts as a safeguard to ensure that the brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) does not incur significant losses due to the client's trading activities. Brokerage firms often have [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements that are more stringent than those mandated by regulatory authorities. Here's how house calls typically function:

### Reasons for House Calls

- **Brokerage-Specific Policies**: Brokerages establish their own [margin](../m/margin.md) policies to mitigate risks. These policies may require clients to maintain higher [equity](../e/equity.md) levels in their accounts than the regulatory minimum.

- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: During periods of high [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), brokerages may enforce stricter [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements to protect themselves from rapid [market](../m/market.md) movements that could exacerbate losses.

- **Client [Risk](../r/risk.md) Profile**: Accounts with higher-[risk](../r/risk.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) or lower [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) may be subject to tighter [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements, leading to more frequent house calls.

### How House Calls Work

1. **Determination**: The brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) team monitors account balances and assesses the [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure of [margin](../m/margin.md) accounts continuously.

2. **Threshold Breach**: If a client's account [equity](../e/equity.md) falls below the brokerage's internal [margin](../m/margin.md) requirement, a house call is triggered.

3. **Notification**: The brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) notifies the client of the house call, typically through electronic communication methods, detailing the required actions to cover the [margin](../m/margin.md) deficiency.

4. **Action Required**: The client must take immediate action to restore their account [equity](../e/equity.md) to the required level. This may involve depositing additional funds, transferring in securities, or liquidating existing positions to reduce the borrowed amount.

5. **Forced [Liquidation](../l/liquidation.md)**: If the client fails to meet the [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) within the specified timeframe, the brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) may [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) sufficient assets from the account to cover the deficiency and bring the account back into compliance.

### House Call Example

Imagine an [investor](../i/investor.md), Alex, who holds an account with a brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) that has a house [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) requirement of 35%, higher than the regulatory requirement of 25%. Suppose Alex owns $100,000 worth of securities purchased with $50,000 of their own [money](../m/money.md) and $50,000 borrowed from the brokerage ([initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) of 50%).

Due to [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations, the [value](../v/value.md) of Alex's securities drops to $70,000. Alex's [equity](../e/equity.md) in the account is now:

\[ \text{[Equity](../e/equity.md)} = \text{Current [Value](../v/value.md) of Securities} - \text{[Loan](../l/loan.md) Amount} = \$70,000 - \$50,000 = \$20,000 \]

The [equity](../e/equity.md) percentage is:

\[ \text{[Equity](../e/equity.md) Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{[Equity](../e/equity.md)}}{\text{Current [Value](../v/value.md) of Securities}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$20,000}{\$70,000} \right) \times 100 \approx 28.57\% \]

Since the [equity](../e/equity.md) percentage (28.57%) is below the brokerage's house [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) requirement of 35%, a house call is triggered. The brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) requires Alex to increase their [equity](../e/equity.md) percentage back to at least 35%.

The required [equity](../e/equity.md) to meet the house call is:

\[ \text{Required Equity} = \text{Current Value of Securities} \times \text{House [Maintenance Margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md)} = \$70,000 \times 0.35 = \$24,500 \]

Alex needs $24,500 in [equity](../e/equity.md) but currently has $20,000, so they must [deposit](../d/deposit.md) an additional:

\[ \text{Additional Funds Required} = \text{Required [Equity](../e/equity.md)} - \text{Current [Equity](../e/equity.md)} = \$24,500 - \$20,000 = \$4,500 \]

Alternatively, Alex could reduce the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount by selling some of the securities.

## Implications of House Calls

### For Traders

- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: House calls force traders to maintain higher levels of [equity](../e/equity.md), thereby reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of significant losses due to [leverage](../l/leverage.md).
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Requirements**: Traders must be prepared to meet [margin](../m/margin.md) calls quickly, which may require keeping additional [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets available.
- **Strategy Adjustment**: Understanding the brokerage's [margin](../m/margin.md) policies can influence [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), particularly in volatile markets.

### For Brokerages

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation**: House calls help brokerages manage their [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure by ensuring that clients' accounts remain sufficiently funded even during adverse [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
- **Client Financial Stability**: Stricter [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements can help brokerages avoid potential losses from clients who may [default](../d/default.md) on their [margin](../m/margin.md) loans.

## Leading Brokerage Firms with House Call Policies

Several well-known brokerage firms have their own house [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) policies. Some examples include:

- **[Charles Schwab](../c/charles_schwab.md)**: Charles Schwab Margin Handbook
- **TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md)**: TD Ameritrade Margin Handbook
- **[Fidelity Investments](../f/fidelity_investments.md)**: Fidelity Margin Handbook
- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md)**: Interactive Brokers Margin Requirements

Each of these firms provides detailed information about their [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements, including initial and maintenance margins, and the procedures followed when a house call is triggered.

## Conclusion

In summary, a house call is a specific type of [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) initiated by a brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) based on its [in-house](../i/in-house.md) [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements, which are often more stringent than regulatory requirements. These calls play a crucial role in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) for both traders and brokerages. By maintaining higher levels of [equity](../e/equity.md) in [margin](../m/margin.md) accounts, brokerages can protect themselves from potential losses in volatile markets, while traders are compelled to engage in more disciplined [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices. Understanding the nuances of house calls and the specific policies of brokerage firms is essential for anyone engaged in [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) to avoid unexpected liquidations and maintain a sustainable [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).
