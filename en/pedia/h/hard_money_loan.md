# Hard Money Loan

A [hard money](../h/hard_money.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) is a form of [financing](../f/financing.md) that is secured by [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). Unlike traditional loans that are based on the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the borrower, [hard money](../h/hard_money.md) loans are [asset](../a/asset.md)-based, meaning the [loan](../l/loan.md) approval depends primarily on the [value](../v/value.md) of the property being used as [collateral](../c/collateral.md). This type of [loan](../l/loan.md) is typically short-term and is mainly used by [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investors to quickly acquire properties, [finance](../f/finance.md) renovations, or bridge other forms of [financing](../f/financing.md).

## Key Characteristics of Hard Money Loans

### 1. Asset-Based Lending
[Hard money](../h/hard_money.md) loans are backed by [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). Therefore, the most critical [factor](../f/factor.md) in the approval process is the [value](../v/value.md) of the property serving as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) rather than the [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) or financial history of the borrower.

### 2. Short-Term Financing
These loans are generally short-term, often ranging from 6 months to 3 years. They are designed to be a temporary financial solution until the borrower can secure more traditional, longer-term [financing](../f/financing.md).

### 3. Higher Interest Rates
[Interest](../i/interest.md) rates for [hard money](../h/hard_money.md) loans are typically higher than those for conventional loans. This is because they carry more [risk](../r/risk.md) for the [lender](../l/lender.md), given that they are used for high-stakes, quick-[turnaround](../t/turnaround.md) situations like property flipping or redevelopment projects.

### 4. Quick Approval Process
Given that [hard money](../h/hard_money.md) loans are based on the [value](../v/value.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) rather than the borrower's financial standing, the approval process tends to be much quicker, sometimes occurring within days. This rapid approval is advantageous for [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investors who need to act quickly to seize opportunities.

### 5. Flexible Terms and Conditions
Lenders [offering](../o/offering.md) [hard money](../h/hard_money.md) loans can be more flexible with [loan](../l/loan.md) terms compared to traditional banks. Terms can often be negotiated to suit specific project needs, providing borrowers with customized [financing](../f/financing.md) solutions.

## Use Cases for Hard Money Loans

### Real Estate Investment and Flipping
[Hard money](../h/hard_money.md) loans are frequently used by [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investors who purchase properties to renovate and then sell them for a [profit](../p/profit.md). The quick access to funds allows these investors to acquire properties swiftly and begin renovations immediately.

### Bridge Loans
These loans can serve as a bridge between the purchase of a property and its [sale](../s/sale.md) or [refinance](../r/refinance.md). For instance, a [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [investor](../i/investor.md) might use a [hard money](../h/hard_money.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) to purchase a property quickly and then seek traditional [financing](../f/financing.md) after stabilizing the [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Construction Loans
Borrowers looking to undertake substantial development or renovation projects may use [hard money](../h/hard_money.md) loans to [fund](../f/fund.md) construction costs. Once the project is completed, they can [refinance](../r/refinance.md) with a more traditional [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).

### Commercial Properties
Businesses might utilize [hard money](../h/hard_money.md) loans to [finance](../f/finance.md) [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) transactions, especially when they need to move quickly or when a property requires significant repairs before it can be financed through a conventional [loan](../l/loan.md).

## Pros and Cons of Hard Money Loans

### Pros

1. **Speed**: One of the primary advantages is the rapid approval and funding process.
2. **Flexibility**: Terms can often be customized to fit the particular needs of the project or borrower.
3. **Less Stringent Requirements**: [Credit](../c/credit.md) history and financial standing are less of a concern compared to the [value](../v/value.md) of the [collateral](../c/collateral.md).
4. **Opportunity**: Investors can seize time-sensitive opportunities that might require immediate funding.

### Cons

1. **High Costs**: Higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and fees compared to traditional loans can make this a costly [financing](../f/financing.md) option.
2. **Short [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) Terms**: Borrowers must repay the [loan](../l/loan.md) much faster, which might require a [sale](../s/sale.md) or refinancing of the property.
3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Given the high cost and short term, the [risk](../r/risk.md) of not being able to repay the [loan](../l/loan.md) is higher.

## The Lending Process

### 1. Application
Borrowers must first complete an application detailing the property and the intended use of the [loan](../l/loan.md). This could include information on the projected [value](../v/value.md) after renovation, plans for the property, and the amount needed.

### 2. Property Evaluation
The [lender](../l/lender.md) [will](../w/will.md) conduct an evaluation of the property, which might include an [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md), to determine its current and potential after-repair [value](../v/value.md) (ARV).

### 3. Terms Agreement
If the [lender](../l/lender.md) decides to proceed, they [will](../w/will.md) outline the [loan](../l/loan.md) terms, including [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedule, and any additional fees such as [origination](../o/origination.md) fees, processing fees, or points.

### 4. Approval and Funding
Once terms are agreed upon, the [loan](../l/loan.md) is approved, and funds are disbursed. This process can often be completed within a few days, depending on the [lender](../l/lender.md)'s [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) and property evaluation.

### 5. Loan Repayment
Throughout the [loan](../l/loan.md) term, the borrower makes [interest](../i/interest.md)-only monthly payments, with the [principal](../p/principal.md) due in a lump sum at the end of the term.
