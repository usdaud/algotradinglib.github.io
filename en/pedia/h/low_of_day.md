# Low Of Day

The low of day is the lowest traded price of a security during the current trading session. It is a key reference for breakdown and momentum strategies.

## Why it matters
- A break below the low of day can signal intraday weakness.
- The level often attracts stop orders and liquidity.
- It can act as support if price fails to break lower.

## Example
A stock trades between 30 and 31. When price breaks below 30, a trader sells short with a stop above the prior range.

## Practical notes
Low of day breaks are more reliable when supported by volume and broader market weakness.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Low Of Day and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Low Of Day as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Low Of Day, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Low Of Day. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Low Of Day alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
