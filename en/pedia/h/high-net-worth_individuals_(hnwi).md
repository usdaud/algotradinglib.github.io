# High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWI)

High-Net-Worth Individuals, commonly abbreviated as HNWIs, are individuals or families who [hold](../h/hold.md) significant levels of [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets, typically excluding their primary residence. The concept of HNWI is commonly used by the financial services [industry](../i/industry.md) to demarcate a segment of clientele demanding specialized financial services due to their significant [wealth](../w/wealth.md).

## Definition and Thresholds

HNWI categorizations often come with specific financial thresholds:
- **High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI):** Typically defined as having [liquid](../l/liquid.md) financial assets of $1 million or more.
- **Very-High-Net-Worth Individual (VHNWI):** Usually defined as having [liquid](../l/liquid.md) financial assets of $5 million or more.
- **Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individual (UHNWI):** Generally describes individuals with [liquid](../l/liquid.md) financial assets of $30 million or more.

These thresholds are not universally standard and can vary by financial institution or geographical region. The commonality is their use to identify clients who require high levels of personal banking, [investment management](../i/investment_management.md), and financial advisory services.

## Characteristics of HNWIs

2. **[Risk Tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md):** This group generally has a higher [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), especially UHNWI, who may allocate a portion of their [wealth](../w/wealth.md) to high-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-reward opportunities.
3. **Geographic Diversity:** Many HNWIs [hold](../h/hold.md) assets internationally to diversify [risk](../r/risk.md), take advantage of different [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and sometimes for tax [optimization](../o/optimization.md).
4. **[Philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md):** A significant portion of HNWIs engage in philanthropic activities, often setting up private foundations or trusts.
5. **Legacy Planning:** [Estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) preservation are critical, involving trusts, wills, and the transfer of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) to younger generations while minimizing tax liabilities.
