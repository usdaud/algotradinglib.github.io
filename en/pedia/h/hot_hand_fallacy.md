# Hot Hand Fallacy

The hot hand fallacy is the belief that a streak of success will continue because of skill alone. In trading, it can lead to overconfidence, oversized positions, and poor risk control.

## How it appears in trading
- Increasing size after a series of wins without evidence of edge.
- Ignoring risk limits because recent trades worked out.
- Assuming the market will keep rewarding the same pattern.

## Why it matters
Markets are noisy and outcomes are not fully predictable. A winning streak can be luck rather than a stable edge. Overconfidence often precedes large losses.

## Example
A trader wins five trades in a row and doubles position size on the next setup. The next trade loses more than the prior gains, wiping out the streak.

## Mitigation
Use fixed risk limits, review performance over larger samples, and separate process quality from short term outcomes.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Hot Hand Fallacy and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Hot Hand Fallacy as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Hot Hand Fallacy, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Hot Hand Fallacy. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Hot Hand Fallacy alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
