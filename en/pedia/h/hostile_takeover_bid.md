# Hostile Takeover Bid

A [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md) [bid](../b/bid.md) is a type of [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) in which a company (the acquirer) seeks to take control of another company (the target) against the wishes of the target's management and board of directors. Hostile takeovers are often pursued when the target company is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) or when the acquirer believes that the target company’s management is underperforming. This form of [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) can be traced back to the 1980s with a notable increase in [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md) activities during that period.

## Mechanisms of Hostile Takeover

There are several strategies that acquirers use to execute a [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md) [bid](../b/bid.md):

### 1. Tender Offer

A [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md) involves the acquirer proposing to purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) from the target company's shareholders at a [premium](../p/premium.md) price, usually at least a 20% to 30% higher than the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). The acquirer directly communicates with the shareholders, bypassing the company's management and board of directors. The goal is to entice the shareholders to sell their [shares](../s/shares.md) by [offering](../o/offering.md) them a significantly better deal.

### 2. Proxy Fight

In a [proxy fight](../p/proxy_fight.md), the acquirer tries to persuade the target company's shareholders to use their [proxy](../p/proxy.md) votes to install new management that is friendly to the [takeover](../t/takeover.md). This often involves extensive campaigning to convince shareholders that the current management is not acting in their best [interest](../i/interest.md) and that new [leadership](../l/leadership.md) would be beneficial for the company.

### 3. Buying Shares on the Open Market

Acquirers may also attempt to amass a large number of [shares](../s/shares.md) by purchasing them on the [open market](../o/open_market.md). Once the acquirer holds a substantial percentage of the company's [shares](../s/shares.md), they can exert more influence over the company's decisions and potentially [gain](../g/gain.md) control.

## Defense Mechanisms Against Hostile Takeovers

Target companies have developed various strategies to defend against hostile takeovers:

### 1. Poison Pill

The [poison pill](../p/poison_pill.md) strategy, also known as a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) rights plan, allows existing shareholders to purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md) at a [discount](../d/discount.md) if a single [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) acquires a certain percentage of the company's [shares](../s/shares.md). This dilutes the [value](../v/value.md) of the [shares](../s/shares.md) acquired by the hostile bidder, making the [takeover](../t/takeover.md) less attractive.

### 2. Staggered Board

A staggered board is a tactic where the company staggers the terms of its board members so that only a fraction of the board is up for election each year. This makes it difficult for the acquirer to [gain](../g/gain.md) control quickly through a [proxy fight](../p/proxy_fight.md).

### 3. Golden Parachute

Golden parachutes are [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) financial packages awarded to top executives if they are terminated as a result of a [takeover](../t/takeover.md). This makes the prospect of a [takeover](../t/takeover.md) more expensive and less attractive to the acquirer.

### 4. White Knight

A [white knight](../w/white_knight.md) is a more favorable company that the target company seeks to merge with instead of the hostile bidder. The [white knight](../w/white_knight.md) offers better terms and is more aligned with the target company's goals and values.

## Examples of Notable Hostile Takeovers

### 1. The Takeover of RJR Nabisco by KKR

One of the most famous hostile takeovers was the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of RJR Nabisco by the [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (KKR) in 1988. The deal was worth $31.1 billion and is chronicled in the book "Barbarians at the Gate" by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. KKR's aggressive [bid](../b/bid.md) for RJR Nabisco became a landmark in the history of [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md).

### 2. The Battle for Yahoo!

Microsoft's [bid](../b/bid.md) to acquire Yahoo! in 2008 is a well-known example of a [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md) attempt. Microsoft made an unsolicited [offer](../o/offer.md) of $44.6 billion, which was rejected by Yahoo!’s management. Despite increasing the [offer](../o/offer.md), Microsoft eventually withdrew its [bid](../b/bid.md) due to strong opposition from Yahoo!’s board.

### 3. The Hostile Takeover of Airgas by Air Products

In 2010, Air Products made a [hostile bid](../h/hostile_bid.md) to acquire Airgas, a process industrial gas provider. Airgas rejected [multiple](../m/multiple.md) offers from Air Products, which led to a protracted and publicized battle. Ultimately, Air Products dropped its [bid](../b/bid.md) in 2011.

## Benefits and Drawbacks of Hostile Takeovers

### Benefits

1. **[Shareholder Value](../s/shareholder_value.md)**: Hostile takeovers can provide significant immediate [value](../v/value.md) to shareholders if the [bid](../b/bid.md) offers a substantial [premium](../p/premium.md) over the current share price.
2. **Management Accountability**: They can serve as a [check](../c/check.md) against ineffective management, often leading to improvements in the target company's operations.
3. **[Market Efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md)**: Hostile takeovers can help ensure that resources are utilized optimally by replacing underperforming management with more competent [leadership](../l/leadership.md).

### Drawbacks

1. **Cultural Clash**: They can result in significant cultural upheaval, with changes in management leading to [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) among employees and stakeholders.
2. **Short-term Focus**: The focus on immediate gains can detract from long-term strategic goals.
3. **Operational Disruption**: Hostile takeovers can lead to disruptions in the day-to-day operations of the target company, causing distractions and potentially harming performance.

## Regulation and Legal Framework

Hostile takeovers are subject to various regulatory and legal constraints designed to protect the interests of shareholders and ensure fair [market](../m/market.md) practices. In the United States, the primary regulatory body overseeing these activities is the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). Key regulations include:

### 1. The Williams Act

The [Williams Act](../w/williams_act.md) of 1968 requires anyone acquiring more than 5% of a company's stock to disclose their intentions to the SEC, the company, and the public. This [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) must include information about the purpose of the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) and any plans for changes in corporate structure or management.

### 2. State Anti-Takeover Laws

Various U.S. states have enacted laws to protect companies from hostile takeovers. These laws often impose additional requirements on acquirers, making it more difficult to execute a [hostile bid](../h/hostile_bid.md). Examples include:

- **Fair Price Provisions**: Require that all shareholders receive the same price in a [takeover](../t/takeover.md) [bid](../b/bid.md).
- **Control Share [Acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) Statutes**: Limit the voting rights of large shareholders unless other shareholders approve the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

## Conclusion

Hostile takeovers remain a controversial but integral part of the corporate landscape. They highlight the complex dynamics between shareholders, management, and regulatory bodies while underscoring the importance of [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) rights. For acquirers, the challenge lies in navigating the regulatory environment and overcoming the target company's defenses. For target companies, the focus is on protecting [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md) while ensuring that any changes align with long-term strategic goals. Ultimately, the impact of hostile takeovers can be profound, influencing corporate strategies, management practices, and [market](../m/market.md) behaviors for years to come.
