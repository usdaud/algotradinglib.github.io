# Horizontal Support And Resistance

Horizontal support and resistance are price levels where buying or selling pressure has repeatedly emerged. These levels are drawn as horizontal lines across the chart to mark areas of supply or demand.

## How levels form
- Repeated swing highs create resistance.
- Repeated swing lows create support.
- Prior consolidation ranges can form both.

## Trading use
Traders watch for breakouts, breakdowns, and retests around these levels. A level that flips from resistance to support can confirm a trend change.

## Example
A stock fails at 75 three times. When price finally breaks above 75 and holds, the level becomes support for future pullbacks.

## Limitations
Levels are zones rather than exact prices. Market noise can create false breaks, so confirmation is important.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Horizontal Support And Resistance and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Horizontal Support And Resistance as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Horizontal Support And Resistance, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Horizontal Support And Resistance. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Horizontal Support And Resistance alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
