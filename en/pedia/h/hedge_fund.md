# Hedge Fund

[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds are [alternative investment](../a/alternative_investment.md) vehicles that use [pooled funds](../p/pooled_funds.md) and employ various strategies to earn active returns for their investors. These strategies can include leveraging, [short selling](../s/short_selling.md), [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and other sophisticated practices that are generally not accessible through traditional [investing](../i/investing.md) vehicles. The aim of [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds is often to provide high returns, regardless of [market](../m/market.md) conditions, while mitigating risks.

## History and Evolution

The term "[hedge](../h/hedge.md) [fund](../f/fund.md)" was first coined by Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949. Jones introduced the concept of reducing [risk](../r/risk.md) by combining a long position in equities (buying [stocks](../s/stock.md)) with [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) (borrowing [stocks](../s/stock.md) to sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price). This strategy was designed to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [market](../m/market.md) downturns, hence the term "[hedge](../h/hedge.md) [fund](../f/fund.md)".

Over the decades, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds evolved to include a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of investment strategies, including:

1. **[Market Neutral](../m/market_neutral.md)**: Balancing long and short positions in such a way that the returns are insulated from [market](../m/market.md) movements.
2. **[Global Macro](../g/global_macro.md)**: [Investing](../i/investing.md) based on the economic and political views of entire nations.
3. **Event-Driven**: [Investing](../i/investing.md) strategies based on events such as mergers, acquisitions, or bankruptcies.
4. **[Relative Value](../r/relative_value.md)**: Taking advantage of price discrepancies between related securities.

## Structure and Operation

[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds typically have a [general partner](../g/general_partner.md) (GP) and limited partners (LPs). The [general partner](../g/general_partner.md) is responsible for managing the portfolio and making investment decisions, while the limited partners provide the [capital](../c/capital.md) but have [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md).

### General Partner (GP)

The [General Partner](../g/general_partner.md) is usually the [hedge fund manager](../h/hedge_fund_manager.md) and is responsible for the following:

- **[Portfolio Management](../p/par.md)**: Selecting investments, managing [risk](../r/risk.md), and executing trades.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring that the [fund](../f/fund.md) complies with relevant regulations.
- **[Investor Relations](../i/investor_relations.md)**: Managing communications, reporting, and interactions with limited partners.

### Limited Partners (LPs)

The Limited Partners are the investors who provide the [capital](../c/capital.md). They can be:

- **Institutional Investors**: Such as pension funds, endowments, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies.
- **High Net-Worth Individuals**: Wealthy individuals looking for higher returns through alternative investments.

## Fee Structure

[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds typically use a "2 and 20" [fee](../f/fee.md) structure, which includes:

- **[Management Fee](../m/management_fee.md)**: Usually around 2% of the assets under management (AUM), paid annually to cover operating costs.
- **Performance [Fee](../f/fee.md)**: Typically 20% of the profits earned, incentivizing the [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) to maximize returns.

## Strategies

[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds employ a wide [range](../r/range.md) of strategies to achieve their investment objectives. These can be broadly categorized into the following:

### Equity Long/Short

This strategy involves taking long positions in [stocks](../s/stock.md) expected to increase in [value](../v/value.md) and short positions in [stocks](../s/stock.md) expected to decline. The goal is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from both up and down movements in the [market](../m/market.md). This approach helps to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [market](../m/market.md) risks.

### Market Neutral

[Market neutral strategies](../m/market_neutral_strategies.md) aim to generate returns independent of [market](../m/market.md) movements. This is achieved by balancing long and short positions such that the overall [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md) is minimal. The focus is on exploiting specific opportunities without taking on overall [market risk](../m/market_risk.md).

### Global Macro

[Global macro strategies](../g/global_macro_strategies.md) involve making investment decisions based on macroeconomic trends, such as [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [currency](../c/currency.md) movements, and political developments. These funds often invest in a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including equities, bonds, commodities, and currencies.

### Event-Driven

Event-driven strategies focus on opportunities created by specific corporate events like mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, and spin-offs. These can further be broken down into:

- **[Merger Arbitrage](../m/merger_arbitrage.md)**: Involves buying and selling [stocks](../s/stock.md) of companies involved in mergers or acquisitions.
- **[Distressed Securities](../d/distressed_securities.md)**: Involves [investing](../i/investing.md) in companies undergoing [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) or [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md).

### Relative Value

[Relative value](../r/relative_value.md) strategies seek to exploit price discrepancies between related securities. For example, a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) might simultaneously buy and sell [options](../o/options.md) on the same [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock to [profit](../p/profit.md) from [volatility](../v/volatility.md) differences.

### Quantitative Strategies

[Quantitative strategies](../q/quantitative_strategies_in_trading.md) use [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and algorithms to identify trading opportunities. These can include:

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Exploiting statistical relationships between [asset](../a/asset.md) prices.
- **High-Frequency Trading**: Utilizing algorithms to execute large numbers of trades in fractions of a second.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Potential for Higher Returns**: [Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds aim to deliver significant returns, often outperforming traditional investment vehicles.
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: These funds [offer](../o/offer.md) exposure to non-traditional [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and strategies, providing [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md).
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Many [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds use advanced [risk management techniques](../r/risk_management_techniques.md) to protect [capital](../c/capital.md) during [market](../m/market.md) downturns.

### Disadvantages

- **High Fees**: The "2 and 20" [fee](../f/fee.md) structure can significantly eat into returns.
- **[Illiquidity](../i/illiquid.md)**: Many [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds require investors to lock in their [capital](../c/capital.md) for long periods.
- **Complexity**: The strategies employed can be highly complex and opaque.

## Regulation

[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds are subject to various regulations depending on the jurisdiction in which they operate. In the United States, they are primarily regulated by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). However, they enjoy more flexibility compared to mutual funds and other traditional investment vehicles.
