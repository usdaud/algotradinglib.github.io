# Hard Skills

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), also known as algo trading or black-box trading, is the process of using computers programmed to follow a defined set of instructions (an algorithm) for placing a [trade](../t/trade.md) in [order](../o/order.md) to generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human [trader](../t/trader.md). The defined sets of instructions are based on timing, price, quantity, or any mathematical model. Apart from the obvious benefits, some crucial hard skills are vital for anyone aiming to succeed in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).

## Programming Skills

### Languages and Key Tools
To engage in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) effectively, programming is indispensable. The most commonly used programming languages in this domain include:

rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
rf_clf.fit(features, labels)

predictions = rf_clf.predict(features)
```

[Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) enables the development of adaptive and self-improving [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
