# Historical Price Analysis

Historical price analysis is a cornerstone of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and a pivotal tool for traders, investors, and financial analysts. It involves the examination of past price movements to forecast future trends and make informed trading decisions. This analysis is grounded on the time-series data of financial instruments, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, forex, and cryptocurrencies.

## Objectives of Historical Price Analysis

The primary objectives of historical price analysis include:

1. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Identification**: Detecting upward, downward, or sideways trends in price movements.
2. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Assessment**: Gauging the degree of price variation over time to assess [risk](../r/risk.md).
3. **[Pattern Recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md)**: Identifying repetitive [price patterns](../p/price_patterns.md) that can signal potential future price movements.
4. **[Support and Resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) Levels**: Determining historically significant price points where a stock's price finds it difficult to break through.
5. **Cyclical Analysis**: Recognizing repetitive cycles in price movements related to seasonal or economic factors.

## Key Concepts in Historical Price Analysis

### 1. Time Series Data

[Time series](../t/time_series.md) data is a sequence of price data points indexed in time [order](../o/order.md). This data is the foundation for most historical price analysis techniques. [Time series](../t/time_series.md) can be:
- **Intraday**: Prices recorded every few minutes or hours within a single trading day.
- **Daily**: Prices recorded at the end of each trading day.
- **Weekly/Monthly**: Prices recorded at the end of every week or month.

### 2. Moving Averages

Moving averages smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price over a specific period. The two main types are:
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: The average price over a defined period.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Gives more weight to recent prices for a quicker response to price changes.

### 3. Technical Indicators

[Technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) are calculations based on price, [volume](../v/volume.md), or [open interest](../o/open_interest.md) data, aiming to forecast future price movements. Some widely used indicators include:
- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI)**: Measures the speed and change of price movements.
- **Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD)**: Shows the relationship between two moving averages of a [security](../s/security.md)’s price.
- **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) bands placed above and below a moving average.

### 4. Chart Patterns

[Chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md) are formations created by the movement of [security](../s/security.md) prices on a chart and are pivotal in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). Common patterns include:
- **Head and Shoulders**: A [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern that signals a [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md).
- **[Double Top](../d/double_top.md) and Bottom**: Patterns indicating a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) in price movements.
- **Triangles**: [Continuation patterns](../c/continuation_patterns.md) that indicate periods of [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) before the price moves beyond the [triangle](../t/triangle.md).

### 5. Support and Resistance Levels

[Support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels are specific price points on a chart where the price has had difficulty moving above or below. These levels can signify:
- **Support**: A [price level](../p/price_level.md) where a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) can be expected to pause due to a concentration of [demand](../d/demand.md).
- **Resistance**: A [price level](../p/price_level.md) where an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) can be expected to pause due to a concentration of selling [interest](../i/interest.md).
