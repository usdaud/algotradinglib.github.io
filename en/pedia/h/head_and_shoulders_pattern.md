# Head and Shoulders Pattern

The Head and Shoulders pattern is a financial [market](../m/market.md) analysis chart pattern that predicts a bullish-to-bearish [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md). It is one of the most reliable and frequently encountered trading patterns and is used by traders across a variety of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including equities, commodities, and forex.

#### Components of the Head and Shoulders Pattern

The Head and Shoulders pattern is composed of four main parts:
1. **Left Shoulder**: This is characterized by a price increase followed by a peak and then a decline.
2. **Head**: This forms when the price rises again, creating a higher peak than the left shoulder before it declines again.
3. **Right Shoulder**: The price rises again but does not reach the high of the head before declining.
4. **[Neckline](../n/neckline.md)**: This is a support line drawn through the lows of the left shoulder, head, and right shoulder. The [neckline](../n/neckline.md) can be upward sloping, downward sloping, or horizontal.

#### Types of Head and Shoulders Patterns

1. **Standard (Top) Head and Shoulders Pattern**: This indicates a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) from a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md) to a bearish [trend](../t/trend.md). It is formed after an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) and signals that the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price is likely to move lower.
2. **Inverse (Bottom) Head and Shoulders Pattern**: This indicates a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) from a bearish [trend](../t/trend.md) to a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md). It is formed after a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) and signals that the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price is likely to move higher.

#### Psychological Background

The formation of the Head and Shoulders pattern is driven by [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [market](../m/market.md) psychology:
- **Left Shoulder**: This reflects an initial attempt to continue an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) or [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).
- **Head**: Reflects a stronger attempt to push the [trend](../t/trend.md) further, reaching lower lows or higher highs.
- **Right Shoulder**: Reflects a weaker attempt which fails to surpass the [trend](../t/trend.md) established by the head, indicating a potential exhaustion in the [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **[Neckline](../n/neckline.md) Break**: A decisive break of the [neckline](../n/neckline.md) confirms the pattern, reflecting a shift in [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).

#### How to Trade Head and Shoulders Pattern

1. **Identify the Pattern**: Spot the Left Shoulder, Head, Right Shoulder, and the [Neckline](../n/neckline.md).
2. **Wait for the [Breakout](../b/breakout.md)**: Do not [trade](../t/trade.md) until the price breaks the [neckline](../n/neckline.md).
3. **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Entry**: Once the [neckline](../n/neckline.md) is broken, enter a [trade](../t/trade.md) in the direction of the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
4. **Stop Loss**: Position your stop loss above the right shoulder (for Standard pattern) or below the right shoulder (for Inverse pattern).
5. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target**: Measure the distance from the top of the head to the [neckline](../n/neckline.md). Project this distance from the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point to estimate the [profit](../p/profit.md) target.

#### Example of Head and Shoulders Pattern

Consider the stock price of Company XYZ:
- Left Shoulder formed at $50 with a decline to $40.
- Head formed as the price rose to $60 and fell back to $40.
- Right Shoulder formed at $45 with a subsequent decline.
- [Neckline](../n/neckline.md) is drawn at $40.
- Upon breaking the [neckline](../n/neckline.md) at $40, the price fell to $25, confirming the pattern.

#### Related Concepts

- **[Volume Confirmation](../v/volume_confirmation.md)**: Traders often look for [volume confirmation](../v/volume_confirmation.md), where [volume](../v/volume.md) should ideally decrease on the formation of the head and rise during the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
- **[Trend Analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md)**: The Head and Shoulders is a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern, thus it is crucial to identify existing trends.
- **[Support and Resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md)**: The [neckline](../n/neckline.md) acts as a support (for Standard pattern) or resistance (for Inverse pattern).

#### Real-world Application

Algorthmic traders, quant funds, and individual investors use the Head and Shoulders pattern in various ways:
- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Algo traders implement the pattern into [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) to backtest its efficacy across historical data.
- **Live Trading**: Incorporate real-time detection of the pattern into [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md).
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine Head and Shoulders with other indicators like moving averages, RSI to increase accuracy.
