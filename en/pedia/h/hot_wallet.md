# Hot Wallet

A hot wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the internet. While physical cash is stored in a physical wallet, digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are stored in digital wallets. These wallets can be used to store, send, and receive digital currencies. The key feature of a hot wallet is that it facilitates instant transactions and provides real-time access to balances. However, the constant internet connection also means that hot wallets are more susceptible to hacking attempts and cyber attacks than their offline counterparts, known as cold wallets.

## Types of Hot Wallets

### Web Wallets
Web wallets are online platforms that allow users to access their cryptocurrency [holdings](../h/holdings.md) through a web browser. Users need to log in with their credentials to manage their funds. Examples of web wallets include Blockchain.com, Coinbase, and Binance. They are highly convenient because they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, but they also pose a higher [security](../s/security.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Mobile Wallets
Mobile wallets are applications designed for smartphones. These apps provide the convenience of managing cryptocurrencies on-the-go. Examples include Trust Wallet, Mycelium, and Exodus. Mobile wallets often incorporate additional [security](../s/security.md) features like fingerprint authentication and PIN codes.

### Desktop Wallets
Desktop wallets are software programs installed on a computer. They [offer](../o/offer.md) a more secure alternative to web wallets since they are only accessible from the specific machine they are installed on. Notable examples include Electrum, Atomic Wallet, and Armory. However, if the computer is compromised by malware or hacking, the funds stored in the desktop wallet can be at [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Exchange Wallets
Cryptocurrency exchanges typically [offer](../o/offer.md) their users built-in wallets to facilitate trading. While convenient, these wallets also place the control of private keys in the hands of the [exchange](../e/exchange.md), which raises [security](../s/security.md) and [trust](../t/trust.md) concerns. Examples include Kraken, Bitfinex, and Bittrex.

## Security Features

### Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
Multi-[factor](../f/factor.md) authentication adds an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md) beyond just a password. Many hot wallets support MFA, which can include the use of SMS codes, email confirmations, or authentication apps like Google Authenticator.

### Private Keys and Seed Phrases
When setting up a hot wallet, users are often provided with a private key or a seed phrase. These are crucial for accessing the wallet and its funds. It's essential to store these securely; anyone with access to private keys or seed phrases can control the wallet's contents.

### Encryption
Many hot wallets use advanced encryption methods to protect user data and private keys. Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read by unauthorized parties.

## Advantages of Hot Wallets

- **Convenience**: Hot wallets [offer](../o/offer.md) quick and easy access to funds, ideal for frequent transactions.
- **User-friendly**: Many hot wallets feature intuitive interfaces and [customer](../c/customer.md) support.
- **Integration with Services**: Hot wallets often integrate with cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial services, [offering](../o/offering.md) additional functionality such as trading and staking.

## Disadvantages of Hot Wallets

- **[Security](../s/security.md) Risks**: Their constant internet connection makes them more vulnerable to hacking and cyber-attacks.
- **[Trust](../t/trust.md) Issues**: Some hot wallets, particularly web and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) wallets, require trusting a third-party service provider.
- **Device Dependency**: Loss or compromise of the device on which the wallet is stored can lead to loss of access to funds.

## Real-world Examples

### Binance Wallet
[Binance](../b/binance.md) offers a hot wallet service called the [Binance](../b/binance.md) Chain Wallet, which allows users to manage [Binance](../b/binance.md) Coin (BNB) and other [Binance](../b/binance.md) Chain assets. The wallet is integrated directly with the [Binance](../b/binance.md) [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md), providing seamless trading capabilities. However, being an [exchange](../e/exchange.md) wallet, users need to [trust](../t/trust.md) [Binance](../b/binance.md) with the [security](../s/security.md) of their assets.

## Setting Up a Hot Wallet

1. **Download and Install**: Choose a reputable wallet provider and download the app or software. Ensure that you only download from the public materials to avoid phishing attempts.
2. **Create an Account**: Follow the instructions to set up a new wallet. This usually involves creating a username and password.
3. **Backup Private Keys/Seed Phrase**: Write down the private keys or seed phrase in a secure place. This step is crucial for backup and recovery.
4. **Enable [Security](../s/security.md) Features**: Set up multi-[factor](../f/factor.md) authentication and any other [security](../s/security.md) features available.
5. **Transfer Funds**: Once the wallet is set up, you can transfer funds into your wallet by sending them to your unique wallet address.

## Best Practices for Using Hot Wallets

- **Use MFA**: Always enable multi-[factor](../f/factor.md) authentication to add an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md).
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your wallet software and device operating systems updated to protect against vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Backup**: Store private keys and seed phrases in a secure location, such as a hardware wallet or a secure offline storage solution.
