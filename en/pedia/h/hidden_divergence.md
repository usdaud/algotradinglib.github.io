# Hidden Divergence

Hidden divergence is a technical analysis concept that signals trend continuation rather than reversal. It occurs when price makes a higher low or lower high while the indicator makes the opposite extreme.

## Bullish hidden divergence
- Price makes a higher low.
- An oscillator like RSI makes a lower low.
- This suggests momentum is resetting while the uptrend remains intact.

## Bearish hidden divergence
- Price makes a lower high.
- The oscillator makes a higher high.
- This suggests a downtrend may continue after a pullback.

## Example
Price is in an uptrend and pulls back to a higher low, while RSI drops to a lower low. A trader sees this as bullish hidden divergence and looks for a continuation entry.

## Practical notes
Hidden divergence is more reliable when aligned with a clear trend and higher timeframe structure.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Hidden Divergence and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Hidden Divergence as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Hidden Divergence, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Hidden Divergence. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Hidden Divergence alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
