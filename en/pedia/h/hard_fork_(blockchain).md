# Hard Fork (Blockchain)

A **hard fork** in the context of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology refers to a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid, or vice versa. It requires all nodes or users to [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) to the latest version of the protocol software. This split in the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) can create two separate chains, and it often arises as a solution to address disagreements within the community or to implement upgrades and improvements to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) network.

## How Hard Forks Happen

Hard forks occur when the developers of a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) platform decide that significant changes need to be made to the system’s protocol. This can be due to differing visions on particular project development directions, [security](../s/security.md) concerns, or the need for new functionalities that current rules do not support. These modifications are not backward compatible. Therefore, every participant on the network (miners, nodes, users) must [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) to the new protocol to continue participating in the new [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). Those who do not [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) remain on the old chain, thereby creating a split.

### Preparation and Proposal

Before a hard fork can be implemented, it must be proposed and prepared carefully:

- **Proposal:** A new proposal for changes is made. It outlines what modifications [will](../w/will.md) be made to the existing protocol.
- **Consensus:** Support must be gathered within the community. This is typically done through forums, improvement proposals (like the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Improvement Proposal - BIP), or voting systems.
- **Development:** Once a consensus is reached, the development for the new protocol version begins.
- **Testing:** The new version is tested rigorously to ensure there are no critical bugs or issues that might harm the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)’s operation.

### Activation

Upon successful testing, a block number is designated as the point at which the fork [will](../w/will.md) occur. Nodes need to [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) before reaching this block number. Once the network hits the predetermined block number, the changes come into effect, splitting the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) into two versions: one running the old protocol and one running the new protocol.

## Examples of Hard Forks

### Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

[Bitcoin Cash](../b/bitcoin_cash.md) is perhaps the most well-known example of a hard fork. It was created on August 1, 2017, as a result of a disagreement in the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) community regarding how to scale the network. The [Bitcoin Cash](../b/bitcoin_cash.md) proponents advocated for increasing the block size to 8MB to allow more transactions to be processed per block, as opposed to 1MB in [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md). This disagreement led to a hard fork, creating two separate chains: [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) (BTC) and [Bitcoin Cash](../b/bitcoin_cash.md) (BCH).


### Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC)

Another significant example of a hard fork is the split between [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic (ETC). This fork occurred in July 2016 following the infamous DAO hack, where an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the DAO’s smart contract code and managed to siphon away millions of dollars worth of Ether. The community reached a consensus to perform a hard fork to [return](../r/return.md) the stolen funds, resulting in two blockchains: [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (with the restored funds) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic (where the theft is part of the immutable history).


## Reasons for Hard Forks

### Security Issues

Often, hard forks are implemented to address severe [security](../s/security.md) vulnerabilities that cannot be resolved through a soft fork or minor update. Upgrading to a more secure protocol ensures the integrity and safety of the network.

### New Features and Improvements

Hard forks may be necessary to introduce substantial new features and functionality to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), such as improved [transaction](../t/transaction.md) speeds, increased block sizes, or support for new types of transactions and scripts. These updates can bring significant benefits but require network-wide consensus to implement.

### Disagreements in Vision

Sometimes, community members and project developers have differing visions for the project's future. When these differences become irreconcilable, a hard fork allows for the creation of a new chain that aligns more closely with one set of beliefs or goals.

### Recovery from Catastrophic Events

In rare cases, a hard fork may be used to recover from significant unintended occurrences, such as large-scale hacks, bugs, or errors that severely impact the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). This was the case with [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md)'s hard fork after the DAO hack.

## Risks and Challenges

### Network Split

One of the primary risks associated with hard forks is the potential for a permanent network split, where two competing chains continue to operate simultaneously. This results in a divided community and duplicate chains that compete for resources and legitimacy.

### Market Impact

Hard forks can have significant impacts on [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). The creation of a new [asset](../a/asset.md) (such as [Bitcoin Cash](../b/bitcoin_cash.md) from [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)) can lead to [market](../m/market.md) confusion, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and shifts in investment. Traders and investors must navigate these changes carefully to protect their investments.

### Security Vulnerabilities

Introducing a new protocol version comes with its own set of risks. If the new code is not thoroughly audited and tested, it could introduce new vulnerabilities or bugs that could be exploited. Ensuring a [robust](../r/robust.md) and secure [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) process is critical.

## Managing Hard Forks

### Community Governance

An essential aspect of managing hard forks is the governance model of the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) project. Transparent and inclusive decision-making processes help garner support and minimize disagreements. Community forums, votes, and improvement proposals are often used to facilitate governance.

### Communication

Clear and consistent communication is vital before, during, and after a hard fork. Stakeholders need to be informed about the reasons for the fork, how they can prepare, and what measures need to be taken to smoothly transition to the new protocol.

### Support Services

Providing adequate support services for users can help ease the transition. This includes detailed documentation, [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) guides, and [customer](../c/customer.md) support to assist users in upgrading their software and understanding the implications of the fork.

## Conclusion

A hard fork is a double-edged sword in the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) world. While it provides a mechanism for implementing significant changes, resolving contentious issues, and introducing new features, it also comes with the inherent risks of network splits, [security](../s/security.md) vulnerabilities, and [market](../m/market.md) disruptions. Managing these challenges requires careful planning, clear communication, and [robust](../r/robust.md) governance to ensure the continued integrity and success of the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) network. Understanding the nuances and implications of hard forks is crucial for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) space.
