# Halt

A trading halt is a temporary pause in trading for a security or an entire market. Halts are used to manage extreme volatility, disseminate material news, or address operational issues.

## Common reasons
- Pending news that could materially affect price.
- Volatility controls triggered by rapid price moves.
- Regulatory or compliance concerns.
- Technical problems at the exchange.

## Types of halts
- News pending or news released halts.
- Volatility pauses under limit up limit down rules.
- Market wide circuit breakers.

## Effects on traders
During a halt, orders may be queued or canceled depending on venue rules. Price discovery resumes when trading reopens, often with a reopening auction.

## Example
A stock jumps 20 percent after an acquisition rumor and triggers a volatility halt. Trading resumes after a short pause once the exchange runs a reopening auction.

## Practical notes
Traders should understand broker order handling during halts and avoid assumptions about immediate execution when trading resumes.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Halt and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Halt as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Halt, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Halt. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Halt alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
