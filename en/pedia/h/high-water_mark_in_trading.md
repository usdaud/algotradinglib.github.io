# High-Water Mark

The concept of a High-Water Mark (HWM) is pivotal in the realm of trading, particularly in [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds, and other investment vehicles where performance incentives are a key component. At its core, a High-Water Mark ensures that [fund](../f/fund.md) managers are only compensated for performance fees once the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [value](../v/value.md) surpasses its previous peak. This mechanism acts as a performance [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), safeguarding investors from paying fees on the same gains more than once.

### Key Features of High-Water Mark

1. **Performance-Based Compensation**: The HWM is integral to the structure of performance fees. Managers earn these fees only when the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [value](../v/value.md) exceeds the highest [value](../v/value.md) it has reached previously. This means if the [fund](../f/fund.md) incurs losses, the manager must recover those losses and surpass the previous peak [value](../v/value.md) before earning performance fees again.

2. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Protection**: By implementing a HWM, investors are protected from paying performance fees during periods of poor performance or recovery from losses. It aligns the interests of the [fund](../f/fund.md) managers with those of the investors, encouraging long-term performance over short-term gains.

3. **Comparison with Other Benchmarks**: Unlike relative benchmarks that compare a [fund](../f/fund.md)'s performance against an external [index](../i/index_instrument.md), the HWM is an absolute [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md). It is solely concerned with the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s historical performance.

### Calculation of High-Water Mark

The High-Water Mark is calculated based on the net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) (NAV) of the [fund](../f/fund.md) at specific intervals, commonly at the end of each month or quarter. Here's a simplified version of how it works:

1. **Initial NAV**: When an [investor](../i/investor.md) first enters the [fund](../f/fund.md), the NAV at the point of entry sets the initial HWM.
2. **Periodic NAV Assessment**: At the end of each performance period (usually a quarter or a year), the NAV is calculated.
3. **Comparison with Previous HWM**: This NAV is compared to the prior HWM. If it is higher, the current NAV sets the new HWM. If it is lower, the HWM remains [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md).
4. **Performance [Fee](../f/fee.md) Trigger**: Performance fees are only applicable if the current NAV exceeds the HWM. If the HWM is not surpassed, no performance [fee](../f/fee.md) is charged for that period.

### Real-World Application in Hedge Funds

In [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, the High-Water Mark is often coupled with a [hurdle rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md). The [hurdle rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md) is the minimum acceptable [return](../r/return.md) an [investor](../i/investor.md) expects before performance fees are charged. Here’s a portrayal of how this operates:

1. **Set [Hurdle Rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md)**: Assume the [hurdle rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md) is 5% annually.
2. **Calculate [Fund](../f/fund.md) NAV**: If the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s NAV is $100 million, a 5% [hurdle rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md) makes the target NAV $105 million for the next year.
3. **NAV Movements**: If the NAV reaches $108 million by year-end:
 - **Surpass HWM and [Hurdle Rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md)**: The [fund](../f/fund.md) has surpassed both the HWM and the [hurdle rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md).
 - **Performance [Fee](../f/fee.md) Eligibility**: The manager earns performance fees on the $3 million excess above the $105 million [hurdle rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md).
4. **Revised HWM**: The new HWM is set at $108 million.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of High-Water Marks

#### Advantages:
- **Aligns Interests**: It aligns the interests of [fund](../f/fund.md) managers with those of the investors by ensuring managers are motivated to recover losses and achieve consistent performance.
- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) [Assurance](../a/assurance.md)**: Investors are assured they won’t be charged performance fees during periods of recovery, only for actual gains beyond previous peaks.
- **Long-Term Focus**: Encourages a focus on long-term gains rather than short-term performance spikes.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Incentive Reduction**: In protracted periods of drawdowns or in volatile markets, managers may have diminished incentives if achieving new HWMs seems improbable.
- **Manager [Attrition](../a/attrition.md)**: Persistent underperformance leading to a significant gap between NAV and HWM might result in manager exit or [fund](../f/fund.md) [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).

### Case Study: Application in Leading Hedge Funds

One practical example is the [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) Renaissance Technologies. Renaissance Technologies, known for its Medallion [Fund](../f/fund.md), utilizes a HWM structure to maintain performance-driven incentives.

- **Renaissance Technologies High-Water Mark**:
 - **Medallion [Fund](../f/fund.md)**: Applies HWM alongside significant performance fees (often cited around 44%).
 - **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Protection**: Ensures that investors are only paying for net performance over the historical peak.

### Conclusion

Understanding the High-Water Mark is vital for both [fund](../f/fund.md) managers and investors. It serves as a crucial mechanism for performance evaluation and [fee](../f/fee.md) structuring within the [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) [industry](../i/industry.md). By ensuring fees are only paid on net positive performance beyond prior peaks, HWMs provide a fair and incentivizing framework that underpins the fiduciary relationship between investors and [fund](../f/fund.md) managers.
