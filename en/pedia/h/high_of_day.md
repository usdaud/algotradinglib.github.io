# High Of Day

The high of day is the highest traded price of a security during the current trading session. It is a common reference level for breakout and momentum strategies.

## Why it matters
- A break above the high of day can signal strong intraday momentum.
- The level often attracts stop orders and liquidity.
- It can serve as a resistance zone if price fails to break.

## Example
A stock trades between 40 and 41 for most of the morning. When price breaks above 41, a trader buys the breakout and places a stop just below the prior range.

## Practical notes
High of day levels are most relevant when volume is strong and the market environment supports momentum.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for High Of Day and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating High Of Day as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For High Of Day, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying High Of Day. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use High Of Day alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
