# Hit Rate

Hit rate is the percentage of decisions, signals, or trades that are correct or profitable. It is similar to win rate but can also apply to forecasting signals or model predictions.

## Calculation
Hit rate equals the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. In trading, success can mean a profitable trade, a correct directional call, or a signal that meets a predefined target.

## Use Cases
Hit rate is used to evaluate signal quality, model accuracy, and trade execution. It is often tracked alongside payoff ratio and profit factor to assess overall effectiveness.

## Interpretation
A high hit rate does not guarantee profitability. If losses are larger than gains, a strategy with a high hit rate can still lose money. Likewise, a low hit rate can be profitable if wins are significantly larger than losses.

## Limitations
Hit rate can be misleading when sample sizes are small or when outcomes are highly skewed. It should be paired with risk and return metrics to provide a complete view of performance.

## Conclusion
Hit rate is a useful diagnostic, but it is only one part of strategy evaluation. It should be interpreted in the context of payoff size and risk exposure.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Hit Rate and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Hit Rate as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Hit Rate, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Hit Rate. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Hit Rate alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
