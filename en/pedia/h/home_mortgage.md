# Home Mortgage

A [home](../h/home.md) [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is a [loan](../l/loan.md) provided by a [lender](../l/lender.md), typically a [bank](../b/bank.md) or other financial institution, to help a borrower purchase or [refinance](../r/refinance.md) a [home](../h/home.md) or other [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) property. This type of [loan](../l/loan.md) allows individuals to spread the cost of the [home](../h/home.md) over a period usually ranging from 15 to 30 years, making it more affordable compared to paying the full purchase price upfront. Mortgages involve the borrower pledging their [home](../h/home.md) as [collateral](../c/collateral.md). If the borrower fails to make the agreed-upon payments, the [lender](../l/lender.md) has the legal right to seize the property through a process called [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md).

## Types of Home Mortgages

### Fixed-Rate Mortgages

A [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md) maintains the same [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) ([principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md)) for the entire term of the [loan](../l/loan.md). This offers stability and predictability because the borrower's monthly payments do not change over time. Fixed-rate mortgages are typically available in 15-year and 30-year terms.

### Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARM)

An adjustable-rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) has an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that can change periodically based on changes in a corresponding financial [index](../i/index_instrument.md) that's associated with the [loan](../l/loan.md). Typically, the initial [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is fixed for a period of time, after which it adjusts annually. An ARM might be expressed as a 5/1 ARM, meaning it has a fixed rate for five years and then adjusts annually thereafter.

### Interest-Only Mortgages

[Interest](../i/interest.md)-only mortgages require the borrower to pay only the [interest](../i/interest.md) on the [loan](../l/loan.md) for a certain period (usually 5 to 10 years). After the [interest](../i/interest.md)-only period, the borrower must either pay off the [loan](../l/loan.md) (which might involve a [balloon payment](../b/balloon_payment.md)) or begin to pay both [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Balloon Mortgages

Balloon mortgages are loans in which the borrower must make a large [payment](../p/payment.md) at the end of the [loan](../l/loan.md) term. They often feature lower initial payments with the bulk of the [loan](../l/loan.md)'s [principal](../p/principal.md) repaid at the end.

## Mortgage Process

### Pre-Approval

The [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) pre-approval process involves a [lender](../l/lender.md) evaluating a borrower's financial background, including [credit score](../c/credit_score.md), [income](../i/income.md), debts, and assets. Pre-approval provides a conditional commitment for a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) amount and helps streamline the [home](../h/home.md) buying process.

### Application

Once pre-approved, the borrower fills out a formal [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) application. Detailed financial information [will](../w/will.md) be required, including employment history, [income](../i/income.md), and debts. The application process usually involves an extensive review by the [lender](../l/lender.md).

### Processing

During processing, the [lender](../l/lender.md) verifies the information provided by the borrower. This stage often involves ordering a [home](../h/home.md) [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md), examining property details, and confirming financial documents.

### Underwriting

[Underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) is a detailed assessment of the [risk](../r/risk.md) involved in the [loan](../l/loan.md). The [underwriter](../u/underwriter.md) [will](../w/will.md) evaluate the borrower's [credit](../c/credit.md) history, verify employment and [income](../i/income.md), and ensure all financial documentation is accurate. This step is critical in determining whether the [loan](../l/loan.md) [will](../w/will.md) be approved.

### Closing

Closing, also known as settlement, is the final step in the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) process. During closing, the borrower and [lender](../l/lender.md) sign all necessary legal documents, funds are disbursed, and ownership of the property is transferred.

## Key Mortgage Terms

### Principal

The [principal](../p/principal.md) is the amount of [money](../m/money.md) borrowed to buy the [home](../h/home.md) or take out against the [home](../h/home.md)'s [equity](../e/equity.md). Over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md), payments are made against both the [principal](../p/principal.md) and the [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Interest

[Interest](../i/interest.md) is the [fee](../f/fee.md) paid to the [lender](../l/lender.md) for borrowing the [money](../m/money.md). The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can be fixed or adjustable, profoundly affecting the overall cost of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).

### Amortization

Amortization refers to the process of paying off a [loan](../l/loan.md) over time through regular payments. With each [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), part of the amount goes towards reducing the [principal](../p/principal.md) and part goes towards paying [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Escrow

An [escrow](../e/escrow.md) account is set up by the [lender](../l/lender.md) to pay certain property-related expenses like property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and homeowner's [insurance](../i/insurance.md). Funds are typically collected monthly along with the [loan](../l/loan.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), then disbursed as needed.

### Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)

Private [Mortgage Insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) is a type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) that lenders may require for borrowers who contribute a [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) of less than 20% of the [home](../h/home.md)'s purchase price. PMI protects the [lender](../l/lender.md) if the borrower defaults on the [loan](../l/loan.md).

## Federal Assistance and Programs

Different programs and federal entities provide assistance to [home](../h/home.md) buyers and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) holders:

### Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Loans

FHA loans are government-insured loans designed to help lower-[income](../i/income.md) individuals buy homes. They typically [offer](../o/offer.md) lower [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) requirements and more flexible [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring criteria.

### Veterans Affairs (VA) Loans

VA loans are provided to eligible veterans, active service members, and certain members of the National Guard and Reserves. These loans often have favorable terms, including no [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) requirements and no private [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md).

### USDA Loans

USDA loans are backed by the United States Department of Agriculture for eligible rural homebuyers. These loans [offer](../o/offer.md) benefits such as zero [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) and lower [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) costs.

## Mortgage Refinance

Refinancing a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) involves replacing an existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) with a new one, often with different terms and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Homeowners [refinance](../r/refinance.md) to reduce monthly payments, take advantage of lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, consolidate [debt](../d/debt.md), or access [home equity](../h/home_equity.md).

### Cash-Out Refinance

A [cash-out refinance](../c/cash-out_refinance.md) replaces an existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) with a new [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) for more than the amount owed, and the borrower takes the difference in cash. This is often used for [home](../h/home.md) improvements or paying off higher [interest](../i/interest.md) debts.

### Rate and Term Refinance

Rate and term refinancing involves changing the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), the term of the [loan](../l/loan.md), or both, without receiving any additional cash at closing. This option typically aims to lower monthly payments or reduce the [loan](../l/loan.md) term.

## Economic Indicators Affecting Mortgages

Several [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) directly affect [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) rates and the housing [market](../m/market.md):

### Federal Reserve Policies

The Federal Reserve's [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and decisions about the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) can influence [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) rates. A lower [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) often leads to decreased [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) rates and vice versa.

### Inflation

[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates can impact [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) rates. Higher [inflation](../i/inflation.md) typically leads to higher [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) rates because lenders charge more to compensate for the reduced [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of future payments.

### Employment Rates

Employment rates affect the housing [market](../m/market.md)'s health and borrowers' ability to make [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments. Higher employment rates generally boost the housing [market](../m/market.md), leading to more favorable [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) conditions.
