# Hedge Fund Styles

Hedge fund styles describe broad categories of how funds pursue returns. Styles reflect the main drivers of risk and the typical instruments used.

## Major styles
- Equity hedge: long short equity with varying net exposure.
- Event driven: merger arbitrage, distressed, and special situations.
- Macro: discretionary or systematic trading across asset classes.
- Relative value: statistical arbitrage, fixed income arbitrage, or convertible arbitrage.
- Managed futures: trend following across futures markets.

## Why styles matter
Styles influence return patterns, drawdowns, and sensitivity to market conditions. Investors use style classifications to build diversified allocations.

## Example
A portfolio combines a market neutral equity hedge fund with a macro fund to reduce dependence on equity market direction.

## Practical note
Style definitions are not strict. Many funds blend styles or shift focus as opportunities change.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Hedge Fund Styles and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Hedge Fund Styles as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Hedge Fund Styles, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Hedge Fund Styles. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Hedge Fund Styles alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
