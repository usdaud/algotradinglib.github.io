# Harmonic Wave Patterns

Harmonic [wave patterns](../w/wave_patterns_in_trading.md) are a set of specific price movements that repeatedly occur in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These patterns are identified using [Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) and extension levels. Harmonic trading, developed by Scott Carney in the late 1990s, is based on the idea that [market](../m/market.md) movements are harmonic in nature and that they conform to specific patterns dictated by Fibonacci ratios. [Harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md) are predictive by nature, as opposed to reactive, [offering](../o/offering.md) traders an advance warning of a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) in price. 

## Introduction to Harmonic Patterns

### The Concept of Harmonic Trading

Harmonic trading integrates the use of Fibonacci sequences to identify potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points with high precision. The primary premise is that [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md), which are geometric structures, adhere to predefined rules and ratios to predict future price movements.

### The Importance of Fibonacci Ratios

Fibonacci ratios, such as 0.618, 1.618, 2.618, etc., are integral to [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md). These ratios arise from the Fibonacci sequence and are crucial for identifying potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) zones in [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md).

## Types of Harmonic Patterns

There are several [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md), each with intricate rules and specific Fibonacci ratio relationships. The following are some of the most commonly used [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md):

### The Gartley Pattern

Developed by H.M. Gartley in 1935, the [Gartley pattern](../g/gartley_pattern.md) is one of the most recognized [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md). It identifies potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) zones based on Fibonacci levels.

**Key Points of [Gartley Pattern](../g/gartley_pattern.md):**
- **AB = CD**: The BC [leg](../l/leg.md) retraces 61.8% of the AB [leg](../l/leg.md).
- **XA [Retracement](../r/retracement.md)**: Points B and D are significant Fibonacci levels: typically, point B is at 61.8% of XA, and point D is at 78.6% of XA.
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target**: Often set at the 61.8% [retracement](../r/retracement.md) of the AD [leg](../l/leg.md).

### Bat Pattern

Introduced by Scott Carney, the Bat pattern is another popular harmonic pattern. Its structure is similar to the Gartley but with different Fibonacci levels.

**Key Points of Bat Pattern:**
- **AB = CD**: The BC [leg](../l/leg.md) retraces 38.2% or 50% of the AB [leg](../l/leg.md).
- **XA [Retracement](../r/retracement.md)**: Points B and D are significant Fibonacci levels: point B at 38.2% or 50% of XA, and point D is at 88.6% of XA.
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target**: Commonly set at the 61.8% [retracement](../r/retracement.md) of the AD [leg](../l/leg.md).

### Butterfly Pattern

The Butterfly pattern, also developed by Carney, contains key Fibonacci measurements differing from both the Gartley and Bat patterns.

**Key Points of Butterfly Pattern:**
- **AB = CD**: The BC [leg](../l/leg.md) retraces 38.2% or 88.6% of the AB [leg](../l/leg.md).
- **XA [Retracement](../r/retracement.md)**: The D point extends beyond the initial XA [leg](../l/leg.md), typically reaching 127.2% or 161.8% of XA.
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target**: Often set at the 61.8% [retracement](../r/retracement.md) of the AD [leg](../l/leg.md).

### Crab Pattern

The Crab pattern is an advanced harmonic pattern also introduced by Carney. It hosts some of the most precise Fibonacci alignments among [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md).

**Key Points of Crab Pattern:**
- **AB = CD**: The BC [leg](../l/leg.md) retraces 38.2% or 61.8% of the AB [leg](../l/leg.md).
- **XA [Retracement](../r/retracement.md)**: Point D extends beyond XA, typically 161.8% of XA.
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target**: Commonly placed at the 61.8% [retracement](../r/retracement.md) of the AD [leg](../l/leg.md).

### Cypher Pattern

The Cypher pattern is one of the less commonly discussed but still highly effective [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md).

**Key Points of Cypher Pattern:**
- **AB = CD**: The BC [leg](../l/leg.md) retraces 38.2% or 61.8% of the AB [leg](../l/leg.md).
- **XA [Retracement](../r/retracement.md)**: The C point retraces up to 27.2% or 38.2% of XA.
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target**: Often at the 78.6% [retracement](../r/retracement.md) of the XC [leg](../l/leg.md).

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md) can enhance decision-making processes. Using an algorithm to identify these patterns allows traders to automate their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) based on predefined rules.

### Algorithms and Harmonic Patterns

Several algorithms can be used to recognize and [trade](../t/trade.md) [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md), incorporating [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and [pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) techniques.

#### Pattern Recognition Algorithms

[Pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) algorithms play a crucial role in detecting [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md). These algorithms scan historical price data for specific Fibonacci retracements and extensions.

*Examples of [Pattern Recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) Libraries:*
- **Harmonic Pattern Scanner**: [Software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) like the harmonic pattern scanner employ sophisticated algorithms to detect [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md) in real-time.

### Backtesting Harmonic Patterns

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) involves testing a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) on historical data to evaluate performance. Algorithmic traders backtest [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md) to determine their accuracy in predicting [market](../m/market.md) reversals.

**Steps in [Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md):**
1. **Identify a pattern**: Use historical price data to find instances of [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md).
2. **Apply [trading rules](../t/trading_rules.md)**: Define entry and exit rules based on the identified patterns.
3. **Evaluate performance**: Analyze metrics such as win rate, [profit factor](../p/profit_factor.md), etc.

### Risk Management

Effective integration of [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md) into an [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategy requires rigorous [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). 

**[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) Techniques:**
- **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Determine [trade](../t/trade.md) size based on [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).
- **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Place [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) at strategic Fibonacci levels to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Real-world Examples

Various financial institutions and trading firms [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [harmonic patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md) as part of their [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies.

*Examples of Firms Utilizing [Harmonic Patterns](../h/harmonic_patterns.md):*
