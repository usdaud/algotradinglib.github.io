# Return

In the realms of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, the concept of "return" is perhaps one of the most critical and multi-faceted metrics used to evaluate the performance of an investment. Return represents the [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss generated from an investment over a specified period, expressed typically as a percentage of the initial investment amount. The return can be calculated for various financial instruments, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, mutual funds, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and even entire portfolios.

## Types of Return

Understanding the different types of returns is essential for investors and traders alike. Various forms of return capture different aspects of investment performance.

### Absolute Return

[Absolute return](../a/absolute_return.md) refers to the amount of [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss that an investment generates over a specific period. It does not take into account the performance of the [market](../m/market.md) or other benchmarks. [Absolute return](../a/absolute_return.md) is often used to measure the [value added](../v/value_added.md) by a strategy.

### Relative Return

Relative return measures the performance of an investment compared to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) or [index](../i/index.md). For example, if an investment returns 10% while a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md) returns 8%, the relative return is 2%. This type of return helps investors understand whether their investment outperformed or underperformed the [market](../m/market.md).

### Annualized Return

Annualized return is a hypothetical [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) that, if achieved every year, would produce the same cumulative result as the actual returns over a period. It converts the returns of any period into an annual equivalent. It is especially useful for comparing the performance of investments with different time horizons.

### Risk-Adjusted Return

[Risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) accounts for the [risk](../r/risk.md) taken to achieve a certain level of return. Common metrics include the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), which measures return per unit of [risk](../r/risk.md), and the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md), which considers [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md). These measures are essential for evaluating the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of an investment.

### Expected Return

[Expected return](../e/expected_return.md) is a probabilistic measure that estimates the [average return](../a/average_return.md) that an [investor](../i/investor.md) can expect to earn from an investment, based on historical data or models. It is useful for planning and setting investment goals.

## Methods of Calculation

There are several formulas and methods to calculate different types of returns depending on the investment instrument and the context.

### Simple Return

The simplest way to calculate the return on an investment is to use the formula:

\[ \text{Return (\%)} = \frac{\text{Ending [Value](../v/value.md)} - \text{Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)}}{\text{Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)}} \times 100 \]

For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a stock for $100 and sells it for $120, the return would be:

\[ \frac{120 - 100}{100} \times 100 = 20\% \]

### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

CAGR is used to describe the geometric progression of an investment over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) periods. The formula is:

\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{\text{Ending [Value](../v/value.md)}}{\text{Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

Where \( n \) is the number of years.

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

IRR is an advanced metric used to estimate the profitability of potential investments. The IRR is the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) that makes the net [present value](../p/present_value.md) (NPV) of an investment zero. Calculating IRR often requires software due to its iterative nature.

### Total Return

[Total return](../t/total_return.md) includes all sources of [income](../i/income.md) generated from an investment, such as dividends, [interest](../i/interest.md), and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains. It is commonly used for investments in [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-paying [stocks](../s/stock.md).

\[ \text{[Total Return](../t/total_return.md) (\%)} = \frac{\text{Ending [Value](../v/value.md)} + \text{Dividends}}{\text{Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)}} - 1 \]

## Role in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), return metrics enable traders to evaluate the performance of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) or automated strategies. [Performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) may include raw returns, annualized returns, and [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

### Backtesting

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) involves running a trading algorithm on historical data to evaluate its past performance. Key return metrics help in understanding how the algorithm would have performed, providing valuable insights for [optimization](../o/optimization.md).

### Hyperparameter Tuning

In machine learning-based [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), hyperparameter tuning involves optimizing parameters to achieve the best possible return. Metrics such as [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) and annualized return are crucial in this process.

## Fintech Applications

Fintech companies [leverage](../l/leverage.md) advanced technologies to provide innovative solutions for return calculations, [investment analysis](../i/investment_analysis.md), and [portfolio management](../p/par.md).

### Robo-Advisors

Robo-advisors like [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com) and [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com) use algorithms to manage portfolios and optimize returns based on the client's [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md).

### Investment Platforms

Platforms like [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com) and [Acorns](https://www.acorns.com) [offer](../o/offer.md) users easy access to investment opportunities while providing tools to track return metrics. They often display [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md), expected returns, and [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns to help users make informed decisions.

## Conclusion

Return serves as a cornerstone metric in [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, [offering](../o/offering.md) a comprehensive view of an investment's performance. By understanding the various types of returns and methods of calculation, investors and traders can make more informed decisions, optimize strategies, and better manage their portfolios.
