# Relative Momentum Index (RMI)

The relative momentum index is a momentum oscillator that extends the RSI by using price changes over a longer interval rather than one period. It aims to filter noise and highlight more sustained momentum.

## Formula outline
- Choose a momentum period m and a smoothing period n.
- Compute upward and downward price changes over m periods.
- Apply an RSI style calculation to those changes.

## Interpretation
Values above 70 often indicate overbought conditions, while values below 30 indicate oversold conditions, though thresholds vary by asset and timeframe.

## Example
A trader uses m = 5 and n = 14. The RMI crosses above 50 after a pullback, suggesting momentum is turning higher.

## Practical notes
RMI is often used with trend filters to avoid trading against strong trends.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Relative Momentum Index (RMI) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Relative Momentum Index (RMI) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Relative Momentum Index (RMI), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Relative Momentum Index (RMI). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Relative Momentum Index (RMI) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
