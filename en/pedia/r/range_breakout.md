# Range Breakout

A range breakout occurs when price moves outside a defined trading range, often signaling a transition from consolidation to trend. Breakouts can be bullish or bearish.

## Key elements
- A clear range with multiple tests of support and resistance.
- A decisive move beyond the boundary.
- Increased volume or momentum confirmation.

## Example
A stock consolidates between 40 and 43. It closes above 43 with strong volume, indicating a breakout. Traders may enter long with a stop back inside the range.

## Risks
False breakouts are common. Confirmation and risk controls help manage failed signals.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Range Breakout and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Range Breakout as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Range Breakout, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Range Breakout. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Range Breakout alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
