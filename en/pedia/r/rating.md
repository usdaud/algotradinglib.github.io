# Rating

[Credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) is a quantified assessment of the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of a borrower in general terms or with respect to a particular [debt](../d/debt.md) or financial obligation. It is an evaluation made by [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies of a potential debtor's ability to repay the [debt](../d/debt.md), and an implicit forecast of the likelihood of the debtor defaulting. A [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) can be assigned to any entity that seeks to borrow [money](../m/money.md)—an individual, [corporation](../c/corporation.md), state or provincial authority, or sovereign government.

[Credit](../c/credit.md) ratings are determined by closely studying and evaluating the financial history of these entities and summarizing it in the form of scores or grades. Ratings can affect [interest](../i/interest.md) rates applied to loans and securities, terms of the [loan](../l/loan.md), and the capacity of the entity to acquire new funds.

## Overview and Importance

[Credit](../c/credit.md) ratings are pivotal in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) because they provide a global standard that helps investors make informed decisions. They are broadly classified into two categories:

- **Investment Grades**: These ratings indicate a low to moderate [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).
- **Junk Grades**: These are used to indicate a higher [risk](../r/risk.md) of [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) or [default](../d/default.md).

Prominent [Credit Rating](../c/credit_rating.md) Agencies (CRAs) include:

1. **Moody's Investors Service** - Moody's
2. **Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings** - S&P Global
3. **[Fitch Ratings](../f/fitch_ratings.md)** - Fitch Ratings

These entities use a combination of qualitative and quantitative assessments to reach a [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md).

### Types of Credit Ratings

1. **[Credit Rating](../c/credit_rating.md) of Corporations**

 Corporate [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings assess the financial stability and [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of companies. Ratings play a fundamental role in [debt](../d/debt.md) issuance decisions by corporations, impacting the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates they incur on issued bonds.

2. **Sovereign [Credit](../c/credit.md) Ratings**

 These ratings concern the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of a country. Factors influencing sovereign ratings include [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), political stability, and fiscal policies. Sovereign ratings affect countries' borrowing terms on international markets.

3. **Individual [Credit](../c/credit.md) Ratings**

 This pertains to ratings given to individuals, primarily involved in [consumer credit](../c/consumer_credit.md)-related activities. Individual [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings are often based on a [FICO score](../f/fico_score.md) or other [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models.

## Factors Affecting Credit Ratings

The primary factors influencing [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings include:

- **Economic Climate**
 [Economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) such as GDP growth, [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates significantly impact [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings.

- **[Financial Health](../f/financial_health.md)**
 Historical [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md), balance sheets, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [debt](../d/debt.md) levels are fundamental indicators.

- **Management Quality**
 The management's capability and potential to navigate [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and run the entity profitably.

- **[Industry](../i/industry.md) Position**
 [Market share](../m/market_share.md), competitive edge, and operational risks inherent in the particular [industry](../i/industry.md).

- **Political Stability**
 Especially relevant for sovereign ratings, political risks and stability can substantially affect [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md).

## Methodology and Rating Process

Each [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agency has its proprietary methodology, which generally involves:

1. **Request for Rating**
 An entity requests the agency to provide a rating service.

2. **Information Collection**
 The agency gathers financial data, management interviews, and other relevant information.

3. **Analysis**
 This involves scrutinizing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), conducting an [industry analysis](../i/industry_analysis.md), and using [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md).

4. **Rating Committee**
 An internal committee reviews the analysis and decides on the rating.

5. **Publication/Notification**
 The entity is informed of the rating decision, and it is subsequently published by the agency.

## Risks and Limitations

[Credit](../c/credit.md) ratings are not infallible and come with inherent risks and limitations:

- **Subjectivity**: Despite standardized models, some degree of subjectivity remains.
- **[Economic Cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md)**: Ratings may not timely reflect changing [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).
- **Conflicts of [Interest](../i/interest.md)**: Potential conflicts arise if rating agencies also [offer](../o/offer.md) consulting services to the rated entities.
- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md) Issues**: Lack of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the rating models and criteria used can affect credibility.

## Rating Scales and Symbols

Various agencies use different scales and symbols to denote [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings. For instance, Standard & Poor's and [Fitch Ratings](../f/fitch_ratings.md) typically use a scale from [AAA](../a/aaa.md) to D, where [AAA](../a/aaa.md) indicates the highest [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) and D represents [default](../d/default.md). Moody's employs a different notation such as [Aaa](../a/aaa.md), Aa1, Aa2, etc.

## Conclusion

[Credit](../c/credit.md) ratings serve as critical financial tools that aid investors and institutions in decision-making. They provide a snapshot of the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) associated with an entity and therefore greatly influence borrowing costs, terms, and investment strategies. Despite the challenges and limitations, [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings play an indispensable role in the operation of modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
