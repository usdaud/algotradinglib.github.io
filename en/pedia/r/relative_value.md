# Relative Value

Relative [Value](../v/value.md) (RV), also known as [Relative Value Arbitrage](../r/relative_value_arbitrage.md), is a type of [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) employed primarily by [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) desks, and other sophisticated investors. This strategy involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between related financial instruments. The goal is to identify and exploit these discrepancies without taking on excessive overall [market risk](../m/market_risk.md). Rather than betting on the direction of the [market](../m/market.md) (be it [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, [bond](../b/bond.md) markets, or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets), [relative value arbitrage](../r/relative_value_arbitrage.md) aims to exploit mispricings between different securities that should theoretically maintain a certain relationship with one another.

## History and Evolution of Relative Value

Relative [value](../v/value.md) strategies have their roots in classic [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), a financial practice dating back centuries where traders sought to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price differences between markets. As [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) became more sophisticated and interconnected, [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md) became harder to find. This led to the development of more complex strategies focused on relative [value](../v/value.md) across various financial instruments.

The strategy gained significant recognition and popularity in the 1990s, with the rise of [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds like Long-Term [Capital](../c/capital.md) Management (LTCM), which famously used relative [value](../v/value.md) strategies before its collapse in 1998. The LTCM debacle highlighted the risks associated with [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in [relative value arbitrage](../r/relative_value_arbitrage.md), but it also demonstrated the potential returns from this strategy, leading to its continued use and evolution in the financial [industry](../i/industry.md).

## Key Concepts in Relative Value

### Market Neutrality

One of the fundamental principles of relative [value](../v/value.md) strategies is [market](../m/market.md) neutrality. The objective is to structure trades in a way that profits from price discrepancies without being exposed to the broader [market](../m/market.md) movements. For example, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) believes that Stock A is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) compared to Stock B, they might go long on Stock A and short on Stock B. Whether the [market](../m/market.md) moves up or down, the relative [value](../v/value.md) between Stock A and Stock B is where the [profit](../p/profit.md) potential lies.

### Pairs Trading

[Pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md) is a common form of relative [value](../v/value.md) strategy where two correlated assets are traded against each other. By identifying pairs of [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or other financial instruments that have historically moved together, traders can take a long position on the underperforming [asset](../a/asset.md) and a short position on the outperforming one. The assumption is that the prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical relationship, allowing the [trader](../t/trader.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the convergence.

### Spread Trading

[Spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md) involves taking positions on the spread between two closely related financial instruments. This can be observed in various markets such as [futures](../f/futures.md), [options](../o/options.md), and [bond](../b/bond.md) markets. For example, in the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md), traders might look at the spread between two different months of the same [commodity](../c/commodity.md) contract. In the [bond market](../b/bond_market.md), they might focus on the [yield spread](../y/yield_spread.md) between government bonds of different maturities.

### Statistical Arbitrage

Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) (or "stat arb") is a type of relative [value](../v/value.md) strategy that uses [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and quantitative techniques to identify price discrepancies between related instruments. Stat arb strategies often involve high-frequency trading, where sophisticated algorithms execute thousands of trades within fractions of a second. These models might look at historical price relationships, [volatility](../v/volatility.md) patterns, and other statistical metrics to identify opportunities.

### Convertible Arbitrage

[Convertible arbitrage](../c/convertible_arbitrage.md) involves taking positions in both a company's convertible securities (like convertible bonds) and the company's [equity](../e/equity.md). The strategy typically involves going long on the convertible bonds and short on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock. The [trade](../t/trade.md) profits from the price discrepancy between the [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) and the stock, while also benefiting from any embedded [options](../o/options.md) in the convertible [security](../s/security.md).

## Implementing Relative Value Strategies

### Data Analysis

Data analysis is critical in implementing relative [value](../v/value.md) strategies. Traders rely on historical data to identify [price patterns](../p/price_patterns.md), correlations, and [spreads](../s/spreads.md). This involves the use of sophisticated software and algorithms to process large datasets and identify opportunities. [Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) are increasingly being used to improve [data analysis techniques](../d/data_analysis_techniques.md) in this space.

### Quantitative Models

[Quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) are at the heart of many relative [value](../v/value.md) strategies. These models use statistical and mathematical methods to predict price movements and identify mispricings. Common modeling techniques include [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md), [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) models, and copula models, which analyze correlations and dependencies between assets.

### Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial in relative [value](../v/value.md) trading. While the strategy aims to minimize [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md), it is not without [risk](../r/risk.md). [Liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md), [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), and [model risk](../m/model_risk.md) are some of the key concerns. Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) involves setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), diversifying positions, and continuously monitoring [market](../m/market.md) conditions and model performance.

### Execution

[Execution](../e/execution.md) is a critical component of relative [value](../v/value.md) trading. Due to the often small price discrepancies being exploited, the ability to execute trades quickly and at low cost is vital. This is where technology plays a significant role, with high-frequency trading platforms and direct [market](../m/market.md) access being essential tools for many relative [value](../v/value.md) traders.

## Applications of Relative Value Strategies

### Equity Markets

In [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, relative [value](../v/value.md) strategies can involve [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), sector [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), and [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) trading. [Pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), as mentioned earlier, involves taking long and short positions in two correlated [stocks](../s/stock.md). Sector [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) focuses on exploiting price discrepancies within a sector, while [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) trading involves taking positions based on the differences in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) among [stocks](../s/stock.md) in an [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Fixed Income

In [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) markets, relative [value](../v/value.md) strategies might involve [yield curve](../y/yard.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), [credit spread](../c/credit_spread.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), and treasury [futures](../f/futures.md) [basis](../b/basis.md) trading. [Yield curve](../y/yard.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) exploits differences in yields along the [treasury yield](../t/treasury_yield.md) curve. [Credit spread](../c/credit_spread.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking positions on the spread between corporate bonds and [risk](../r/risk.md)-free government bonds. Treasury [futures](../f/futures.md) [basis](../b/basis.md) trading looks at the difference between the price of treasury [futures](../f/futures.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) cash treasury bonds.

### Derivatives Markets

In [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets, relative [value](../v/value.md) strategies can involve [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), and swaps. Option [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) might involve strategies like the [put-call parity](../p/put-call_parity.md), where traders exploit the relationship between the prices of puts, calls, and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock. [Futures arbitrage](../f/futures_arbitrage.md) can involve inter-[commodity](../c/commodity.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) or calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md). [Swap](../s/swap.md) spread [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) looks at the difference between the fixed rate of a [swap](../s/swap.md) and the [yield](../y/yield.md) of treasury securities.

### Commodity Markets

In [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets, traders might look at the spread between different grades of the same [commodity](../c/commodity.md), the spread between different [commodity futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) contracts, or the spread between the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) and the [futures](../f/futures.md) price of a [commodity](../c/commodity.md). For example, in the oil [market](../m/market.md), traders might look at the spread between Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude.

### Foreign Exchange

In [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) markets, relative [value](../v/value.md) strategies can involve [currency](../c/currency.md) [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), [triangular arbitrage](../t/triangular_arbitrage.md), and [interest rate parity](../i/interest_rate_parity.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). [Currency](../c/currency.md) [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md) involves taking positions on the relative [value](../v/value.md) of two currencies. [Triangular arbitrage](../t/triangular_arbitrage.md) exploits price discrepancies between three currencies in the forex [market](../m/market.md). [Interest rate parity](../i/interest_rate_parity.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves exploiting differences in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates between two countries while hedging the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Advantages and Challenges of Relative Value Strategies
