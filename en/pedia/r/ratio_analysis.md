# Ratio Analysis

Ratio analysis is a quantitative method of analyzing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) to evaluate a company's performance, stability, and profitability by comparing different line items in the financial reports. These ratios help in understanding the company's [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), profitability, and [solvency](../s/solvency.md). This method is essential for stakeholders, including investors, creditors, and management, as it provides insights into the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and prospects of an organization.

## Types of Ratios

### Liquidity Ratios

[Liquidity ratios](../l/liquidity_ratios.md) measure a company's ability to meet its short-term [obligations](../o/obligation.md). They indicate the ease with which a company can convert its assets into cash without impacting its operational capability.

1. **[Current Ratio](../c/current_ratio.md)**
    \[
    \text{[Current Ratio](../c/current_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{[Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md)}}{\text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}}
    \]
    A ratio higher than 1 signifies that the company has more [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) than [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md), suggesting good short-term [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

2. **[Quick Ratio](../q/quick_ratio.md) ([Acid-Test Ratio](../a/acid-test_ratio.md))**
    \[
    \text{[Quick Ratio](../q/quick_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{[Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md)} - \text{[Inventory](../i/inventory.md)}}{\text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}}
    \]
    This ratio is a more stringent test of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) as it excludes [inventory](../i/inventory.md), which may not be as easily converted to cash.

3. **[Cash Ratio](../c/cash_ratio.md)**
    \[
    \text{[Cash Ratio](../c/cash_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Cash and [Cash Equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md)}}{\text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}}
