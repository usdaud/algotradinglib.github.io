# Ratio Analysis

Ratio analysis is a quantitative method of analyzing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) to evaluate a company's performance, stability, and profitability by comparing different line items in the financial reports. These ratios help in understanding the company's [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), profitability, and [solvency](../s/solvency.md). This method is essential for stakeholders, including investors, creditors, and management, as it provides insights into the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and prospects of an organization.

## Types of Ratios

### Liquidity Ratios

[Liquidity ratios](../l/liquidity_ratios.md) measure a company's ability to meet its short-term [obligations](../o/obligation.md). They indicate the ease with which a company can convert its assets into cash without impacting its operational capability.

1. **[Current Ratio](../c/current_ratio.md)**
 \[
 \text{[Current Ratio](../c/current_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{[Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md)}}{\text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}}
 \]
 A ratio higher than 1 signifies that the company has more [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) than [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md), suggesting good short-term [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

2. **[Quick Ratio](../q/quick_ratio.md) ([Acid-Test Ratio](../a/acid-test_ratio.md))**
 \[
 \text{[Quick Ratio](../q/quick_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{[Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md)} - \text{[Inventory](../i/inventory.md)}}{\text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}}
 \]
 This ratio is a more stringent test of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) as it excludes [inventory](../i/inventory.md), which may not be as easily converted to cash.

3. **[Cash Ratio](../c/cash_ratio.md)**
 \[
 \text{[Cash Ratio](../c/cash_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Cash and [Cash Equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md)}}{\text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}}
 \]
 This ratio focuses solely on the most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets, ensuring the company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities immediately.

### Profitability Ratios

[Profitability ratios](../p/profitability_ratios.md) evaluate a company's ability to generate [earnings](../e/earnings.md) relative to sales, assets, [equity](../e/equity.md), and other metrics. These ratios are crucial for assessing the company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) over the long term.

1. **[Gross Profit Margin](../g/gross_profit_margin.md)**
 \[
 \text{[Gross Profit Margin](../g/gross_profit_margin.md)} = \frac{\text{[Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md)}}{\text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}} \times 100
 \]
 This ratio shows the percentage of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS), indicating the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of production.

2. **[Operating Profit](../o/operating_profit.md) [Margin](../m/margin.md)**
 \[
 \text{[Operating Profit](../o/operating_profit.md) [Margin](../m/margin.md)} = \frac{\text{[Operating Income](../o/operating_income.md)}}{\text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}} \times 100
 \]

3. **[Net Profit Margin](../n/net_profit_margin.md)**
 \[
 \text{[Net Profit Margin](../n/net_profit_margin.md)} = \frac{\text{Net [Income](../i/income.md)}}{\text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}} \times 100
 \]
 This ratio indicates the percentage of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) remaining after all expenses, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and costs have been deducted, reflecting overall profitability.

4. **[Return on Assets](../r/return_on_assets_(roa).md) (ROA)**
 \[
 \text{ROA} = \frac{\text{Net [Income](../i/income.md)}}{\text{Total Assets}} \times 100
 \]
 ROA measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate [profit](../p/profit.md).

5. **[Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROE)**
 \[
 \text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net [Income](../i/income.md)}}{\text{[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md)'s [Equity](../e/equity.md)}} \times 100
 \]
 ROE indicates the [return](../r/return.md) generated on shareholders' investments, showcasing [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) from the shareholders' perspective.

### Leverage Ratios

[Leverage ratios](../l/leverage_ratios.md) assess the degree to which a company is utilizing borrowed [money](../m/money.md). They help understand the [financial structure](../f/financial_structure.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) levels associated with the company's [capital](../c/capital.md).

1. **[Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Equity](../e/equity.md) Ratio**
 \[
 \text{[Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Equity](../e/equity.md) Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total [Debt](../d/debt.md)}}{\text{Total [Equity](../e/equity.md)}}
 \]
 This ratio reveals the proportion of company [financing](../f/financing.md) coming from creditors versus shareholders, indicating financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md).

2. **[Debt Ratio](../d/debt_ratio.md)**
 \[
 \text{[Debt Ratio](../d/debt_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Total [Debt](../d/debt.md)}}{\text{Total Assets}}

 This measures the percentage of a company's assets that are financed by [debt](../d/debt.md) and indicates the reliance on borrowing for [asset](../a/asset.md) purchases.

3. **[Interest Coverage Ratio](../i/interest_coverage_ratio.md)**
 \[
 \text{[Interest Coverage Ratio](../i/interest_coverage_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Before [Interest](../i/interest.md) and [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) (EBIT)}}{\text{[Interest Expense](../i/interest_expense.md)}}
 \]
 This ratio determines how easily a company can pay [interest](../i/interest.md) on outstanding [debt](../d/debt.md) from its operational [income](../i/income.md).

### Efficiency Ratios

[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) ratios, also known as [activity ratios](../a/activity_ratios.md), measure how well a company utilizes its assets and manages its operations. These ratios help in assessing [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and management effectiveness.

1. **[Asset Turnover Ratio](../a/asset_turnover_ratio.md)**
 \[
 \text{[Asset Turnover Ratio](../a/asset_turnover_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}}{\text{Total Assets}}
 \]
 This ratio evaluates how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.

2. **[Inventory Turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) Ratio**
 \[

 \]
 This measures how many times a company’s [inventory](../i/inventory.md) is sold and replaced over a period.

3. **[Receivables Turnover Ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md)**
 \[
 \text{[Receivables Turnover Ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}}{\text{Average Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md)}}
 \]
 This ratio evaluates how effectively the company collects receivables from customers.

4. **Payables [Turnover Ratio](../t/turnover_ratio.md)**
 \[
 \text{Payables [Turnover Ratio](../t/turnover_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Accounts Payable}}
 \]
 This indicates how quickly a company pays off its suppliers.

### Market Valuation Ratios

[Market](../m/market.md) [valuation ratios](../v/valuation_ratios.md) provide insights into the [market](../m/market.md) perception of a company's [equity](../e/equity.md), assessing how well the stock is performing and valuing its profitability and growth potential.

1. **Price-[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Ratio (P/E Ratio)**
 \[
 \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md) per Share}}{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) per Share (EPS)}}
 \]
 This ratio indicates how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of [earnings](../e/earnings.md), reflecting [market](../m/market.md) expectations about the company's growth prospects.

2. **Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio)**
 \[
 \text{P/B Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md) per Share}}{\text{[Book Value](../b/book_value.md) per Share}}
 \]
 This measures the [market](../m/market.md) [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of a company relative to its [book value](../b/book_value.md).

3. **[Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)**
 \[
 \text{[Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md) per Share}} \times 100
 \]
 This ratio shows the annual dividends received as a percentage of the stock price, indicating [income](../i/income.md) generation for shareholders.

4. **[Earnings Yield](../e/earnings_yield.md)**
