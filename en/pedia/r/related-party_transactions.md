# Related-Party Transactions

Related-party transactions (RPTs) are transactions that occur between two parties who have a pre-existing relationship. These transactions can take many forms, including sales, leases, transfers of real or [personal property](../p/personal_property.md), services, and arrangements such as loans, guarantees, or other financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md). The existence of a relationship between the parties involved introduces a potential [conflict of interest](../c/conflict_of_interest.md), and the terms of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) may not reflect those applicable to independent parties.

## Definition and Types

### Definition
A related-party [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is defined by various standards and regulations. In general, a related party can be individuals or entities that have control, [joint](../j/joint.md) control, or significant influence over the reporting entity, or who are members of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or its parent. This can include family members, subsidiaries, associates, [joint](../j/joint.md) ventures, and key executives.

### Types of Related-Party Transactions
1. **Sales and Purchases:** Transactions involving the [sale](../s/sale.md) or purchase of goods and services.
2. **Leases:** Leasing properties or equipment to or from related parties.
3. **Transfers of Property:** Transferring assets between related entities.
4. **Loans and Guarantees:** Providing loans to or securing them for related parties.
5. **[Expense](../e/expense.md) Sharing:** Shared services or [joint](../j/joint.md) advertising campaigns among related entities.
6. **Employment Contracts:** Compensation agreements involving key management personnel.

## Reasons for Related-Party Transactions

RPTs can occur for legitimate [business](../b/business.md) reasons:
1. **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md):** Utilizing established relationships can facilitate better terms, faster negotiations, and mutual [trust](../t/trust.md).
2. **Strategic Alignment:** Aligning [business](../b/business.md) operations and strategies to achieve corporate objectives.
3. **Resource Allocation:** Efficient use of resources across related entities, providing benefits like cost savings.
4. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Spreading [risk](../r/risk.md) across related parties through [joint](../j/joint.md) ventures or financial guarantees.

## Risks and Concerns

Despite their potential benefits, RPTs also introduce significant risks:
1. **[Conflict of Interest](../c/conflict_of_interest.md):** The [transaction](../t/transaction.md) terms might not be as stringent as they would be with independent parties.
2. **[Fair Value](../f/fair_value.md) Concerns:** Doubts about whether the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) was conducted at fair [market value](../m/market_value.md).
3. **Financial Reporting:** These transactions can complicate [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), misleading stakeholders regarding the company's performance and [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).
4. **Regulatory Scrutiny:** There is considerable regulatory scrutiny to ensure such transactions are disclosed properly and are fair.

## Regulations and Standards

### International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
IFRS requires entities to disclose information about related-party relationships and transactions. IFRS 24 outlines:
- The identification of related parties.
- [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of terms and nature of transactions.
- Balances outstanding between related parties.

### Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
Both US GAAP and other national GAAPs provide specific requirements for the [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of related-party transactions. For instance, US GAAP requires entities to disclose material related-party transactions and the nature of the relationships, providing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) to users of [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

### Regulatory Bodies
Regulatory bodies such as the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) in the United States mandate detailed disclosures to ensure that investors are aware of the financial implications of these transactions.

## Disclosure Requirements

[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements typically involve:
1. **Identification of Related Parties:** A clear identification of entities considered related.
2. **Nature of Transactions:** The nature and extent of transactions carried out.
3. **Balances Outstanding:** Any outstanding balances, including terms and conditions, settlement, and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plans.
4. **Impact on [Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md):** Explanation of how these transactions affect the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and performance of the reporting entity.

## Best Practices

1. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** Full, clear [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of all related-party transactions.
2. **Independent Review:** Having an independent committee review and approve RPTs.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Terms:** Ensuring that transactions are conducted at arm’s length terms wherever possible.
4. **Regular Monitoring:** Consistent monitoring and auditing of RPTs to identify and mitigate any potential issues.

## Case Studies

### Enron
A well-known example of the misuse of related-party transactions was seen in the Enron scandal. The company used complex RPTs to hide losses and inflate profitability, leading to one of the most infamous corporate collapses and subsequent [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md).

### Apple
Apple Inc. is noted for its stringent policies on related-party transactions, [offering](../o/offering.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in its financial disclosures, and ensuring [stakeholder](../s/stakeholder.md) confidence through detailed reporting in its annual [proxy](../p/proxy.md) statements.

For in-depth review, see Apple’s [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and [proxy](../p/proxy.md) statements on their public materials.

## Conclusion

Related-party transactions can provide efficiencies and strategic advantages but must be approached with caution due to potential conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md) and regulatory concerns. Comprehensive policies, independent reviews, and complete [transparency](../t/transparency.md) are paramount in managing these transactions effectively to maintain fiduciary responsibility and [stakeholder](../s/stakeholder.md) [trust](../t/trust.md).

By adhering to standards like IFRS and GAAP, and following [best practices](../b/best_practices.md), entities can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) related-party transactions for legitimate [business](../b/business.md) gains while ensuring compliance and integrity in financial reporting.
