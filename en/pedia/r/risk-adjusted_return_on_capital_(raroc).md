# Risk-Adjusted Return On Capital (RAROC)

[Risk-Adjusted Return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) on [Capital](../c/capital.md) (RAROC) is a financial metric used to assess the profitability of an investment by adjusting for the [risk](../r/risk.md) involved. This metric allows organizations to compare different investment opportunities on a level playing field by incorporating the potential financial risks into the evaluation process. The RAROC approach is widely used in financial institutions, particularly banks, as it aids in strategic decision-making, performance evaluation, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

RAROC helps in determining whether a [business](../b/business.md) unit or investment is adding [value](../v/value.md) relative to the amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) required to support the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the investment carries. It combines the concepts of [return](../r/return.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) in a way that offers a comprehensive view of [value](../v/value.md) creation.

## Components of RAROC

RAROC is essentially a ratio that is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{RAROC} = \frac{\text{[Risk-Adjusted Return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md)}}{\text{[Economic Capital](../e/economic_capital.md)}} \]

### Risk-Adjusted Return

The [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) on an investment after adjusting for the risks. It accounts for potential losses due to various [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md) like [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), and [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md). The adjustment involves estimating the potential future losses and subtracting them from the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md).

\[ \text{[Risk-Adjusted Return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md)} = \text{[Expected Return](../e/expected_return.md)} - \text{Expected Loss} \]

### Expected Return

This is the anticipated [return](../r/return.md) on an investment based on historical data, economic forecasts, or other [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md). It includes [income](../i/income.md) earned from dividends, [interest](../i/interest.md), and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains.

### Expected Loss

Expected loss is the potential amount that could be lost due to adverse events such as defaults, [market](../m/market.md) downturns, or failures in processes and systems. It is often calculated using statistical models that take historical loss data and other relevant factors into account.

### Economic Capital

[Economic capital](../e/economic_capital.md) is the amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) a [firm](../f/firm.md) needs to set aside to cover potential losses arising from the risks it is exposed to. It is calculated based on [Value](../v/value.md)-at-[Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR) or other [risk](../r/risk.md) measurement methodologies. [Economic capital](../e/economic_capital.md) is considered a more accurate measure than regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) as it reflects the unique [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of the institution.

\[ \text{[Economic Capital](../e/economic_capital.md)} = f(\text{VaR}, \text{[Stress Testing](../s/stress_testing.md)}, \text{Scenarios}) \]

## Importance and Applications

### Performance Measurement

RAROC allows financial institutions to measure the performance of different [business](../b/business.md) units or portfolios. By standardizing returns in relation to the associated [risk](../r/risk.md), it helps in identifying which units are adding the most [value](../v/value.md) and are worth additional investment.

### Capital Allocation

RAROC aids in the optimal allocation of [capital](../c/capital.md) among various [business](../b/business.md) units and investment opportunities. By focusing on [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns, institutions can ensure that [capital](../c/capital.md) is deployed in areas that [offer](../o/offer.md) the best [risk](../r/risk.md)-reward ratio.

### Risk Management

RAROC integrates [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) into the core financial decision-making process. It ensures that the risks are adequately considered and managed, enabling the institution to maintain financial stability and compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Pricing and Product Development

Financial institutions can use RAROC to price products appropriately by ensuring that the prices reflect the associated risks. This ensures that products and services offered to clients are neither underpriced nor overpriced, leading to sustainable profitability.

## Methodology

The calculation of RAROC involves several steps:
1. **Identification of Risks**: Determine the various [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md) associated with the investment or [business](../b/business.md) unit.
2. **Quantification of Risks**: Use statistical models and historical data to quantify the potential impact of identified risks.
3. **Calculation of Expected Losses**: Estimate the losses that could potentially arise from the identified risks.
4. **Determination of [Economic Capital](../e/economic_capital.md)**: Calculate the amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) required to absorb the potential losses.
5. **Computation of [Risk-Adjusted Return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md)**: Subtract the expected losses from the expected returns.
6. **Calculation of RAROC**: Divide the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) by the [economic capital](../e/economic_capital.md).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Comprehensive Measure**: RAROC provides a comprehensive measure of performance by considering both returns and risks.
- **Better Decision Making**: Helps in making informed decisions regarding [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and product pricing.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Aids in meeting regulatory requirements by ensuring that risks are adequately accounted for.
- **Enhanced [Risk](../r/risk.md) Awareness**: Encourages a culture of [risk](../r/risk.md) awareness within the organization.

### Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: The calculation of RAROC involves complex statistical models and methodologies, which require specialized knowledge.
- **Data Intensive**: Requires extensive data on [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md), historical losses, and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).
- **[Model Risk](../m/model_risk.md)**: The accuracy of RAROC depends on the validity of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) models and assumptions used in its calculation.

## Practical Example

Consider a [bank](../b/bank.md) evaluating two different [loan](../l/loan.md) portfolios. Portfolio A has an [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of $10 million and an expected loss of $2 million, while Portfolio B has an [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of $15 million and an expected loss of $6 million. The [economic capital](../e/economic_capital.md) required for Portfolio A is $5 million, and for Portfolio B, it is $10 million.

For Portfolio A:
\[ \text{[Risk-Adjusted Return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md)} = \$10 \text{ million} - \$2 \text{ million} = \$8 \text{ million} \]
\[ \text{RAROC} = \frac{\$8 \text{ million}}{\$5 \text{ million}} = 1.6 \]

For Portfolio B:
\[ \text{[Risk-Adjusted Return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md)} = \$15 \text{ million} - \$6 \text{ million} = \$9 \text{ million} \]
\[ \text{RAROC} = \frac{\$9 \text{ million}}{\$10 \text{ million}} = 0.9 \]

Based on the RAROC values, Portfolio A is more attractive despite having a lower [expected return](../e/expected_return.md), as it generates higher returns relative to the amount of [economic capital](../e/economic_capital.md) required to cover its risks.

## Conclusion

[Risk-Adjusted Return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) on [Capital](../c/capital.md) (RAROC) is a vital financial metric that provides insights into the profitability and [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure of investments and [business](../b/business.md) units. By incorporating [risk](../r/risk.md) into the [return](../r/return.md) calculation, RAROC enables financial institutions to make better-informed decisions regarding [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md), performance measurement, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Despite its complexity and reliance on [robust](../r/robust.md) data and models, RAROC remains an indispensable tool for achieving sustainable profitability and financial stability.
