# Relative Momentum Strategies

Relative [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) Strategies involve ranking assets based on their past returns and allocating [capital](../c/capital.md) to the top-performing assets over a specific period. Unlike absolute [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies that look at the performance of each [asset](../a/asset.md) alone, relative [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies compare different assets against one another to determine the allocation.

### Conceptual Framework

#### Momentum Effect

The concept of [momentum](../m/momentum.md) is grounded in the observation that past winners tend to continue performing well in the future, while past losers tend to [underperform](../u/underperform.md). This contradicts the [Efficient Market Hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md) (EMH), which posits that all available information is already reflected in [asset](../a/asset.md) prices. [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) effects have been documented in various markets, including equities, commodities, and [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md).

#### Relative vs. Absolute Momentum

- **Absolute [Momentum](../m/momentum.md)**: Focuses on the performance of individual securities relative to their own historical performance.
- **Relative [Momentum](../m/momentum.md)**: Involves ranking and selecting securities based on their performance relative to each other over a specified time frame.

### Mechanics of Relative Momentum Strategies

#### Data Collection

Data is the lifeblood of [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies. The primary inputs include:

1. **Price Data**: Historical price data for the assets in question.
2. **[Volume](../v/volume.md) Data**: Sometimes used to gauge the strength of the price movements.

Data can be obtained from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sources, including financial databases like [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), [Reuters](../r/reuters.md), and more specialized financial data providers such as:

- [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/)
- [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
- [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/)
- [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)

#### Ranking Mechanism

Once the data is collected, assets are ranked based on their [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) over a specific look-back period, which can [range](../r/range.md) from a few days to several months. Commonly used time frames include:

- **1-Month**
- **3-Months**
- **6-Months**
- **12-Months**

The ranking can be based on raw returns or [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

#### Portfolio Construction

After ranking, the top-performing assets are selected for inclusion in the portfolio. Various methods can be applied in this step:

1. **Equal Weighting**: Allocating an equal amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) to each selected [asset](../a/asset.md).
2. **[Risk Parity](../r/risk_parity.md)**: Allocating [capital](../c/capital.md) based on the [risk](../r/risk.md) of each [asset](../a/asset.md), aiming to balance the overall portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md).
3. **Proportional Allocation**: Allocating [capital](../c/capital.md) in proportion to the rank or past performance of each [asset](../a/asset.md).

#### Rebalancing

Portfolios need periodic [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) to maintain the desired allocation and adapt to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions. [Rebalancing frequency](../r/rebalancing_frequency.md) can vary:

1. **Monthly**
2. **Quarterly**
3. **Annually**

[Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) too frequently can lead to higher [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), while [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) too infrequently can result in missed opportunities.

### Quantitative Models

Relative [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies can be implemented using various [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md), including:

#### Time-Series Momentum

This involves looking at the historical performance of assets over a fixed time period and using this to predict future returns. For example:

\[ \text{[Momentum](../m/momentum.md)}_{\text{[asset](../a/asset.md)}} = \text{Price}_{\text{today}} - \text{Price}_{\text{N months ago}} \]

#### Cross-Sectional Momentum

This involves ranking [multiple](../m/multiple.md) securities at a single point in time based on their [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) and selecting the top performers. For example:

\[ \text{Rank}_{\text{[asset](../a/asset.md)}} = \text{Percentile Rank of Returns}_{\text{last 6 months}} \]

#### Combinations

Some strategies use a combination of time-series and cross-sectional [momentum](../m/momentum.md) to enhance signal quality.

### Backtesting and Simulation

Before deploying a relative [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategy in live trading, it is crucial to perform [robust](../r/robust.md) [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and [simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md). This involves:

1. **Historical Performance Analysis**: Testing the strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance.
2. **[Out-of-Sample Testing](../o/out-of-sample_testing.md)**: Using unseen data to test the strategy's robustness.
3. **[Simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md)**: Running the strategy in a simulated environment to assess its performance under various [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) platforms include:

- [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/)
- [Trading Blox](https://tradingblox.com/)
- [MetaTrader](https://www.metatrader4.com/)
- [NinjaTrader](https://ninjatrader.com/)

### Risk Management

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial for the success of relative [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies. Key techniques include:

#### Position Sizing

Determining the optimal amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) to allocate to each position based on [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

#### Stop Losses

Setting predefined levels at which to exit a losing position to minimize losses.

#### Diversification

Allocating [capital](../c/capital.md) across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) assets to spread [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Transaction Costs

[Transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) can significantly impact the performance of relative [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies. These include:

1. **Brokerage Fees**: Costs associated with executing trades.
2. **[Slippage](../s/slippage.md)**: The difference between the expected price of a [trade](../t/trade.md) and the actual executed price.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Impact**: The effect of large trades on the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price.

### Performance Metrics

Key [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) to evaluate the effectiveness of a relative [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategy include:

1. **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**: Measures the [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) on investment over time.
2. **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**: A [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted measure of [return](../r/return.md).
3. **Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md)**: The largest peak-to-[trough](../t/trough.md) decline in the portfolio [value](../v/value.md).
4. **Win Rate**: The proportion of trades that are profitable.

### Applications

Relative [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies can be applied in various markets, including:

#### Equities

Involves ranking and selecting [stocks](../s/stock.md) based on their past performance.

#### ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)

Using ETFs allows for diversified exposure to different sectors or [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

#### Forex

Ranking [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs based on their past performance.

#### Commodities

Selecting top-performing commodities for investment.
