# Round Trip

A round trip is a completed trade that includes both the opening and closing transactions. It can refer to a single buy and sell or a short sale and buy to cover.

## Why it matters
- Used to measure trading activity and turnover.
- Often used in fee calculations or regulatory reporting.
- Helps evaluate the full cost of a trade including commissions and slippage.

## Example
A trader buys 100 shares and later sells 100 shares. This is one round trip.

## Practical notes
Some brokers or regulators define day trading activity based on the number of round trips within a period.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Round Trip and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Round Trip as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Round Trip, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Round Trip. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Round Trip alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
