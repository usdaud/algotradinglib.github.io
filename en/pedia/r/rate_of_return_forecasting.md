1. **[Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (RoR):**
   [Rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) represents the [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss of an investment over a specified period, expressed as a percentage of the investment's initial cost. It is a fundamental measure used to evaluate the performance of an [asset](../a/asset.md) or portfolio. The formula for calculating the [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) is:
   
   \[
   \text{[Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (RoR)} = \frac{\text{(Ending [Value](../v/value.md) - Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)) + Dividends}}{\text{Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)}} \times 100
   \]
