# Robo Advisor

A Robo Advisor, also known as a Robo-Adviser or Robo-Advisor, is an automated platform that provides [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) services with minimal human intervention. These digital platforms utilize algorithms and advanced software to manage a client’s portfolio based on their financial goals, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md). The primary advantage of robo advisors is they [offer](../o/offer.md) accessible, low-cost, and efficient [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) services. 

## How Robo Advisors Work

Robo advisors use complex algorithms and modern portfolio theory (MPT) to create and optimize portfolios. Here are the key features of how Robo Advisors work:

1. **Client Onboarding**: New clients begin by answering a series of questions about their financial situation and goals. Questions may cover aspects such as age, [income](../i/income.md), investment timeline, and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).
2. **Algorithm-Based Recommendations**: Based on the information collected, the robo advisor uses algorithms to generate an ideal portfolio tailored to the client's preferences and needs.
3. **Portfolio Allocation**: The algorithm allocates the client's funds into different types of assets such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, ETFs ([Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Traded Funds), and other securities.
4. **Automatic [Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md)**: Robo advisors periodically review and rebalance the portfolio to maintain the desired [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md). This ensures that the portfolio remains aligned with the client’s [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and investment objectives.
5. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Some advanced robo advisors provide tax-loss harvesting to [offset](../o/offset.md) gains and reduce [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). This process involves selling securities at a loss to counterbalance [capital](../c/capital.md) gains.
6. **Reporting and Analytics**: Clients have access to dashboards and reports that display their [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md) and other relevant financial stats.

## Benefits of Using Robo Advisors

### Cost Savings

Traditional financial advisors typically charge management fees ranging from 1% to 2% of assets under management (AUM). In contrast, robo advisors [offer](../o/offer.md) their services at a fraction of the cost, often charging between 0.25% to 0.75% of AUM. This significant cost reduction makes professional financial advice accessible to a broader audience.

### Accessibility

Robo advisors eliminate [barriers to entry](../b/barriers_to_entry.md) that exist in the traditional financial advisory model. Their services are available online and through mobile applications, which means prospective clients can get started with minimal effort and without the need for in-person consultations.

### Efficiency

The highly automated nature of robo advisors allows for quick and seamless interactions. Tasks that traditionally took days or weeks, such as [portfolio rebalancing](../p/portfolio_rebalancing.md) and investment recommendations, can be performed almost instantaneously.

### Improved Financial Management

By utilizing sophisticated algorithms, robo advisors [offer](../o/offer.md) optimized [portfolio management](../p/par.md) that minimizes [risk](../r/risk.md) and maximizes returns. They underpin their strategies with MPT, which emphasizes [diversification](../d/diversification.md) to achieve the best possible [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

## Limitations of Robo Advisors

### Lack of Human Touch

Despite their efficiencies, robo advisors lack the emotional intelligence and nuanced understanding that human advisors bring. They may not be able to address highly personalized or complex financial scenarios, such as [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md), retirement strategies, or tax issues that require a human touch.

### Algorithm Dependency

Robo advisors heavily depend on algorithms. If algorithms are improperly designed or [fail](../f/fail.md) to account for all external factors, the [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) may [fail](../f/fail.md) to perform optimally. [Market anomalies](../m/market_anomalies.md) and [black swan events](../b/black_swan_events.md) may not be adequately managed by pre-programmed algorithms.

### Limited Services

Robo advisors generally specialize in [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) and automated [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md). They may not [offer](../o/offer.md) comprehensive financial services, such as [debt](../d/debt.md) management, long-term [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md), or detailed retirement plans, which human advisors provide.
