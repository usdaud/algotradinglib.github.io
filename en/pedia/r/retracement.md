# Retracement

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, "retracement" refers to the temporary reverse movement in the price of a [security](../s/security.md) or financial [market](../m/market.md). This can be observed in both [bull](../b/bull.md) and [bear market](../b/bear_market.md) conditions, where the price temporarily moves against the prevailing [trend](../t/trend.md) line before continuing in its original direction. Understanding and identifying retracements can be crucial for traders, as it allows them to make more informed decisions regarding entries and exits.

## Types of Retracement

### Fibonacci Retracement

One of the most well-known tools for identifying retracements is the [Fibonacci Retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md). Based on the Fibonacci sequence, these levels are plotted to anticipate the potential degree of a retracement. Common [Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels include 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%, with 50% being the most significant for identifying a strong [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

### Retracement vs. Reversal

It's crucial to differentiate between a retracement and a [reversal](../r/reversal.md). A retracement is a short-term [pullback](../p/pullback.md) in the price, while a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) encompasses a long-term change in the direction of the [market](../m/market.md). Utilizing [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) helps traders distinguish between the two and make better investment decisions.

## Key Indicators for Retracement

### Moving Averages

Moving averages can act as dynamic [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels. Traders often use simple moving averages (SMA) or exponential moving averages (EMA) in combination with Fibonacci retracements. When the price intersects with one of these levels, it may indicate a possible retracement.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI is another powerful tool. When the RSI enters [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) territory, retracement levels might provide more reliable signals. RSI values above 70 generally indicate [overbought](../o/overbought.md) conditions, while those below 30 signal [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

### Volume

[Volume](../v/volume.md) metrics can also provide insights into the strength of a retracement. If the price moves against the prevailing [trend](../t/trend.md) on low [volume](../v/volume.md), it may signal a temporary retracement rather than a [reversal](../r/reversal.md). Conversely, high [volume](../v/volume.md) in the same movement might indicate a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

## Practical Applications

### Entry and Exit Points

Recognizing retracement levels allows traders to find better entry or exit points. For instance, if a stock retraces to a Fibonacci level and shows signs of resuming its original [trend](../t/trend.md), it might be a good entry point.

### Stop-Loss Orders

Placing [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) at retracement levels can also minimize [risk](../r/risk.md). If the price moves beyond these levels, it may indicate a stronger opposing [trend](../t/trend.md), triggering the stop-loss.

### Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), retracement levels can form part of automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Algorithms can be programmed to recognize retracement levels and execute trades accordingly to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on these temporary price adjustments.

## How to Draw Retracement Levels

1. **Identify the [Trend](../t/trend.md):** Determine the previous [trend](../t/trend.md), either bullish or bearish.
2. **Select High and Low Points:** Choose the significant high and low points from which you want to draw the retracement.
3. **Use a Charting Tool:** Utilize charting tools provided by platforms such as MetaTrader, [TradingView](../t/tradingview.md), or any other trading software to automatically draw retracement levels.

## Conclusion

Understanding retracement is invaluable for traders from novice to expert levels. By incorporating various [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) and tools, one can better navigate the complex world of trading and make more informed decisions. Whether you're involved in manual trading or developing [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) bots, recognizing retracement patterns can significantly boost your trading success.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Retracement and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Retracement as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.
