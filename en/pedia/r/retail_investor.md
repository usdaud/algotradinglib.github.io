# Retail Investor

A retail [investor](../i/investor.md), often referred to as an individual or small [investor](../i/investor.md), is a non-professional [market](../m/market.md) participant who buys and sells securities through traditional or online brokerage firms. Unlike institutional investors, such as pension funds or mutual funds, retail investors typically transact in much smaller quantities and manage their own portfolios, aiming to achieve personal financial goals like retirement savings, college funds, or [wealth](../w/wealth.md) building.

## Characteristics of Retail Investors

Retail investors exhibit a [range](../r/range.md) of characteristics that distinguish them from institutional investors:

1. **Small [Capital](../c/capital.md) Base**: Retail investors generally have smaller amounts of [capital](../c/capital.md) to invest compared to institutional investors.
2. **Individual Financial Goals**: Investments are often aligned with personal objectives, such as saving for retirement, education expenses, or major purchases.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Access**: Retail investors access [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) through brokerage accounts, including online platforms that [offer](../o/offer.md) varying degrees of service, from [discount](../d/discount.md) brokers to full-service brokers.
4. **Investment Strategies**: Typically utilize simpler investment strategies, often focusing on buy-and-[hold](../h/hold.md) techniques, [index](../i/index_instrument.md) funds, or mutual funds.
5. **Information Sources**: Rely on publicly available information, financial news, investment literature, and retail brokerage resources for making investment decisions.
