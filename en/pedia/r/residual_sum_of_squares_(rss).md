# Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)

Residual [Sum of Squares](../s/sum_of_squares.md) (RSS) is a statistical technique used in [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) to quantify the discrepancy between the observed data and the values predicted by a regression model. It is the sum of the squares of the residuals, which are the differences between the observed values and the estimated values of the dependent variable. In essence, RSS measures the level of error in a model, thus serving as a significant [indicator](../i/indicator.md) in model evaluation and selection.

## Definition and Mathematical Representation

RSS can be mathematically defined as follows:

\[ \text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]

Where:
- \( y_i \) represents the observed [value](../v/value.md).
- \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted [value](../v/value.md) from the model.
- \( n \) denotes the number of observations.

RSS is calculated by squaring each individual difference (also known as the residual), and then summing all these squared differences. By squaring the residuals, RSS ensures that positive and negative deviations do not cancel out each other, and it also places a higher weight on larger errors.

## Importance in Regression Analysis

RSS is a crucial metric in [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) for various reasons:

1. **Model Fit Assessment**: A lower RSS indicates a better-fitting model as it suggests that the predicted values are closer to the actual observed values.
2. **Model Comparison**: When comparing different models, the one with the lowest RSS is typically preferred because it has the least deviation from the actual data.
3. **Parameter Estimation**: Minimizing RSS is a common method for parameter estimation in regression models, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.
   
## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

In the context of OLS regression, the objective is to find the regression coefficients (\( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \)) that minimize the RSS:

\[ \text{RSS}(\[beta](../b/beta.md)) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - x_i'\[beta](../b/beta.md))^2 \]

Where:
- \( x_i \) are the independent variables.
- \( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \) are the coefficients to be estimated.
- \( x_i'\[beta](../b/beta.md) \) is the predicted [value](../v/value.md) from the model using the \( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \) coefficients.

By minimizing RSS, the OLS method seeks to find the best possible linear fit for the given data.

## Significance in Model Selection Criteria

Several model selection criteria use RSS as an integral component. Two widely recognized criteria are:

- **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**:
  \[ \text{AIC} = n \ln\left(\frac{\text{RSS}}{n}\right) + 2k \]
  Where \( k \) is the number of parameters in the model.
  
- **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**:
  \[ \text{BIC} = n \ln\left(\frac{\text{RSS}}{n}\right) + k \ln(n) \]

Both AIC and BIC introduce a penalty term for the number of parameters, discouraging [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md).

## RSS in Nonlinear Models

While RSS is predominantly used in [linear models](../l/linear_models_in_trading.md), it can also be applied to nonlinear models. In such cases, the nonlinear function replaces the linear prediction:

\[ \text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - f(x_i; \[theta](../t/theta.md)))^2 \]

Where \( f(x_i; \[theta](../t/theta.md)) \) is the nonlinear function parameterized by \( \[theta](../t/theta.md) \).

## RSS in Machine Learning and Algorithmic Trading

### Machine Learning

In [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), especially for regression tasks, RSS is employed as a loss function. Various algorithms, such as [Linear Regression](../l/linear_regression.md), use minimization of RSS to train the model. However, more complex models, like [Neural Networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) and Gradient Boosting Machines, might use variants or modifications of RSS in their loss functions.

### Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), regression models are frequently used to predict prices and returns of financial instruments. Minimizing RSS helps in building precise prediction models, which are crucial for developing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and algorithms.

## Example Calculation

To illustrate the calculation of RSS, consider a simple dataset:

| Actual [Value](../v/value.md) (y) | Predicted [Value](../v/value.md) (\(\hat{y}\)) | Residual (\(y - \hat{y}\)) | Squared Residual ((\(y - \hat{y}\))^2) |
|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 10               | 12                            | -2                         | 4                                   |
| 15               | 15                            | 0                          | 0                                   |
| 25               | 20                            | 5                          | 25                                  |
| 30               | 29                            | 1                          | 1                                   |
| 50               | 45                            | 5                          | 25                                  |

Sum of Squared Residuals (RSS) = 4 + 0 + 25 + 1 + 25 = 55

In this example, RSS equals 55, indicating the total squared error between the actual and predicted values.

## Implications of RSS

1. **Model Accuracy**: Lower RSS implies a more accurate model.
2. **Model Complexity**: While adding more parameters can reduce RSS, it may lead to [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md). Hence, selecting an appropriate model considering both RSS and complexity is essential.
3. **[Performance Metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md)**: RSS alone does not provide the full picture. Metrics like [R-squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md), Adjusted [R-squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md), AIC, and BIC [complement](../c/complement.md) RSS in model evaluation.
