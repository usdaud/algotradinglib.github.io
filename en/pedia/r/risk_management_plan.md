# Risk Management Plan

A risk management plan is a written framework that defines how a trader or firm manages risk. It covers position sizing, limits, stop rules, and responses to drawdowns.

## Key components
- Maximum loss per trade and per day.
- Position sizing rules and leverage caps.
- Stop loss and exit criteria.
- Scenario analysis and stress testing.
- Review and escalation procedures.

## Example
A plan states that no single trade may risk more than 0.5 percent of account equity and that trading stops after a 2 percent daily loss.

## Practical notes
A plan should be updated when strategies or market conditions change. Consistent enforcement is more important than complexity.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Risk Management Plan and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Risk Management Plan as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Risk Management Plan, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Risk Management Plan. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Risk Management Plan alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
