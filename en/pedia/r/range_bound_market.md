# Range Bound Market

A range bound market is a market state where price oscillates between defined support and resistance levels without establishing a strong trend. It is also called a sideways or consolidating market.

## Characteristics
- Repeated swings between a top and bottom range.
- Lower directional momentum and more mean reversion.
- Breakouts often fail unless volume expands.

## Example
A stock trades between 95 and 102 for several weeks. Traders buy near 95 and sell near 102 until a breakout occurs.

## Trading approach
Range traders use support and resistance, oscillators, and tight risk limits. Trend strategies often struggle in this regime.

## Risks
Ranges eventually break. Traders must be ready to exit if price moves beyond the boundaries with strength.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Range Bound Market and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Range Bound Market as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Range Bound Market, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Range Bound Market. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Range Bound Market alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
