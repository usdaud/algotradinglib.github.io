# Risk Limit

A risk limit is a predefined constraint that restricts exposure or losses. It can apply to a trade, a strategy, or an entire portfolio.

## Types
- Position size limits.
- Daily loss limits.
- Maximum leverage or exposure limits.
- Concentration limits by asset or sector.

## Example
A desk sets a daily loss limit of 2 percent of capital. If losses reach that level, trading is halted for the day.

## Practical notes
Risk limits are only effective if enforced. Automated controls and real time monitoring improve compliance.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Risk Limit and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Risk Limit as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Risk Limit, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Risk Limit. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Risk Limit alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
