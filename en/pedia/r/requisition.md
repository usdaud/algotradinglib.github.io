# Requisition in Financial and Trading Contexts

Requisition in financial and trading contexts refers to a formal request or [demand](../d/demand.md) for something, typically an [order](../o/order.md) or purchase. The term is broadly used across different sectors within [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, and it can encompass [multiple](../m/multiple.md) processes depending on the specific context. Here, requisition can involve stock orders, [procurement](../p/procurement.md) of financial instruments, or even internal requests within financial institutions. Understanding its multidimensional applications helps in navigating the complexities of financial operations.

## Stock Requisition

In the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), requisition refers to the formal process by which traders, investors, or institutional clients place requests for purchasing or selling [stocks](../s/stock.md). This involves several steps, from the initiation of the [order](../o/order.md) to its [execution](../e/execution.md).

1. **[Order](../o/order.md) Placement**: The requisition process starts with the [trader](../t/trader.md) or [investor](../i/investor.md) placing an [order](../o/order.md) with their [broker](../b/broker.md). This can be done through online trading platforms, directly through phone orders, or via instructions given in [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

2. **[Order](../o/order.md) Processing**: Once the [order](../o/order.md) is received, it is processed by the [broker](../b/broker.md) who then forwards it to the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for [execution](../e/execution.md). This stage may involve various checks and validations to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

3. **[Execution](../e/execution.md) and Confirmation**: The [order](../o/order.md) is executed on the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), and the confirmation is sent back to the [broker](../b/broker.md) and subsequently to the [trader](../t/trader.md) or [investor](../i/investor.md). This concludes the requisition cycle.

## Requisition in Procurement

In financial institutions, requisition is often used in the context of [procurement](../p/procurement.md) of goods and services. Large financial institutions frequently require specialized services, technology solutions, or physical commodities, and requisition forms part of the [procurement](../p/procurement.md) cycle.

1. **Need Identification**: The process begins with identifying the need for a particular good or service. This is often formalized through an internal requisition which specifies the requirements and justifies the need.

2. **Approval Process**: The requisition is then forwarded for approval to relevant authorities within the organization. This step involves [budget](../b/budget.md) checks, compliance verification, and approval from [upper management](../u/upper_management.md).

3. **Supplier Engagement**: Upon approval, the [procurement](../p/procurement.md) team engages with suppliers through Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for [Quotation](../q/quotation.md) (RFQ) processes. Vendors provide their bids, and the best fit is selected after evaluations.

4. **[Order](../o/order.md) Placement and Delivery**: The formal purchase [order](../o/order.md) is issued to the chosen supplier, and upon acceptance, the delivery process is initiated. Often, financial institutions employ technology platforms to streamline these stages.

## Financial Instruments Requisition

Requisition in the context of financial instruments refers to the formal request to acquire or dispose of various financial products, including bonds, [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), mutual funds, etc.

1. **Instrument Selection**: Investors or portfolio managers determine the need to add or remove a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) based on their [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) or changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

2. **Research and Analysis**: This stage involves detailed research and analysis of the selected instruments considering factors like [risk](../r/risk.md), [return](../r/return.md), [market](../m/market.md) trends, and regulatory impacts.

3. **Formal Request Submission**: A formal requisition is then submitted through designated channels in the financial institution. This may involve filling out detailed forms and providing necessary documentation.

4. **[Execution](../e/execution.md) and Portfolio Adjustment**: Upon approval, the [order](../o/order.md) is executed either through direct [market](../m/market.md) interactions or via internal trading desks. Post-[execution](../e/execution.md), necessary adjustments are made in the portfolios.

## Internal Requisition Processes

In financial organizations, internal requisition processes are crucial for departments to function efficiently. These requisitions can [range](../r/range.md) from operational needs to strategic initiatives.

1. **Operational Requisitions**: Everyday operational requisitions include requests for office supplies, IT equipment, maintenance services, etc. These are typically managed through an internal requisition system or enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools.

2. **Strategic Requisitions**: For projects that require substantial resources or new capabilities, strategic requisitions are raised. Examples include introducing new trading platforms, expanding research departments, or undertaking new [financial modeling](../f/financial_modeling.md) initiatives.

3. **Approval Workflow**: Both operational and strategic requisitions follow an approval workflow involving [multiple](../m/multiple.md) levels of authorizations. This ensures proper resource allocation and adherence to [budget](../b/budget.md) constraints.

4. **Implementation**: Once approved, the requisition is processed, and the required resources are allocated to the requesting department. Periodic reviews are conducted to assess the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and outcomes of these requisitioned resources.

## Technology and Requisition Processes

With advancements in FinTech, the requisition processes in financial and trading contexts have become more streamlined and efficient. Technologies play a significant role in enhancing the speed, accuracy, and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) of requisitions.

1. **[Automated Trading Systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md)**: In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), requisition processes are automated through pre-defined algorithms that execute buy/sell orders based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This reduces the manual intervention and speeds up [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md).

2. **[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) for Requisition Tracking**: [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology offers an immutable ledger for tracking requisition processes, especially in [procurement](../p/procurement.md). It ensures [transparency](../t/transparency.md), reduces [fraud](../f/fraud.md), and enhances [trust](../t/trust.md) among stakeholders.

3. **ERP and CRM Systems**: Modern ERP and CRM systems integrate requisition workflows, enabling seamless operation across financial institutions. These systems support everything from initial requisition generation to final [execution](../e/execution.md) and reporting.

4. **AI and [Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md)**: AI and [Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) technologies aid in predictive analysis, helping financial organizations make informed requisition decisions. AI models can forecast the [demand](../d/demand.md) for particular instruments, optimize [procurement](../p/procurement.md) processes, and predict [market](../m/market.md) movements.

## Conclusion

Requisition in financial and trading contexts is a multifaceted process encompassing various activities from stock orders to internal departmental needs. The common thread across all types of requisitions is the need for formal requests, approval processes, and [execution](../e/execution.md) mechanisms. In modern [finance](../f/finance.md), the adoption of technology has significantly enhanced the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and effectiveness of requisition processes, allowing organizations to operate seamlessly and maintain competitive advantages.
