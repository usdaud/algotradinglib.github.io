# Rule of Thumb

In [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, a "rule of thumb" refers to a general principle derived from practical experience rather than theory or scientific methodology. These simple, heuristic guidelines aim to streamline decision-making processes, making complex financial landscapes more manageable. While not founded on rigorous empirical evidence, these rules can provide valuable insights and often resonate due to their simplicity and real-world applicability.

## Key Rules of Thumb in Finance and Trading

### 1. The 50/30/20 Budgeting Rule
One of the most popular rules of thumb for [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md) is the 50/30/20 budgeting rule. It suggests dividing your [after-tax income](../a/after-tax_income.md) into three categories:
- **50% for needs**: Essentials such as rent, groceries, transportation, and utilities.
- **30% for wants**: Discretionary spending, including dining out, entertainment, and hobbies.
- **20% for savings and [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md)**: Investments, emergency funds, and paying off debts.

### 2. The 4% Rule for Retirement
The 4% rule is a guideline for retirees on how much they can safely withdraw from their retirement savings each year without running out of [money](../m/money.md). The rule suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement portfolio's [value](../v/value.md) in the first year and then adjusting the amount by the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate in subsequent years. This rule emerged from the "Trinity Study" conducted by three professors from Trinity University.

### 3. The Rule of 72
The [Rule of 72](../r/rule_of_72.md) is a quick, useful formula to estimate the number of years required to double the invested [money](../m/money.md) at a given annual [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md). You simply divide 72 by the expected [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) percentage. For instance, if you expect an 8% [annual return](../a/annual_return.md), dividing 72 by 8 indicates it [will](../w/will.md) take about 9 years to double the investment.

### 4. The PE Ratio Rule
The Price to [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (PE) ratio rule of thumb helps investors evaluate whether a stock is overpriced or underpriced. A lower PE ratio may suggest a stock is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), whereas a higher PE ratio might indicate overvaluation. However, this rule is more effective when comparing companies within the same [industry](../i/industry.md).

### 5. The Two Percent Rule in Trading
In trading, the two percent rule advises not to [risk](../r/risk.md) more than 2% of your trading [capital](../c/capital.md) on a single [trade](../t/trade.md). This [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategy aims to protect traders from significant losses and preserve [capital](../c/capital.md) over the long term.

### 6. The Debt-to-Income Ratio Rule
Lenders often use the [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[income](../i/income.md) ratio to assess a borrower's ability to manage monthly [debt](../d/debt.md) payments. A common rule of thumb is that your [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[income](../i/income.md) ratio should not exceed 36%. This ratio is calculated by dividing your total monthly [debt](../d/debt.md) payments by your gross monthly [income](../i/income.md).

### 7. The 110 Minus Age Rule for Asset Allocation
The 110 minus age rule is a simplified strategy for determining the percentage of your portfolio that should be allocated to [stocks](../s/stock.md). According to this rule, you subtract your age from 110, and the result is the percentage of your portfolio to invest in [stocks](../s/stock.md), with the remainder allocated to bonds. This rule adapts the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) to become more conservative as you age.

### 8. The 1% Rule for Investment Property
In [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment, the 1% rule states that the monthly rent generated by a property should be at least 1% of its purchase price. This rule helps investors quickly screen potential rental properties to assess [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) potential.

### 9. The 20% Equity Rule in Refinancing
When considering refinancing your [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), a common rule of thumb is to ensure you have at least 20% [equity](../e/equity.md) in your [home](../h/home.md). This rule helps avoid the costs and complications associated with private [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI).

### 10. The Coffeehouse Portfolio Rule
The coffeehouse portfolio rule, popularized by Bill Schultheis's book "The Coffeehouse [Investor](../i/investor.md)," suggests a simple, diversified mix of seven [index](../i/index_instrument.md) funds:
- 40% in the total [bond](../b/bond.md) [market index](../m/market_index.md) [fund](../f/fund.md)
- 10% in the S&P 500 [index fund](../i/index_fund.md)
- 10% in large-cap [value](../v/value.md) [index fund](../i/index_fund.md)
- 10% in small-cap [index fund](../i/index_fund.md)
- 10% in small-cap [value](../v/value.md) [index fund](../i/index_fund.md)
- 10% in REIT [index fund](../i/index_fund.md)
- 10% in international stock [index fund](../i/index_fund.md)
  
This rule of thumb illustrates a straightforward approach to achieving [diversification](../d/diversification.md) with relatively low maintenance.

## Advantages of Rules of Thumb
- **Simplicity**: Rules of thumb are easily understood, making them accessible to both novice and experienced investors.
- **Speed**: They provide quick guidelines, reducing the decision-making time.
- **Experience-based**: Derived from practical experience, these rules often prove effective across various scenarios.

## Limitations of Rules of Thumb
- **Lack of Precision**: They are broad guidelines and may not apply perfectly to every situation.
- **Economic [Variability](../v/variability.md)**: [Market](../m/market.md) conditions and personal circumstances can change, rendering some rules less effective.
- **Over-Simplification**: Complex financial situations may require more nuanced approaches than these rules permit.

## Application in Algorithmic Trading and Fintech
### Algorithmic Trading
In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), rules of thumb can serve as foundational principles for developing [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). For instance, the two percent rule can be embedded within [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) algorithms. Similarly, the PE ratio rule can be part of stock selection models:
- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Rules of thumb can be tested using historical data to evaluate their efficacy and refine algorithms accordingly.
- **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md)**: Algorithms can be trained using these [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md) as [baseline](../b/baseline.md) metrics to enhance predictive accuracy and decision-making.

### Fintech
Financial technology (fintech) companies often incorporate rules of thumb into their tools and platforms to assist users in managing their finances:
- **Budgeting Apps**: Leveraging the 50/30/20 rule, apps can automate [budget](../b/budget.md) recommendations.
- **Robo-Advisors**: Utilizing [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) rules, such as the 110 minus age rule, robo-advisors provide tailored investment strategies.

## Conclusion
Rules of thumb in [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading provide valuable, experience-based guidelines that simplify decision-making. While not foolproof, they [offer](../o/offer.md) a practical framework for managing personal finances, evaluating investments, and formulating [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Leveraging these rules in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) and fintech applications further underscores their [utility](../u/utility.md), blending traditional wisdom with modern technology to enhance financial decision-making.
