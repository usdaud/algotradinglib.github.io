# Robust Optimization

[Robust](../r/robust.md) [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) (RO) is a field within [optimization](../o/optimization.md) that deals with decision-making problems under [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). In contrast to classical [optimization](../o/optimization.md), which assumes precise inputs, [robust](../r/robust.md) [optimization](../o/optimization.md) explicitly incorporates uncertain data, seeking solutions that perform well across a [range](../r/range.md) of possible scenarios. This approach is crucial in many real-world applications, including [finance](../f/finance.md), [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management, engineering, and more.

## Key Concepts in Robust Optimization

### Uncertainty Sets

The cornerstone of [robust](../r/robust.md) [optimization](../o/optimization.md) is the concept of [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) sets. These sets describe all possible values that uncertain parameters can take. Common types of [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) sets include:

1. **Box [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md):** Each uncertain parameter varies within an independent interval.
2. **Ellipsoidal [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md):** Parameters vary within an ellipsoid, often used when there's a known [correlation](../c/correlation.md) between uncertainties.
3. **Polyhedral [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md):** Parameters are constrained within a polyhedron, allowing for more complex relationships and dependencies.

### Robust Counterparts

For an [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problem with uncertain parameters, the [robust](../r/robust.md) counterpart is a reformulation that seeks solutions feasible for all possible realizations within the [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) set. The goal is to ensure that the obtained solution remains viable under varying conditions. Techniques used to derive [robust](../r/robust.md) counterparts include:

1. **Primal [Robust](../r/robust.md) Counterparts:** Translating the uncertain problem directly into a [robust](../r/robust.md) form.
2. **Dual [Robust](../r/robust.md) Counterparts:** Using duality theory to obtain a [robust](../r/robust.md) formulation.

### Objectives in Robust Optimization

1. **Minimax Approach:** Minimize the worst-case scenario outcome.
2. **Expected Outcome:** Balance the performance across typical scenarios.
3. **[Trade](../t/trade.md)-off Models:** Find a balance between robustness and optimality, considering [risk](../r/risk.md) preferences.

### Applications of Robust Optimization

#### 1. Finance

[Robust](../r/robust.md) [optimization](../o/optimization.md) is widely used in [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly in [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md), where it helps manage risks associated with uncertain [asset](../a/asset.md) returns. Key applications include:

- **[Portfolio Optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md):** Maximizing the worst-case returns or minimizing the [risk](../r/risk.md) for a given level of returns.
- **[Asset](../a/asset.md) [Liability](../l/liability.md) Management:** Ensuring assets sufficiently cover liabilities under various economic scenarios.

Example: Goldman Sachs [link to recent research or application on the company's official website].

#### 2. Supply Chain Management

In [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management, [robust](../r/robust.md) [optimization](../o/optimization.md) assists in designing systems to withstand [demand](../d/demand.md) [variability](../v/variability.md), [lead time](../l/lead_time.md) uncertainties, and [supply](../s/supply.md) disruptions. Applications include:

- **[Inventory Management](../i/inventory_management.md):** Balancing stock levels to avoid both excess and stockouts under [demand](../d/demand.md) [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).
- **Network Design:** Creating resilient transportation and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) networks.

Example: IBM's approach to [robust](../r/robust.md) [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) solutions [Link to relevant IBM page].

#### 3. Engineering

In engineering, [robust](../r/robust.md) [optimization](../o/optimization.md) is applied to design systems and structures that maintain performance despite changing operating conditions and material properties. Applications include:

- **Structural Design:** Ensuring buildings and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) can [handle](../h/handle.md) various environmental stresses.
- **Control Systems:** Designing [controllers](../c/controller.md) that perform reliably across a [range](../r/range.md) of operating conditions.

### Methodologies in Robust Optimization

Several methodologies have been developed to tackle [robust](../r/robust.md) [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems, including:
