# Risk Adjusted Performance

[Risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted performance is a concept within [finance](../f/finance.md) and investment that attempts to measure the profitability of an investment in relation to the amount of [risk](../r/risk.md) taken to achieve that profitability. This metric is crucial for investors looking to understand whether an investment's returns are commensurate with the risks taken. It helps in making an apples-to-apples comparison of different investments or investment strategies.

#### Importance of Risk-Adjusted Performance

1. **Balanced Decision-Making**: [Risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) allow investors to make balanced decisions by considering both returns and risks.
2. **[Portfolio Optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md)**: These metrics are essential for optimizing a diversified portfolio. They ensure that the [risk](../r/risk.md) level is appropriate given the expected returns.
3. **[Performance Benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md)**: This approach helps in benchmarking the success of different investments under varying [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

#### Key Ratios and Metrics

1. **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**: 
   - **Definition**: The [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) is the most widely used metric, which measures the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) (or [risk premium](../r/risk_premium.md)) per unit of [risk](../r/risk.md) in an investment.
   - **Formula**: [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) = (Rp – Rf) / σp
     - Rp = Expected portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
     - Rf = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
     - σp = [Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
   - **Pros**: Simple, intuitive, widely accepted.
   - **Cons**: Assumes returns are normally distributed, does not account for extreme events.

2. **[Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md)**:
   - **Definition**: The [Treynor ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md) measures returns earned in excess of what could have been earned on an investment with no diversifiable [risk](../r/risk.md) per each unit of [market risk](../m/market_risk.md).
   - **Formula**: [Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md) = (Rp - Rf) / βp
     - Rp = Portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
     - Rf = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
     - βp = [Beta](../b/beta.md) of the portfolio
   - **Pros**: Helpful for assessing portfolios considering [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md).
   - **Cons**: Assumes a well-diversified portfolio, focuses only on [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md).

3. **[Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md)**:
   - **Definition**: Jensen’s [alpha](../a/alpha.md) measures the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) a portfolio generates over its [expected return](../e/expected_return.md), given its [beta](../b/beta.md) and the [market](../m/market.md)’s [excess return](../e/excess_return.md).
   - **Formula**: [Alpha](../a/alpha.md) = Rp – [Rf + βp (Rm – Rf)]
     - Rp = Portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
     - Rf = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
     - βp = [Beta](../b/beta.md) of the portfolio
     - Rm = [Market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md)
   - **Pros**: Good for assessing manager performance.
   - **Cons**: [Alpha](../a/alpha.md) is influenced by time frame of the returns measured.

4. **[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)**:
   - **Definition**: The [Sortino ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) differentiates harmful [volatility](../v/volatility.md) from overall [volatility](../v/volatility.md) by using [downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md) instead of [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md).
   - **Formula**: [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) = (Rp – Rf) / σd
     - Rp = Expected portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
     - Rf = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
     - σd = [Downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md) of the portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
   - **Pros**: Focuses on [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md), aligns with [investor](../i/investor.md) perspective.
   - **Cons**: More complex, less widely used than the [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md).

5. **[M2](../m/m2.md) (Modigliani-Modigliani Measure)**:
   - **Definition**: The [M2](../m/m2.md) measure adjusts a portfolio's [return](../r/return.md) to the same [risk](../r/risk.md) level as the [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md), allowing direct performance comparison.
   - **Formula**: [M2](../m/m2.md) = Rp + (Rm- Rf) * (σp / σm)
     - Rp = Portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
     - Rf = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
     - Rm = [Market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md)
     - σp = [Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
     - σm = [Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md)
   - **Pros**: Provides a clear, normalized performance comparison.
   - **Cons**: Less intuitive, requires more data.

#### Applications in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (or algo-trading) leverages computer algorithms to execute trades based on predefined strategies. Evaluating and optimizing these strategies using [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) is paramount.

1. **Strategy Development**:
   - **Objective**: Utilize [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted metrics to develop [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that maximize returns while managing [risk](../r/risk.md).
   - **Process**: [Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) strategies against historical data, optimizing parameters to improve [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted metrics such as the [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) or [Sortino ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md).
   - **Example**: A mean-reversion strategy might be tweaked to reduce exposure during high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) periods to improve its [Sortino ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md).

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - **Objective**: Continuously monitor the live performance of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) by measuring [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.
   - **Tools**: Real-time analytics platforms that compute [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted metrics as trades are executed.
   - **Example**: A high-frequency trading algorithm might continuously calculate its [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) to adjust its [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) parameters dynamically.

3. **[Portfolio Management](../p/portfolio_management.md)**:
   - **Objective**: Manage an [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) portfolio to balance [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md).
   - **Approach**: Diversify across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) algorithms, each targeting different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes or strategies, and use [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted metrics to reallocate between them.
   - **Example**: A portfolio containing [trend](../t/trend.md)-following and [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategies might be rebalanced if the [Treynor ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md) of the [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategies significantly outperforms that of the [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategies.

### Conclusion

[Risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted performance is a fundamental concept for both individual investors and institutional portfolio managers. By focusing on the [return](../r/return.md) in conjunction with the [risk](../r/risk.md) taken to achieve that [return](../r/return.md), it provides a clearer picture of an investment’s true performance. Metrics like the [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), [Treynor ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md), and Jensen’s [alpha](../a/alpha.md) facilitate more informed decision-making, aiding in strategy development, real-time monitoring, and effective [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) in the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Using these tools judiciously can help investors achieve a balanced, rewarding investment experience.
