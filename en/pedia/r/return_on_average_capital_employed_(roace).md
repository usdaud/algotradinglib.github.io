# Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE)

[Return](../r/return.md) on Average [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md) (ROACE) is a key [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) metric used to assess a company's profitability and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in using its [capital](../c/capital.md). Unlike the more common [Return](../r/return.md) on [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md) (ROCE), which uses the [capital](../c/capital.md) at a single point in time, ROACE provides a more nuanced view by averaging the [capital employed](../c/capital_employed.md) over a period. This averaging process reduces the impact of [seasonality](../s/seasonality.md) and extraordinary financial events, [offering](../o/offering.md) a steadier measure of performance.

## Understanding ROACE

### Definition and Formula
ROACE is defined as the [operating profit](../o/operating_profit.md) generated per unit of the average [capital employed](../c/capital_employed.md) during a specific period. The formula for ROACE is:

\[ \text{ROACE} = \frac{\text{Operating Profit}}{\text{Average [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)}} \times 100 \]

Where:
- **[Operating Profit](../o/operating_profit.md)** is also known as [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Before [Interest](../i/interest.md) and [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) (EBIT).
- **Average [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)** is typically the mean of the opening and closing [capital employed](../c/capital_employed.md) for the period.

### Components of ROACE
1. **[Operating Profit](../o/operating_profit.md) (EBIT)**: This is the [profit](../p/profit.md) from normal [business](../b/business.md) operations, excluding tax and [interest](../i/interest.md) expenses. It indicates the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the core [business activities](../b/business_activities.md).

2. **Average [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)**: This is the amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) ([equity](../e/equity.md) plus [long-term liabilities](../l/long-term_liabilities.md)) used by the company over the period. It’s calculated as:
 \[
 \text{Average [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)} = \frac{\text{Opening [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)} + \text{Closing [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)}}{2}
 \]

## Importance of ROACE

- **Profitability and [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: ROACE helps in evaluating how well a company is converting its investments into profitable returns. A higher ROACE indicates better performance in using [capital](../c/capital.md) effectively.

- **Investment Decisions**: Investors and stakeholders use ROACE to assess the attractiveness of a company as a potential investment. It provides insight into how efficiently a company is managed and its potential for sustainable growth.

- **Benchmarking**: Companies use ROACE to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) against peers or [industry](../i/industry.md) standards. It assists in understanding competitive standing and identifying areas needing improvement.

- **Internal Performance Measurement**: Management uses ROACE to set performance targets and measure the success of strategic initiatives over time.

## Calculation Example

Let's consider a hypothetical example to illustrate the calculation of ROACE:

- **[Operating Profit](../o/operating_profit.md) (EBIT)**: $120 million
- **Opening [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)**: $800 million
- **Closing [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)**: $900 million

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Calculate Average [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)**:
 \[
 \text{Average [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)} = \frac{800\, \text{million} + 900\, \text{million}}{2} = 850\, \text{million}
 \]

2. **Calculate ROACE**:
 \[
 \text{ROACE} = \frac{120\, \text{million}}{850\, \text{million}} \times 100 = 14.12\%
 \]

### Analysis

In this example, a ROACE of 14.12% indicates that the company generates $14.12 as [operating profit](../o/operating_profit.md) for every $100 of [capital employed](../c/capital_employed.md) on average. This reflects relatively efficient [capital](../c/capital.md) utilization.

## Applications of ROACE

### Sector Analysis

Different industries have varying [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements and operational structures, which influence typical ROACE values. For instance:
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md)-Intensive Industries**: Sectors like utilities or [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) may have lower ROACE due to substantial [fixed capital](../f/fixed_capital.md) investments.
- **Service-Based Industries**: Sectors like technology or consulting often exhibit higher ROACE as they require less [fixed capital](../f/fixed_capital.md).

### Trend Analysis

Examining ROACE over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) periods aids in spotting trends — whether a company is improving its [capital](../c/capital.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) or facing declines. It can inform strategies such as:
- **Operational Improvements**: Identifying areas where operational efficiencies can be enhanced.
- **[Capital Allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md)**: Making informed decisions about [capital budgeting](../c/capital_budgeting.md), investments, or divestments.

## Limitations of ROACE

While ROACE is a valuable metric, it has its limitations:

- **Non-Comparable**: Difficult to compare across industries with different [capital](../c/capital.md) structures.
- **Does Not Account for [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Higher operating profits might result from higher [risk](../r/risk.md), which ROACE does not capture.
- **Dependent on Averaging Period**: The choice of period can affect the ROACE [value](../v/value.md). Short-term variations might be smoothened out, missing immediate concerns.
- **Neglects Non-Operating Factors**: Excludes financial and [extraordinary items](../e/extraordinary_item.md) that might affect a company’s comprehensive performance.

## ROACE in Financial Reporting

Organizations may report ROACE in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) or [investor](../i/investor.md) presentations. It is especially prevalent in reports of companies with significant [capital](../c/capital.md) investments, such as:
- **Oil and Gas Companies**: Due to the large scale of [capital employed](../c/capital_employed.md) in exploration and production activities.
- **[Utility](../u/utility.md) Companies**: Given their substantial [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) investments.

For instance, multinational energy companies such as Royal Dutch Shell or ExxonMobil often highlight ROACE in their annual reports to showcase their [capital](../c/capital.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and strategic performance over time.

## Conclusion

ROACE is a crucial financial metric providing insights into a company's effectiveness in utilizing its [capital](../c/capital.md) to generate operating profits. By considering average [capital employed](../c/capital_employed.md), it offers a stable and comprehensive view of a company's [capital](../c/capital.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) over time. Though it has limitations, when used alongside other financial indicators, ROACE is instrumental in strategic decision-making, [investment analysis](../i/investment_analysis.md), and [performance benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md).
