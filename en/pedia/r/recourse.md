# Recourse

Recourse is a term commonly used in [finance](../f/finance.md) and legal contexts to describe the right to [demand](../d/demand.md) compensation or restitution, typically in the form of funds or assets, if one party fails to meet the [obligations](../o/obligation.md) stipulated in a contract. The ability to seek recourse ensures that lenders and investors have some form of protection or remediation in the event of [default](../d/default.md) or other financial discrepancies. This concept is crucial for understanding the dynamics of financial agreements, whether in personal lending, [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), or investment strategies.

## Types of Recourse

There are several types of recourse that can come into play, including:

### Full Recourse

Full recourse allows the [lender](../l/lender.md) to go after the borrower's personal and other assets if the borrower defaults on the [loan](../l/loan.md). This type of recourse provides the [lender](../l/lender.md) with a higher degree of [security](../s/security.md) because they can recover the full amount of the [loan](../l/loan.md) plus any [interest](../i/interest.md) and fees from the borrower.

### Limited Recourse

Limited recourse restricts the [lender](../l/lender.md)'s ability to recover funds to specific assets or [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams specified in the agreement. This type of recourse is often used in [project finance](../p/project_finance.md) and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investments where the [loan](../l/loan.md) is secured by the project or property itself. 

### Non-Recourse

Non-recourse means the [lender](../l/lender.md) can only seize the [collateral](../c/collateral.md) specified in the [loan](../l/loan.md) agreement, such as the property itself, and cannot go after the borrower's other assets. This type is often utilized in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and certain types of securitized loans. 

### Soft and Hard Recourse

Soft recourse involves some degree of flexibility or [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) room in the enforcement of the recourse terms, whereas hard recourse refers to rigid terms that must be strictly adhered to without exceptions.

## The Importance of Recourse in Structured Finance

In [structured finance](../s/structured_finance.md), the concept of recourse plays a significant role in shaping the [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md) of various financial products. For instance, securitized loans often come with non-recourse clauses, which help in offloading [risk](../r/risk.md) from the [lender](../l/lender.md) to the investors. This can make such products more attractive but also riskier, depending on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets' performance.

## Legal Recourse

In the context of legal [finance](../f/finance.md), legal recourse refers to the legal right to enforce the terms of an agreement or to seek compensation for losses. This often involves litigation or [arbitration](../a/arbitration.md) processes and can [range](../r/range.md) from simple contractual agreements to complex financial instruments like [credit default swaps](../c/credit_default_swaps.md).

## Recourse vs Non-Recourse Loans

### Recourse Loans

In a [recourse loan](../r/recourse_loan.md), the borrower is personally liable for the [debt](../d/debt.md). If the borrower defaults, the [lender](../l/lender.md) can pursue legal action to claim other assets the borrower owns, in addition to the [collateral](../c/collateral.md). Recourse loans typically come with lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates because they pose less [risk](../r/risk.md) to the [lender](../l/lender.md). However, they also transfer a higher [risk](../r/risk.md) to the borrower.

**Example of Recourse Loans:**
- Personal loans
- [Business](../b/business.md) loans
- Certain types of mortgages

### Non-Recourse Loans

Non-recourse loans limit the [lender](../l/lender.md)’s ability to recover their funds to the specific [collateral](../c/collateral.md) mentioned in the [loan](../l/loan.md) agreement. If the borrower defaults, the [lender](../l/lender.md) can seize the [collateral](../c/collateral.md) but cannot pursue other assets the borrower might own. These loans usually come with higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates because the [lender](../l/lender.md) bears more [risk](../r/risk.md).

**Example of Non-Recourse Loans:**
- Car loans
- Certain [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) loans
- Specific types of [business](../b/business.md) loans

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algo-trading, involves using algorithms to automate trading decisions and executions. Recourse, as a form of [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), is an essential component in the design and deployment of these algorithms.

### Backtesting

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) involves testing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) using historical data. Recourse mechanisms can be coded into algorithms to simulate actions that would be taken if a [trade](../t/trade.md) fails to meet the desired criteria. This can help in better assessing the [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profile of the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

### Risk Management Algorithms

Recourse [options](../o/options.md) can be embedded in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) algorithms to automatically take corrective actions when certain thresholds are breached. For instance, if a stock's price falls below a specified limit, the algorithm might [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) the position to minimize losses.

## Impact on Financial Technology (FinTech)

In the ever-evolving world of Financial Technology (FinTech), recourse mechanisms are becoming increasingly sophisticated. They’re not just limited to traditional financial instruments but also extend to more contemporary platforms like [peer-to-peer lending](../p/peer-to-peer_lending.md), robo-advisors, and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)-based [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md).

### Peer-to-Peer Lending

In [peer-to-peer lending](../p/peer-to-peer_lending.md) platforms, recourse terms are often clearly specified to protect both lenders and borrowers. This ensures [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and helps mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).

**Example of P2P Lending Platforms:** 
- [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com)
- [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com)

### Robo-Advisors

Robo-advisors use algorithms to manage investment portfolios. Recourse [options](../o/options.md) can be programmed to automatically rebalance the portfolio if certain [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) are not met.

### Smart Contracts

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)-based [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) can integrate recourse terms to automatically enact penalties or corrective measures if one party fails to meet their [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This automation reduces the need for intermediaries and increases the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of financial transactions.

**Example of [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) Platforms [Offering](../o/offering.md) [Smart Contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md):** 
- [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org)
- [Chainlink](https://chain.link)

## Regulatory Considerations

Recourse terms are also subject to regulatory oversight. Different jurisdictions have various rules and guidelines about how recourse can be exercised, especially concerning consumer protection and fair lending practices.

### Regulatory Bodies

Some of the key regulatory bodies that oversee recourse practices include:
- Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC): Oversees securities markets in the USA.
- Financial Conduct Authority (FCA): Regulates financial firms in the UK.
- European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA): Manages securities markets regulation within the EU.

### Compliance

Financial institutions must comply with these regulations to avoid legal repercussions and maintain their licenses. Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties, including fines and the revocation of operating licenses.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Recourse in Mortgage Banking

During the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), the recourse terms in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans were critically examined. Many non-recourse loans went into [default](../d/default.md), leading to significant losses for lenders since they couldn't pursue borrowers' other assets. This event highlighted the risks involved in non-recourse lending and led to more stringent regulatory measures.

### Case Study 2: Recourse in Corporate Finance

In [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), recourse terms in loans and bonds can significantly impact a company's [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies. For example, General Electric (GE) has various recourse and non-recourse [financing](../f/financing.md) [options](../o/options.md) to manage its [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) efficiently.

### Case Study 3: Peer-to-Peer Lending

A [peer-to-peer lending](../p/peer-to-peer_lending.md) platform like Lending Club offers both recourse and non-recourse loans. The availability of recourse loans often attracts more conservative investors willing to [trade](../t/trade.md) off some [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) returns for added [security](../s/security.md).
