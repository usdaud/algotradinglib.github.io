# Revolving Loan Facility

A revolving [loan](../l/loan.md) [facility](../f/facility.md) is a type of [credit](../c/credit.md) issued by a financial institution that provides the borrower with the flexibility to draw down, repay, and redrawn loans advanced to it. It is similar to a [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) in terms of usage: the borrower can access funds up to a certain [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md), repay these funds, and borrow again as needed. Revolving [loan](../l/loan.md) facilities are frequently used by companies to manage their working [capital](../c/capital.md) needs because they [offer](../o/offer.md) a readily available source of funds on an ongoing [basis](../b/basis.md).

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## Key Features of Revolving Loan Facility

- **[Credit Limit](../c/credit_limit.md)**: This is the maximum amount of [money](../m/money.md) that the borrower can access at any given time. The [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md) is set by the [lender](../l/lender.md) and can be based on the borrower’s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md), [business](../b/business.md) profile, and [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).
- **[Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md)**: The borrower can draw down funds as necessary, meaning they can take out [money](../m/money.md) whenever needed, up to the [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md).
- **[Repayment](../r/repayment.md)**: The borrower is required to make regular payments which could be [interest](../i/interest.md)-only or include both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md). If the borrower repays more than the minimum requirement, they can re-borrow that amount again.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) on a revolving [loan](../l/loan.md) [facility](../f/facility.md) is typically variable and often linked to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate such as the LIBOR or [prime rate](../p/prime_rate.md).
- **Fees**: These may include commitment fees, which are charged on the unused portion of the [facility](../f/facility.md), and/or [origination](../o/origination.md) fees, which cover the administrative costs of setting up the [loan](../l/loan.md).

## Types of Revolving Loan Facilities

1. **Committed Revolving [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Facility](../f/facility.md)**: In this type, the [lender](../l/lender.md) is obligated to provide funds up to the specified limit, and the borrower pays a [fee](../f/fee.md) on the unused portion. This type offers reliability and stability but could be more expensive due to fees.
2. **Uncommitted Revolving [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Facility](../f/facility.md)**: Here, the [lender](../l/lender.md) is not obligated to provide funds and can decline requests for drawdowns. These are generally less expensive but [offer](../o/offer.md) less certainty for the borrower.
3. **Revolving [Letter of Credit](../l/letter_of_credit.md)**: This is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that provides the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) with the ability to draw funds as required. It is generally used in international [trade](../t/trade.md) for securing transactions.

## Advantages of Revolving Loan Facilities

- **Flexibility**: Borrowers can access funds as needed and repay them as their [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) allows.
- **Cost-Effective**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) is only paid on the funds actually borrowed, not on the entire [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md).
- **Convenience**: Easy to manage and access compared to obtaining [multiple](../m/multiple.md) short-term loans.
- **Supports [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) Management**: Ideal for managing seasonal fluctuations in [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and expenses.

## Disadvantages of Revolving Loan Facilities

- **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: Variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates mean that the borrowing costs can increase unexpectedly.
- **Fees**: Commitment fees on unused portions can add to the cost of borrowing.
- **[Creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) Requirements**: Lenders often require strong [credit](../c/credit.md) past performance and [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) to approve a revolving [loan](../l/loan.md) [facility](../f/facility.md).
- **Strict Covenants**: Borrowers might face restrictive covenants, including maintaining certain [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) and limits on additional borrowing.

## Usage in Companies

Revolving [loan](../l/loan.md) facilities are commonly used by businesses as part of their [working capital management](../w/working_capital_management.md). For instance, a retail [business](../b/business.md) might use a revolving [loan](../l/loan.md) [facility](../f/facility.md) to cover the costs of [inventory](../i/inventory.md) purchases before the peak shopping season, and then repay the [loan](../l/loan.md) with the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) generated during that period.

## Examples and Case Studies

- **General Electric (GE)**: General Electric often utilizes [revolving credit](../r/revolving_credit.md) facilities to meet short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements and manage working [capital](../c/capital.md) effectively. Without such facilities, GE would find it challenging to maintain the flexibility needed in its diverse and often dynamically changing operational environment.
- **JP Morgan Chase**: JP Morgan offers revolving [loan](../l/loan.md) facilities as part of its corporate banking services, providing both committed and uncommitted revolving lines of [credit](../c/credit.md) to clients.

- **Tech Startups**: Startups in the tech [industry](../i/industry.md) frequently use revolving [loan](../l/loan.md) facilities to manage the volatile [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) associated with R&D expenses and [capital](../c/capital.md) investments. The flexibility allows them to draw funds when [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) infusions are delayed or seasonal [revenue](../r/revenue.md) dips occur.

## Financial and Legal Considerations

When entering into a revolving [loan](../l/loan.md) [facility](../f/facility.md) agreement, companies should conduct thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) to understand all terms and conditions. Legal counsel is often advisable to negotiate terms that can [offer](../o/offer.md) some degree of protection against adverse conditions, such as sudden rate hikes or overly restrictive covenants. Financial considerations should include assessing the total cost of borrowing, including [interest](../i/interest.md) and fees.

For businesses with seasonal cycles or variable operating needs, this financial tool can be a critical part of their financial strategy. However, it is essential to weigh the benefits against the costs and potential risks, such as [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations and fees.

By understanding the structure, benefits, and drawbacks, companies can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals and operational needs.
