# Requote

A requote occurs when a broker or trading platform does not execute a requested trade at the expected price and instead offers a new price. It often happens in fast markets or when liquidity is thin.

## Why it happens
- Rapid price movement between order submission and execution.
- Insufficient liquidity at the requested price.
- Platform or broker execution rules.

## Example
A trader submits a market order to buy a currency pair at 1.1050. The price moves quickly and the broker returns a requote at 1.1053. The trader can accept or reject.

## Practical notes
Requotes are more common in OTC markets and retail platforms. Using limit orders can reduce the chance of requotes.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Requote and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Requote as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Requote, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Requote. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Requote alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
