# Rule of 72

The Rule of 72 is a straightforward and useful formula in [finance](../f/finance.md) that estimates the number of years required to double the [value](../v/value.md) of an investment based on a fixed annual [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md). This rule is widely used due to its simplicity and the rough accuracy it provides for understanding the effects of [compound interest](../c/compound_interest_in_trading.md) over time.

## Understanding the Rule of 72

The Rule of 72 states that you can estimate the doubling time of an investment by dividing 72 by the annual [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (expressed as a percentage). The formula looks like this:

```
Doubling Time (in years) = 72 / Annual [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md)
```

For example, if you have an investment that earns a 6% annual [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), the estimated time to double the investment would be approximately:

```
72 / 6 = 12 years
```

Similarly, for an investment with a 9% [annual return](../a/annual_return.md), it would take:

```
72 / 9 = 8 years
```

## Applications of the Rule of 72

### Personal Finance

Individuals can use the Rule of 72 to make quick estimates on how long it [will](../w/will.md) take for their savings or investments to grow. For instance, if someone has a retirement account with an average [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) of 8%, they can use the Rule of 72 to approximate that their [money](../m/money.md) [will](../w/will.md) double every 9 years.

### Investment Decision-Making

Financial advisors and investors often use the Rule of 72 to evaluate different investment opportunities. By establishing how long it [will](../w/will.md) take for an investment to double, they can more easily compare the attractiveness of various [options](../o/options.md).

### Interest Rates and Loans

The Rule of 72 can also be applied in understanding the impact of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on loans. For instance, if a [debt](../d/debt.md) incurs an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) of 12%, the outstanding balance is likely to double in 6 years (72 divided by 12).

## Limitations and Accuracy

While the Rule of 72 is a useful heuristic, it is not perfectly accurate. The formula is most accurate for [interest](../i/interest.md) rates ranging between 6% and 10%. For very low or high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates, the estimation can be less precise. Therefore, the Rule of 72 is best used for rough calculations and quick assessments rather than precise [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

## The Mathematical Basis of the Rule of 72

The Rule of 72 is derived from the formula for [compound interest](../c/compound_interest_in_trading.md):

```
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
```

Here, `A` is the amount of [money](../m/money.md) accumulated after `n` periods; `P` is the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount (the initial amount of [money](../m/money.md)); `r` is the annual [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md); `n` is the number of times that [interest](../i/interest.md) is compounded per year; and `t` is the number of years the [money](../m/money.md) is invested or borrowed for.

To find out when the investment doubles (i.e., when `A = 2P`), we simplify the formula with [continuous compounding](../c/continuous_compounding.md) (`n` approaches infinity):

```
2 = (1 + r)^t
ln(2) = t*ln(1 + r)
```

For small `r`, `ln(1 + r) ≈ r`, so:

```
ln(2) ≈ t*r
t ≈ ln(2) / r
t ≈ 0.693 / r
```

Since 0.693 is approximately 0.72 (and to simplify, we use 72 instead of more precise values like 69 or 70), the Rule of 72 provides us with:

```
t ≈ 72 / (r * 100)
```

Where `r` is expressed as a percentage.

## Variations and Extensions

### Rule of 70 and Rule of 69.3

Variants of the Rule of 72, such as the [Rule of 70](../r/rule_of_70.md) and Rule of 69.3, [offer](../o/offer.md) slight adjustments to cater for different scenarios. These variations sometimes provide more accurate results for certain ranges of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates or [compounding](../c/compounding.md) frequencies.

### Adjustments for Different Compounding Periods

The Rule of 72 generally assumes annual [compounding](../c/compounding.md). For other [compounding](../c/compounding.md) periods, the formula can still be adapted but with a different divisor. For instance, if [interest](../i/interest.md) is compounded monthly, you might use 78 instead of 72 for a more accurate estimate.

### Beyond Doubling

The Rule of 72 can be modified to estimate tripling or higher multiples by adjusting the numerator. For tripling an investment, you would use the Rule of 114 (since `ln(3)` approximates `1.1`). For quadrupling, the Rule of 144 is used.

## Practical Examples in Financial Markets

### Stock Market Investments

Suppose you invest in a diversified portfolio of [stocks](../s/stock.md) with an average [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) of 7%. Using the Rule of 72:

```
72 / 7 = approximately 10.3 years
```

This means your investment is likely to double in just over 10 years.

### Fixed Income Securities

If you invest in a [bond](../b/bond.md) paying 4% annual [interest](../i/interest.md), the Rule of 72 predicts:

```
72 / 4 = 18 years
```

Thus, it [will](../w/will.md) take 18 years for your [principal](../p/principal.md) to double.

## Important Considerations

### Inflation Adjustment

When using the Rule of 72, it's essential to consider the impact of [inflation](../i/inflation.md) on the real [value](../v/value.md) of [money](../m/money.md). An investment might double in [nominal](../n/nominal.md) terms, but if [inflation](../i/inflation.md) has been high, the real [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of that doubled amount could be significantly less.

### Risk and Return Trade-Offs

The Rule of 72 does not account for [risk](../r/risk.md). Higher returns often come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md), and while the Rule helps in understanding potential growth, it's crucial to balance the [return](../r/return.md) estimates with the associated risks.

### Tax Impact

[Taxes](../t/taxes.md) can significantly affect the growth of investments. The Rule of 72 computation assumes [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) growth, which is rarely the case in real-world scenarios.

### Non-Annual Compounding

If [interest](../i/interest.md) is compounded more frequently than annually (e.g., monthly or quarterly), the doubling time estimated by the Rule of 72 may be less accurate. Various adjustments or alternative rules might be needed for precision.

## Conclusion

The Rule of 72 is a simple yet powerful [rule of thumb](../r/rule_of_thumb.md) aiding in the quick calculation of the doubling time of investments. Its broad application across [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md), [investment analysis](../i/investment_analysis.md), and understanding [loan](../l/loan.md) impacts makes it an indispensable tool for both novices and professionals in the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md). However, users should be aware of its limitations and consider adjustments for higher accuracy in different financial scenarios.
