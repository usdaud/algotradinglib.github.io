# Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE)

### Introduction

[Return](../r/return.md) on Tangible [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROTE) is a key financial metric used in the analysis and evaluation of a company's performance, specifically focusing on the returns generated on [equity](../e/equity.md) excluding intangible assets. Unlike the more commonly referenced [Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROE), which includes all [equity](../e/equity.md) investments, ROTE zeroes in on tangible [equity](../e/equity.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a clearer picture of a company’s potential to generate [income](../i/income.md) from its core, hard assets.

### Definition and Calculation

ROTE is defined as follows:

\[ ROTE = \frac{Net\ Income}{Tangible\ Common\ [Equity](../e/equity.md)} \]

Where:

- **Net [Income](../i/income.md)** is the bottom-line [profit](../p/profit.md) of a company, typically found on the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).
- **Tangible Common [Equity](../e/equity.md) (TCE)** is calculated by subtracting intangible assets and preferred [equity](../e/equity.md) from the total shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md).

\[ TCE = Total\ [Equity](../e/equity.md) - Intangible\ Assets - Preferred\ [Equity](../e/equity.md) \]

### Components of ROTE

#### Net Income
Net [Income](../i/income.md), also known as the net [profit](../p/profit.md) or the [bottom line](../b/bottom_line.md), represents the company’s [earnings](../e/earnings.md) after all expenses have been deducted from revenues. It includes operating expenses, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), [interest](../i/interest.md), and [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md). It's a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of profitability and is typically found at the bottom of the company’s [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).

#### Tangible Common Equity (TCE)
Tangible Common [Equity](../e/equity.md) is the [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) of a company that excludes intangible assets such as [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md), patents, and trademarks. These assets are subtracted because they can be subjective and volatile, which may not accurately reflect the company's ability to generate tangible returns. TCE provides a more conservative and realistic measure of a company’s [equity](../e/equity.md) available to absorb losses.

### Importance of ROTE

1. **Focused Evaluation**: By excluding intangible assets, ROTE focuses solely on the returns generated from [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md), providing a clearer picture of [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and [asset](../a/asset.md) [productivity](../p/productivity.md).
2. **[Comparative Analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md)**: ROTE allows for better comparisons across companies within the same [industry](../i/industry.md), especially those with significant intangible assets like tech companies or firms heavily invested in R&D.
3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment**: Intangible assets can be harder to assess and may carry higher [risk](../r/risk.md). By excluding them, ROTE offers insights into the more stable and assessable portions of a company's [equity](../e/equity.md).
4. **[Performance Benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md)**: Investors and analysts use ROTE to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) a company's performance against its peers and historical data, aiding in investment decisions and strategic analysis.

### Limitations of ROTE

1. **Ignores Intangible [Value](../v/value.md)**: For companies whose [value](../v/value.md) is significantly derived from intangible assets, such as tech companies, ignoring these can undervalue their true potential and performance.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions Impact**: In volatile markets, the [value](../v/value.md) of [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) may fluctuate, potentially distorting the ROTE calculation.
3. **[Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Variations**: Different [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards and practices can affect the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of tangible and intangible assets, complicating [comparative analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md).

### Case Study: JPMorgan Chase

#### Company Overview
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is one of the largest financial institutions in the world, providing a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial services including [investment banking](../i/investment_banking.md), financial services for consumers and businesses, financial [transaction](../t/transaction.md) processing, [asset management](../a/asset_management.md), and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md).


#### ROTE Analysis
In their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), JPMorgan Chase reports both net [income](../i/income.md) and tangible common [equity](../e/equity.md), making it easier to calculate and analyze their ROTE. For instance, in 2022, their reported net [income](../i/income.md) was approximately $48 billion, and their tangible common [equity](../e/equity.md) was around $200 billion. Thus, their ROTE can be calculated as follows:

\[ ROTE = \frac{48\ billion}{200\ billion} \times 100 = 24\% \]

This indicates that JPMorgan Chase generated a 24% [return](../r/return.md) on its tangible [equity](../e/equity.md), showcasing its ability to generate substantial [income](../i/income.md) from its [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md).

### Comparing ROTE with ROE

While ROTE focuses on tangible [equity](../e/equity.md), [Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROE) includes all [equity](../e/equity.md) components. Here's how they differ and why each is important:

- **ROE = \(\frac{Net\ [Income](../i/income.md)}{Total\ [Equity](../e/equity.md)}\)**: Includes both tangible and intangible assets, providing a broader measure of a company’s overall [equity](../e/equity.md) performance.
- **ROTE = \(\frac{Net\ [Income](../i/income.md)}{Tangible\ Common\ [Equity](../e/equity.md)}\)**: Excludes intangible assets, [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into the performance of tangible-[capital](../c/capital.md) intensive operations.

##### Example: Tech Company Analysis
For a tech company like Apple Inc., with significant intangible assets from intellectual property and brand [value](../v/value.md), ROE may include a substantial portion of [equity](../e/equity.md) attributed to these intangibles. However, ROTE would exclude these, focusing on returns from [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md), which might undervalue their performance due to their heavy reliance on intangibles for [revenue](../r/revenue.md) generation.

### Practical Applications of ROTE

#### Investment Decision
Investors often use ROTE to make informed decisions, especially in sectors where [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) significantly drive profitability, such as banking and [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md). By comparing ROTE across companies, investors can identify firms that efficiently utilize their tangible [equity](../e/equity.md) to generate returns.

#### Performance Benchmarking
Companies use ROTE to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) their performance against [industry](../i/industry.md) standards or historical data. This assists in evaluating the effectiveness of their strategies and making necessary adjustments to improve tangible [asset](../a/asset.md) utilization.

#### Risk Management
By focusing on [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md), ROTE helps in assessing the [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of a company. [Tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) typically have more predictable values and can be more easily liquidated in case of [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md), providing a safety cushion for [equity](../e/equity.md) investors.

### Conclusion

[Return](../r/return.md) on Tangible [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROTE) is a vital metric for [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a focused view of a company's ability to generate returns from its [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md). While it has its limitations, particularly for companies with significant intangible assets, it remains a crucial tool for investors, analysts, and corporate managers to assess [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md), identify strategic improvements, and make informed investment decisions.
