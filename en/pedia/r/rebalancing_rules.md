# Rebalancing Rules

[Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) is a crucial concept in the domain of investment [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It involves adjusting the weights of assets within a portfolio to maintain a desired level of [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) or [risk](../r/risk.md). This activity ensures that the portfolio remains aligned with the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s target allocation, strategy, and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) over time.

## Why Rebalancing is Important

### Control of Risk
[Asset](../a/asset.md) prices are subject to fluctuation. Over time, these fluctuations can cause a portfolio to deviate significantly from its target allocation. For example, if equities are performing exceptionally well compared to bonds, an [equity](../e/equity.md)-heavy portfolio might become riskier than intended. [Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) helps in controlling such unintended risks by restoring the target allocation.

### Performance Improvement
Though [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) primarily aims at [risk control](../r/risk_control.md), it can also potentially enhance long-term performance. By systematically selling high and buying low, [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) can capture gains from [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Behavioral Discipline
[Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) imposes a disciplined approach to investment and keeps emotional decisions at bay. It encourages buying underperforming assets and selling outperforming ones, countering the common [investor](../i/investor.md) behavior of panic-selling during [market](../m/market.md) declines and overbuying during [market](../m/market.md) peaks.

## Types of Rebalancing Rules

### Periodic Rebalancing
Periodic [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) involves adjusting the portfolio at regular intervals, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. This method is straightforward and predictable, making it easier for investors to plan.

### Threshold-Based Rebalancing
Threshold-based [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md), also known as tolerance band, triggers portfolio adjustments when [asset](../a/asset.md) weights deviate by a certain percentage from their target. For instance, if an [asset class](../a/asset_class.md) deviates by more than 5% from its target allocation, [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) is initiated.

### Hybrid Rebalancing
Hybrid [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) combines periodic and threshold-based techniques. Portfolios are reviewed at regular intervals, and [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) occurs if the assets have deviated beyond set thresholds.

### Dynamic Rebalancing
Dynamic [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) involves continuous monitoring and can be executed using [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies that automatically adjust the portfolio based on real-time data.

## Steps Involved in Rebalancing

1. **Assess Current Allocation**: Review the current weights of assets in the portfolio.
2. **Compare with Target Allocation**: Identify the differences between current weights and target weights.
3. **Calculate Required Adjustments**: Determine the trades needed to realign the portfolio with its target allocation.
4. **Implement Adjustments**: Execute the required trades to buy or sell assets.
5. **Review and Iterate**: Periodically review the portfolio to ensure it remains in line with the set objectives.

## Rebalancing Strategies in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) utilizes automated systems to execute [rebalancing strategies](../r/rebalancing_strategies.md) efficiently and with precision. Below are a few common strategies:

### Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)
[Mean-variance optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md) aims to maximize returns for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md) or minimize [risk](../r/risk.md) for a given [return](../r/return.md) level. Developed by [Harry Markowitz](../h/harry_markowitz.md), this strategy calculates the optimal [asset](../a/asset.md) weights that should be held in a portfolio. Algorithms can use MVO to dynamically adjust portfolios.

### Risk Parity
[Risk parity](../r/risk_parity.md) focuses on equalizing the [risk](../r/risk.md) contribution from each [asset class](../a/asset_class.md) in a portfolio. Helps in constructing a balanced portfolio where [risk](../r/risk.md), rather than [capital](../c/capital.md), is evenly spread across assets.

### Minimum Variance Portfolio
The minimum variance portfolio strategy targets constructing a portfolio with the lowest possible [risk](../r/risk.md). Algorithms calculate the weightings that minimize overall portfolio [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Challenges in Rebalancing

### Transaction Costs
Frequent [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) incurs [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) that can erode portfolio returns. Strategies must balance the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between maintaining target allocation and minimizing costs.

### Tax Implications
In taxable accounts, selling assets to rebalance can trigger [capital](../c/capital.md) gains [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Tax-efficient [rebalancing strategies](../r/rebalancing_strategies.md) involve considering the tax impact and potentially using tax-loss harvesting to [offset](../o/offset.md) gains.

### Market Impact
Large trades necessary for [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) can affect [market](../m/market.md) prices, especially for illiquid assets. Algorithms must be designed to minimize the [market](../m/market.md) impact of trades.
