# Rollover Cost

Rollover cost is the cost or benefit of moving a position from one futures contract month to the next. It reflects the price difference between the two contracts and can be positive or negative.

## Drivers
- Contango or backwardation in the futures curve.
- Interest rates, storage costs, and convenience yield.
- Supply and demand dynamics for the underlying.

## Example
A trader rolls a long crude oil position from May to June. The June contract is higher than May, creating a negative roll yield or cost.

## Practical notes
Rollover cost can be a significant part of long term futures returns. Strategies should account for roll yield in performance analysis.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Rollover Cost and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Rollover Cost as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Rollover Cost, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Rollover Cost. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Rollover Cost alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
