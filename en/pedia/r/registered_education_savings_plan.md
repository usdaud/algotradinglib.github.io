# Registered Education Savings Plan

A Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) is a [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md) designed to encourage saving for post-secondary education in Canada. RESPs [offer](../o/offer.md) various benefits and features that make them an attractive option for parents and guardians looking to [fund](../f/fund.md) their children's higher education.

## What is an RESP?

An RESP is a government-registered account where Canadian parents, grandparents, and guardians can save [money](../m/money.md) for their children's future education. Contributions to an RESP are not tax-deductible, but the investments within the plan can grow [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) until the funds are withdrawn.

When the recipient (usually the child) enrolls in a post-secondary educational institution, they can withdraw the funds to cover educational expenses. These withdrawals are typically subject to the student’s [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md), which is often lower than that of the contributor.

## Types of RESPs

There are three main types of RESPs:

1. **Family Plan**: Allows one or more beneficiaries who are related to the contributor by blood or adoption. This plan is beneficial for families with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) children.

2. **Individual Plan**: Designed for a single [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md). This type of plan is ideal if you’re saving for one child only.

3. **Group Plan**: Typically offered by financial institutions or scholarship plan dealers. Contributions from various subscribers are pooled together and invested collectively. The amount a [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) receives depends on how much is collected in the pool and the number of beneficiaries in the same age group enrolled in the plan.

## Contributions to an RESP

Contributions to an RESP can be made by anyone, but there are certain limits and restrictions:

- **Lifetime Contribution Limit**: The maximum you can contribute to an RESP is $50,000 per [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md).
- **No Annual Contribution Limit**: Unlike other registered accounts, there is no annual limit for RESP contributions.
- **Contribution Deadline**: Contributions can be made until the end of the 31st year after the year the RESP was opened.

## Government Grants and Incentives

One of the most significant advantages of an RESP is the availability of government grants that can augment the savings, including:

### Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)

The CESG is a [grant](../g/grant.md) from the federal government to encourage saving for post-secondary education. There are two types of CESG:

1. **Basic CESG**: Provides 20% on the first $2,500 contributed each year, up to a maximum of $500 per year. The lifetime limit for the Basic CESG is $7,200 per [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md).

2. **Additional CESG**: Available to low and middle-[income](../i/income.md) families, this [grant](../g/grant.md) provides an extra 10% or 20% on the first $500 contributed each year.

### Canada Learning Bond (CLB)

The CLB is offered to low-[income](../i/income.md) families and does not require any contributions to qualify. The government provides an initial $500 when the RESP is first opened, and $100 each year for up to 15 years, with a maximum lifetime [bond](../b/bond.md) of $2,000.

### Provincial Grants

Certain provinces also [offer](../o/offer.md) additional incentives. For instance, British Columbia provides the BC Training and Education Savings [Grant](../g/grant.md), and Quebec offers the Quebec Education Savings Incentive.

## Investment Options Within an RESP

RESPs can [hold](../h/hold.md) various types of investments, including:

- **Mutual Funds**
- **[Stocks](../s/stock.md) and Bonds**
- **GICs (Guaranteed Investment Certificates)**
- **ETFs ([Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds)**

The [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) can be tailored based on the age of the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) and the [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md) for needing the funds. Typically, more aggressive investments are chosen when the child is younger, transitioning to safer, fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investments as the time for post-secondary education approaches.

## Withdrawing from an RESP

Withdrawals from an RESP are categorized into two main types:

### Educational Assistance Payments (EAPs)

EAPs consist of government grants and the accumulated [income](../i/income.md) on both contributions and grants. These payments are made to the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) for qualifying educational expenses, such as tuition, books, and living expenses. EAPs are taxable in the hands of the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md).

### Refund of Contributions

This consists of the original contributions made to the RESP, which can be withdrawn [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) by the contributor at any time. However, if the CESG or other grants are withdrawn without being used for educational expenses, they [will](../w/will.md) have to be repaid to the government.

## Flexibility and Transferability

RESPs [offer](../o/offer.md) some level of flexibility and transferability. If the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) does not pursue post-secondary education, the contributions can be transferred to another eligible [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md). Additionally, up to $50,000 can be transferred to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) of the subscriber if certain conditions are met.

## RESP Providers

RESPs can be opened through various financial institutions, such as banks, [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, and [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) companies. It is essential to compare the [options](../o/options.md) and fees associated with different providers before setting up an RESP.

In conclusion, an RESP is an excellent tool for Canadian families to save for future educational expenses. The combination of [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) growth and government grants makes it a compelling option for long-term savings. Understanding the types, contributions, grants, investments, and [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) rules is crucial to maximizing the benefits an RESP can [offer](../o/offer.md).
