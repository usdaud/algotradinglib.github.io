# Return To Risk Ratio

Return to risk ratio compares the expected or realized return of a trade to the amount of risk taken. It is used to assess whether a trade offers sufficient reward for its risk.

## Basic formula
Return to Risk = Potential Profit / Potential Loss

## Example
A trade targets a 6 point gain with a 2 point stop. The return to risk ratio is 3 to 1.

## Practical notes
A high ratio does not guarantee a good trade if the probability of success is low. Traders balance the ratio with win rate and strategy edge.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Return To Risk Ratio and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Return To Risk Ratio as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Return To Risk Ratio, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Return To Risk Ratio. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Return To Risk Ratio alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
