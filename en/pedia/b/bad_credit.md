# Bad Credit

## Introduction
Bad [credit](../c/credit.md) refers to a person’s poor history of paying their debts on time and the likelihood that they [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md) on their financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md). It is often represented by a low [credit score](../c/credit_score.md). This condition can make it difficult for an individual to obtain loans, [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, and other forms of [credit](../c/credit.md), and when [credit](../c/credit.md) is extended, it often comes with higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Understanding Credit Scores
[Credit](../c/credit.md) scores are numerical expressions based on a level analysis of a person's [credit](../c/credit.md) files, representing the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of that person. The most commonly used [credit](../c/credit.md) scores in the United States are FICO scores and VantageScores. These scores [range](../r/range.md) from 300 to 850, with scores below 600 typically being considered bad [credit](../c/credit.md).

### Factors Affecting Credit Scores

1. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) History**: This includes overdue payments, bankruptcies, and charge-offs.
2. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Level**: The amount of [debt](../d/debt.md) an individual has, especially in relation to their available [credit](../c/credit.md), is significant.
3. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) History Length**: The longer the [credit](../c/credit.md) history, the better, provided it includes timely payments.
4. **New [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: Opening [multiple](../m/multiple.md) new [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts in a short period can negatively affect a [credit score](../c/credit_score.md).
5. **Types of [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: A diverse mix of [credit](../c/credit.md) types (e.g., [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, mortgages, and installment loans) can positively influence a score.
