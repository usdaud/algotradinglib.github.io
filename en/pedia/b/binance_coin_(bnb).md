# Binance Coin (BNB)

[Binance](../b/binance.md) Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency created by [Binance](../b/binance.md), one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Launched in 2017, BNB has grown to become one of the most prominent digital assets, mainly due to its wide adoption within the [Binance](../b/binance.md) ecosystem and beyond. In this detailed analysis, we [will](../w/will.md) explore various aspects of [Binance](../b/binance.md) Coin, from its inception to its technical specifications, use cases, and impact on the broader cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md).

## Introduction to Binance Coin (BNB)

[Binance](../b/binance.md) Coin was launched in July 2017 during an Initial Coin [Offering](../o/offering.md) (ICO). Initially, BNB was an ERC-20 token running on the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). However, in April 2019, [Binance](../b/binance.md) launched its own [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), [Binance](../b/binance.md) Chain, and BNB migrated to become the native coin of this new ecosystem. BNB powers [multiple](../m/multiple.md) functions within the [Binance](../b/binance.md) ecosystem and plays a crucial role in the operations and services offered by [Binance](../b/binance.md).

## Binance Ecosystem and BNB Utility

BNB has a variety of use cases primarily centered around the [Binance](../b/binance.md) ecosystem. Here are some of the main functions and utilities of [Binance](../b/binance.md) Coin:

### Trading Fee Discount

One of the most significant use cases for BNB is its ability to [offer](../o/offer.md) trading [fee](../f/fee.md) discounts on the [Binance](../b/binance.md) [exchange](../e/exchange.md). Users can choose to pay their trading fees using BNB instead of the [default](../d/default.md) cryptocurrency being traded. Initially, [Binance](../b/binance.md) offers a 50% [discount](../d/discount.md) in the first year, which gradually decreases over time.

### Binance Launchpad and Participations

[Binance](../b/binance.md) Launchpad is a platform for hosting token sales of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) projects. Users can participate in these sales using BNB. This feature has helped numerous [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) startups [gain](../g/gain.md) [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and funding, while also benefiting BNB holders by providing them with access to new investment opportunities.

### Transaction Fees on Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain

BNB is used as the native token for paying [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) on [Binance](../b/binance.md) Chain and [Binance](../b/binance.md) Smart Chain (BSC). [Binance](../b/binance.md) Smart Chain, in particular, has gained popularity for its low fees and high performance, competing with other smart contract platforms like [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md).

### Staking and Yield Farming

BNB can be staked in various DeFi protocols available on the [Binance](../b/binance.md) Smart Chain. Staking allows users to earn rewards for participating in the network's [security](../s/security.md) and operations. Additionally, [yield](../y/yield.md) farming opportunities enable BNB holders to earn more tokens by providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to decentralized exchanges or lending platforms.

### Binance Visa Card

Users can also use BNB to pay for goods and services with the [Binance](../b/binance.md) [Visa Card](../v/visa_card.md). This card allows users to convert their BNB into fiat [currency](../c/currency.md) at the point of [sale](../s/sale.md), making it spendable in everyday transactions.

### Other Uses

BNB is also integrated into various other platforms and services, such as DApps, [payment](../p/payment.md) gateways, and decentralized [finance](../f/finance.md) (DeFi) solutions. Its widespread adoption makes it a versatile and valuable cryptocurrency.

## Technical Specifications

Here are some key technical details about [Binance](../b/binance.md) Coin:

- **Total [Supply](../s/supply.md)**: The initial total [supply](../s/supply.md) of BNB was capped at 200 million coins. However, [Binance](../b/binance.md) performs periodic "coin burns" to reduce the [supply](../s/supply.md) and create [scarcity](../s/scarcity.md).
- **Consensus Mechanism**: [Binance](../b/binance.md) Chain uses a combination of Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanisms.
- **Block Time**: On [Binance](../b/binance.md) Chain, blocks are generated approximately every one second.
