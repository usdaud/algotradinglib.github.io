# Buy the Rumor, Sell the News

Buy the rumor, sell the news describes a market behavior where prices rise ahead of a widely anticipated event and then fall after the event occurs, even if the news is positive.

## Why It Happens
Market expectations are often priced in before the event. When the news is released, traders take profits, causing a reversal or a pause in the trend.

## Trading Implications
Traders watch for pre-event momentum and post-event reversals. The pattern is common around earnings releases, economic data, and policy announcements.

## Risks
The pattern does not occur consistently. If the news outcome is a surprise, prices can continue in the same direction. Risk management and confirmation are critical.

## Drivers

Behavioral patterns arise from positioning, expectations, and risk management rules. Crowded trades and high leverage increase the chance of forced exits and rapid moves.

## Typical Price Path

These moves often start with a catalyst, then accelerate as stop orders and margin calls are triggered. Once forced flow ends, prices can mean revert or stabilize.

## How Traders Use It

Traders look for signs of crowded positioning and catalysts that can force unwinds. Entries are often timed around breaks of key levels or sudden volume spikes.

## Risk and False Signals

Not every sharp move is a squeeze or news reversal. False signals are common when liquidity is thin or when the catalyst is misread. Tight risk controls are essential.

## Example Scenario

Consider a liquid instrument with stable spreads and average volatility. A rule based implementation can be tested on a multi year sample and then on an out of sample period. The goal is to verify that the behavior of Buy the Rumor, Sell the News is consistent across regimes and that the edge does not depend on a narrow set of conditions.

## Implementation Checklist

- Confirm data quality and consistent timestamps
- Define entry and exit rules in plain language
- Validate position sizing and risk limits
- Track execution costs and slippage
- Review performance by regime and by instrument

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
