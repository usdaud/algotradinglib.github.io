# Brazilian Stock Exchange (B3)

## Introduction
The Brazilian Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), known as B3 (Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão), is the main financial [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in Brazil. It was established in March 2017 as a result of the [merger](../m/merger.md) between BM&FBOVESPA (Bolsa de Valores, Mercadorias & Futuros de São Paulo) and CETIP (Central de Custódia e de Liquidação Financeira de Títulos). B3 is one of the largest and most influential stock exchanges in the world and is situated in São Paulo, Brazil.

## History and Formation
### BM&FBOVESPA
BM&FBOVESPA was formed in 2008 after the [merger](../m/merger.md) of the São Paulo Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (Bovespa) and the Brazilian Mercantile & [Futures](../f/futures.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (BM&F). Bovespa, which was founded in 1890, was Brazil’s largest securities [exchange](../e/exchange.md) providing trading in equities, ETFs, and other assets. BM&F, on the other hand, focused on [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md) trading.

### CETIP
CETIP was Brazil's largest [depository](../d/depository.md) of private fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities and the leading clearinghouse for [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and OTC products.
