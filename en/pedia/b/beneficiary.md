# Beneficiary

In the context of trading and financial systems, the term "beneficiary" refers to an individual or entity that is entitled to receive financial advantage or profits from assets, investments, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies, or other financial contracts. The concept of a beneficiary is crucial as it determines the entities or individuals who [will](../w/will.md) receive the benefits in various scenarios including trading accounts, [trust](../t/trust.md) funds, and settlements of wills.

### Types of Beneficiaries

1. **Primary and Contingent Beneficiaries**:
 - **Primary Beneficiary**: The main individual or entity designated to receive the benefit.
 - **[Contingent Beneficiary](../c/contingent_beneficiary.md)**: The individual or entity that receives the benefit if the primary beneficiary is unable to.

2. **Revocable and Irrevocable Beneficiaries**:
 - **[Revocable Beneficiary](../r/revocable_beneficiary.md)**: The beneficiary designation can be altered or revoked by the owner of the investment or policy.
 - **[Irrevocable Beneficiary](../i/irrevocable_beneficiary.md)**: Once named, the beneficiary designation cannot easily be changed without the consent of the beneficiary.

### Importance of Beneficiaries in Financial Planning

Designating a beneficiary is a crucial step in financial and [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md). It ensures that assets are distributed according to the wishes of the individual. Lack of clear beneficiary designations can lead to disputes or the involvement of courts to decide the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of assets.

### Common Scenarios Involving Beneficiaries

- **Pensions and Retirement Accounts**: Beneficiaries of retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs receive the funds upon the account holder's death.
- **[Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) Policies**: [Life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) contracts require designation of beneficiaries who [will](../w/will.md) receive the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md).
- **Wills and Trusts**: Beneficiaries are named in wills and living trusts to ensure assets are distributed according to the deceased's wishes.
- **[Bank](../b/bank.md) Accounts and Investments**: Payable-on-Death (POD) and Transfer-on-Death (TOD) designations can be used on [bank](../b/bank.md) and brokerage accounts to automatically transfer assets upon death.

### Legal Considerations

Naming beneficiaries involves legal considerations:
- **[Estate](../e/estate.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: Beneficiaries may be subject to [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), although specific tax rules vary by jurisdiction.
- **Legal Disputes**: Clear, updated beneficiary designations help mitigate potential legal disputes after the death of the [asset](../a/asset.md) owner.
- **Incapacity**: In case of the account holder's incapacity, having designated beneficiaries can simplify the process of [asset](../a/asset.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

### Algorithms and Automated Trading

In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), the role of beneficiaries can be related to firms or individuals who benefit from the [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). When a [firm](../f/firm.md) engages in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md)—developing and deploying algorithms to execute trades at high speed—profits generated from these trades benefit the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s stakeholders or investors.
