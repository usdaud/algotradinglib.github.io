# Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) is a powerful strategy for the [optimization](../o/optimization.md) of black-box functions, which are functions with inputs that are either continuous or discrete, where the objective function is expensive to evaluate. This approach is extensively utilized in fields such as [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), hyperparameter tuning, and automated [algorithm design](../a/algorithm_design.md), where the cost of function evaluation is high.

## Fundamental Concept

At its core, Bayesian [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) constructs a probabilistic model—the surrogate model—of the objective function and uses this model to make decisions about where in the input space to evaluate next. The primary components of Bayesian [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) include:

1. **Surrogate Model:** This is a probabilistic model that approximates the objective function. [Gaussian Processes](../g/gaussian_processes.md) (GPs) are commonly used as surrogate models due to their flexibility and capability to capture [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).

2. **[Acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) Function:** This function determines the next point to evaluate by trading off exploration (searching in less explored areas) and exploitation (searching in promising areas). Common [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) functions include Expected Improvement (EI), Probability of Improvement (PI), and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB).

3. **Bayes Theorem:** This theorem is fundamental to Bayesian methods, allowing the surrogate model to update its beliefs about the objective function as new data points are evaluated.

## Gaussian Processes

A Gaussian Process (GP) is a collection of [random variables](../r/random_variables.md), any finite number of which have a [joint](../j/joint.md) [Gaussian distribution](../g/gaussian_distribution.md). In the context of Bayesian [Optimization](../o/optimization.md), GPs are favored because they can provide not only predictions of the function values at unsampled points but also quantify the [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) of these predictions. The GP is defined by a mean function, typically assumed to be zero, and a [covariance](../c/covariance.md) function (or kernel), which determines the smoothness and other properties of the function.

### Key Concepts in GPs:

1. **Kernel Function:** Determines the similarity between points in the input space. Common choices include the Radial [Basis](../b/basis.md) Function (RBF) kernel, the Matérn kernel, and the Polynomial kernel.
2. **Mean Function:** Provides the [expected value](../e/expected_value.md) of the function. Often assumed to be zero for simplicity.
3. **Posterior [Distribution](../d/distribution.md):** Given prior information and observed data, the posterior [distribution](../d/distribution.md) provides an updated probabilistic prediction of the objective function.
4. **Marginal Likelihood:** Used for hyperparameter [optimization](../o/optimization.md) within the Gaussian Process.

## Acquisition Functions

The [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) function guides the search for the optimum by suggesting the next point to evaluate. It balances the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between exploration and exploitation.

### Types of Acquisition Functions:

1. **Expected Improvement (EI):** Calculates the expected improvement over the current best observation.
2. **Probability of Improvement (PI):** Measures the probability that a new observation [will](../w/will.md) improve upon the current best [value](../v/value.md).
3. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Considers the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between the predicted mean and the [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) of the function.

## Bayesian Optimization Process

The iterative process of Bayesian [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) involves:

1. **Initialization:** Start with an initial set of observations, often chosen via Latin Hypercube [Sampling](../s/sampling.md) or simple random [sampling](../s/sampling.md).
2. **Surrogate Model Fitting:** Fit the surrogate model, such as the GP, to the current observations.
3. **[Acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) Function [Optimization](../o/optimization.md):** Optimize the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) function to determine the next point for evaluation.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the objective function at the suggested point and update the observation dataset.

This process repeats until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of evaluations or convergence within a predefined threshold.

## Applications

Bayesian [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) has found applications in diverse domains due to its [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in optimizing expensive and noisy [objective functions](../o/objective_functions_in_trading.md):

### Hyperparameter Tuning

In [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), Bayesian [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) is often used for hyperparameter tuning, where the objective function is the performance of a [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) model, and the evaluations are the results of training the model with different hyperparameter settings.

### Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)

[AutoML](../a/automl.md) frameworks employ Bayesian [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) to automate the selection and tuning of [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models, leading to faster and more reliable deployment of [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) solutions.
