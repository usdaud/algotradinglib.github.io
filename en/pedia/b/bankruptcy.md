# Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding involving a person or [business](../b/business.md) that is unable to repay their outstanding debts. The bankruptcy process begins with a petition filed by the debtor, or on behalf of creditors, which is less common. All of the debtor's assets are measured and evaluated, and they may be used to repay a portion of the outstanding [debt](../d/debt.md).

Bankruptcies can generally be divided into two types: [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) and [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md). [Liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) involves the complete [sale](../s/sale.md) of the debtor's non-exempt assets to repay creditors. This type of bankruptcy is also known as "straight bankruptcy." [Reorganization](../r/reorganization.md), on the other hand, allows the debtor to keep their property and use their future [income](../i/income.md) to pay [obligations](../o/obligation.md) over time, under the court-approved [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan.

## Types of Bankruptcy

### Chapter 7 Bankruptcy

Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code entails the [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) of a company's assets, managed by a [trustee](../t/trustee.md) appointed by the court. The [trustee](../t/trustee.md) sells off the assets and distributes the proceeds to the creditors. This type of bankruptcy can apply to individuals, partnerships, or corporations. It's often referred to as "straight" or "simple" bankruptcy. The major eligibility criterion for Chapter 7 is passing the means test, which assesses the debtor's financial condition.

#### Steps in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy

1. **Filing the Petition**: The debtor must file a petition with the bankruptcy court. This petition includes comprehensive details about the debtor's financial situation.
2. **Automatic Stay**: An automatic stay is immediately granted upon filing, preventing creditors from initiating collection efforts.
3. **[Trustee](../t/trustee.md) Appointment**: The court appoints a [trustee](../t/trustee.md) to oversee the case.
4. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) [Liquidation](../l/liquidation.md)**: Non-exempt assets are sold by the [trustee](../t/trustee.md).
5. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Discharge**: Eligible debts are discharged, meaning the debtor is no longer legally required to pay them.


### Chapter 11 Bankruptcy

Chapter 11 is primarily used by corporations and partnerships but can also be availed by individuals whose [debt](../d/debt.md) is beyond the limits of Chapter 13 bankruptcy. This type allows the debtor to propose a plan to restructure [debt](../d/debt.md) while continuing to operate the [business](../b/business.md). The debtor has an exclusive period during which only they can propose the [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) plan, usually 120 days post-filing.

#### Steps in Chapter 11 Bankruptcy

1. **Filing the Petition**: Similar to Chapter 7, the first step is filing a detailed petition.
2. **Automatic Stay**: An automatic stay prevents creditors from continuing collection activities.
3. **Debtor-in-Possession**: The debtor usually continues to run the [business](../b/business.md).
4. **Plan Proposal**: The debtor proposes a [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md) plan, which must be approved by the creditors and the court.
5. **Plan Confirmation**: The court confirms the plan, and the debtor begins to repay creditors according to the plan's terms.


### Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

Chapter 13 is designed for individuals with a regular [income](../i/income.md) who can repay all or part of their debts over a three- to five-year period. Unlike Chapter 7, this type does not involve liquidating assets but requires setting up a [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan.

#### Steps in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

1. **Filing the Petition**: The procedure begins with filing a detailed petition.
2. **Automatic Stay**: An automatic stay is issued to halt collection actions.
3. **[Trustee](../t/trustee.md) Appointment**: A [trustee](../t/trustee.md) is appointed to oversee the case.
4. **Plan Development**: The debtor proposes a [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan, which must meet specific requirements and be approved by the court.
5. **Plan [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Payments are made to the [trustee](../t/trustee.md), who distributes them to creditors according to the plan.


## Causes of Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy can result from a myriad of factors, both external and internal to the [business](../b/business.md) or individual:

1. **Economic Downturns**: Recessions can significantly impact businesses and individuals, causing a sharp reduction in [income](../i/income.md) or revenues.
2. **Poor [Financial Planning](../f/financial_planning.md)**: Lack of proper budgeting and [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) can lead to over-[leverage](../l/leverage.md) and eventual [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md).
3. **High Personal [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Excessive use of [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, loans, and other forms of [credit](../c/credit.md) can lead to unmanageable [debt](../d/debt.md) levels.
4. **Unexpected Expenses**: Medical emergencies, legal issues, or significant repair expenses can push individuals into bankruptcy.
5. **[Business](../b/business.md) Failures**: Operational issues, poor management, and intense competition can cause companies to [fail](../f/fail.md).
6. **Divorce and Legal Issues**: Personal legal battles and divorce can deplete financial resources.

## Consequences of Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy has significant repercussions for both individuals and businesses:

1. **[Credit Score](../c/credit_score.md) Impact**: Filing for bankruptcy severely impacts [credit](../c/credit.md) scores, making it difficult to obtain [credit](../c/credit.md) in the future.
2. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) Loss**: In [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) bankruptcies, debtors may lose significant assets to repay creditors.
3. **Public Record**: Bankruptcies are public records and can affect personal and professional reputations.
4. **Legal Restrictions**: Bankruptcies can impose legal restrictions on the ability to obtain new [credit](../c/credit.md), subject to court approvals.
5. **Loss of Control**: In Chapter 11, the court oversees the [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md), which can limit the autonomy of [business](../b/business.md) owners.

## Alternatives to Bankruptcy

Before filing for bankruptcy, individuals and businesses can explore various alternatives to manage their debts:

1. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Counseling**: Professional [credit](../c/credit.md) counselors provide financial advice and [debt](../d/debt.md) management plans.
2. **[Debt Consolidation](../d/debt_consolidation.md)**: Combining [multiple](../m/multiple.md) debts into a single [loan](../l/loan.md) with lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can make [repayment](../r/repayment.md) more manageable.
3. **Negotiating with Creditors**: Negotiating new terms with creditors can provide temporary relief or more favorable [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plans.
4. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Settlement**: Settling debts for less than the full amount can relieve some financial pressure.
5. **Re-budgeting**: Reevaluating budgets and expenses to cut down on unnecessary costs and free up resources for [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md).

## Key Players in Bankruptcy Proceedings

Several key players are involved in bankruptcy proceedings:

1. **Debtor**: The entity (individual or [business](../b/business.md)) filing for bankruptcy.
2. **Creditors**: Individuals or entities to whom the debtor owes [money](../m/money.md).
3. **[Trustee](../t/trustee.md)**: An appointed person who administers the bankruptcy case and ensures that creditors are paid as much as possible from the debtor's assets.
4. **Bankruptcy Judge**: The judge who oversees the proceedings, ensures that laws are adhered to, and makes key legal determinations.
5. **Bankruptcy Attorney**: Legal professionals specializing in bankruptcy law, representing either the debtor or creditors.

## International Bankruptcy Laws
