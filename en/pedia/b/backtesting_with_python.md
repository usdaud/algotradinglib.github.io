# Backtesting with Python

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) is a critical concept in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It involves testing a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) on historical data to evaluate its performance. By simulating the strategy on past data, traders can get a sense of how the strategy might perform in real-world trading scenarios without risking actual [capital](../c/capital.md).

Python has become one of the go-to languages for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) due to its extensive libraries and frameworks tailored for [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and trading automation. Below, we delve into the essentials of [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) using Python, including key libraries, concepts, and a sample implementation.

## Basic Concepts in Backtesting

Before we dive into Python specifics, it's important to understand some fundamental concepts of [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md):

- **Historical Data**: Time-series data for the financial instruments you're interested in. This can include price, [volume](../v/volume.md), and other [market indicators](../m/market_indicators.md).
- **Strategy Logic**: The rules and logic that define your [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md). This can be based on [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), statistical models, or other criteria.
- **[Performance Metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md)**: Metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of your strategy. Common metrics include Net [Profit](../p/profit.md), [Return](../r/return.md) on Investment (ROI), [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md), etc.
- **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: Consideration of fees, [spreads](../s/spreads.md), and [slippage](../s/slippage.md) that occur during real trading.

## Popular Python Libraries for Backtesting

## Basic Steps to Implement a Backtesting Strategy

Here's a simplified workflow for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) in Python:

1. **Data [Acquisition](../a/acquisition.md)**: Acquire historical data for the [asset](../a/asset.md) you want to backtest.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data by cleaning and transforming it as needed.
3. **Define the Strategy**: Implement the trading logic.
4. **Run Backtest**: Apply the strategy to historical data.
5. **Evaluate Performance**: Analyze the results using [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).
6. **[Optimization](../o/optimization.md) and Validation**: Tweak and optimize the strategy, then validate it to avoid [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md).

### Example: A Simple Moving Average Crossover Strategy

Below is an example of implementing a simple moving average crossover strategy using [Backtrader](../b/backtrader.md):

```python
[import](../i/import.md) [backtrader](../b/backtrader.md) as bt
[import](../i/import.md) datetime

# Create a Strategy
class SmaCross(bt.SignalStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        sma1, sma2 = bt.ind.SMA(period=10), bt.ind.SMA(period=30)
        crossover = bt.ind.CrossOver(sma1, sma2)
        self.signal_add(bt.SIGNAL_LONG, crossover)

# Init Cerebro
cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
cerebro.addstrategy(SmaCross)

# Data Feed
data = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceData(dataname='AAPL',
                                 fromdate=datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 1),
                                 todate=datetime.datetime(2020, 12, 31))
cerebro.adddata(data)

# Set Cash
cerebro.[broker](../b/broker.md).setcash(10000)

# Run and Plot
print('Starting Portfolio [Value](../v/value.md): %.2f' % cerebro.[broker](../b/broker.md).getvalue())
cerebro.run()
print('Ending Portfolio [Value](../v/value.md): %.2f' % cerebro.[broker](../b/broker.md).getvalue())
cerebro.plot()
```

In this example:
- We define a strategy (`SmaCross`) that enters a long position when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average.
- We initialize the `cerebro` engine and add our strategy.
- We add a data feed from [Yahoo Finance](../y/yahoo_finance.md) for Apple (AAPL) stock.
- We set an initial [capital](../c/capital.md) amount.
- We run the backtest and plot the results.

## Performance Metrics

Analyzing [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) is crucial for understanding how well a strategy might perform in live trading. Here are some commonly used metrics:

### 1. Net Profit

Net [profit](../p/profit.md) is the difference between total gains and total losses.

```python
total_cash = cerebro.[broker](../b/broker.md).getvalue()
initial_cash = 10000
net_profit = total_cash - initial_cash
print('Net [Profit](../p/profit.md): %.2f' % net_profit)
```

### 2. Return on Investment (ROI)

ROI measures the profitability of an investment compared to its initial cost.

```python
roi = (total_cash / initial_cash - 1) * 100
print('ROI: %.2f%%' % roi)
```

### 3. Sharpe Ratio

[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) assesses the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) of an investment.

```python
returns = [original-[value](../v/value.md) - new-[value](../v/value.md) for original-[value](../v/value.md), new-[value](../v/value.md) in zip(original_values, new_values)]
sharpe_ratio = np.mean(returns) / np.std(returns) * np.sqrt(252) # assuming daily returns
print('[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md): %.2f' % sharpe_ratio)
```

### 4. Maximum Drawdown

Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) measures the largest peak-to-[trough](../t/trough.md) decline in the portfolio.

```python
def max_drawdown(equity_curve):
    i = np.argmax(np.maximum.accumulate(equity_curve) - equity_curve)
    j = np.argmax(equity_curve[:i])
    [return](../r/return.md) (equity_curve[j] - equity_curve[i]) / equity_curve[j]

equity_curve = np.array([val.portfolio_value for val in cerebro.run()])
max_dd = max_drawdown(equity_curve)
print('Max [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md): %.2f%%' % (max_dd * 100))
```

## Common Pitfalls in Backtesting

While [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) can provide valuable insights, there are common pitfalls you should be aware of:

### 1. Look-Ahead Bias

This occurs when future data is used accidentally in your strategy. Ensuring that decisions are made only on data available up to that point in time is crucial.

### 2. Overfitting

[Overfitting](../o/overfitting.md) happens when a strategy is too closely tailored to historical data, leading to poor performance in live trading.

### 3. Survivorship Bias

[Survivorship bias](../s/survivorship_bias.md) happens when historical data only considers assets that have survived until the present, ignoring those that have failed.

### 4. Ignoring Slippage and Transaction Costs

Ignoring these can overestimate the performance of your strategy, as real-world trading involves deductions due to these factors.

## Advanced Topics

### Walk-Forward Analysis

Walk-forward analysis involves partitioning your data into training and testing sets in a way that mimics rolling forward in time. This technique helps in optimizing and validating your strategy.

### Reinforcement Learning

[Reinforcement learning](../r/reinforcement_learning.md) allows strategies to adapt dynamically by learning from their performance. Libraries like [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md) and [PyTorch](../p/pytorch.md) can be integrated with [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) frameworks to develop AI-driven [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

### Genetic Algorithms

[Genetic algorithms](../g/genetic_algorithms_in_trading.md) can help optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) by simulating the process of natural selection, iterating through potential solutions to find the most effective strategy parameters.

## Conclusion

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) is an indispensable tool in the arsenal of any algorithmic [trader](../t/trader.md). Python offers a variety of libraries and tools that simplify the process of developing, testing, and optimizing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). While [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) provides valuable insights, it is crucial to be aware of common pitfalls and limitations to make the most of this practice.

To explore further, consider diving into the documentation of libraries mentioned above and experiment with different strategies, data sources, and [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).
