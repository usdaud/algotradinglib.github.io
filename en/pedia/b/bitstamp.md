# Bitstamp

Bitstamp is one of the most established cryptocurrency exchanges globally, being in operation since 2011. Founded by Nejc Kodrič and Damijan Merlak, Bitstamp has aimed to provide a reliable and secure platform for buying and selling digital currencies like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), and others. The company is headquartered in Luxembourg and has offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Slovenia.

## History and Founding

Bitstamp was founded as a European-focused alternative to the then-dominant Mt.Gox [exchange](../e/exchange.md) following a series of scandals and reliability issues surrounding Mt.Gox. At its inception, Bitstamp sought to create a transparent and secure [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md) for digital currencies.

Initially, the company was founded in Slovenia, but it later moved its registration to the United Kingdom in 2013. Recognizing the need for a more favorable regulatory climate as well as better banking relationships, Bitstamp relocated to Luxembourg in 2016, acquiring a license to operate as a fully regulated [payment](../p/payment.md) institution.

## Regulatory Compliance

Bitstamp is known for its rigorous adherence to regulatory standards. The company was one of the first exchanges to [gain](../g/gain.md) licenses and adhere to anti-[money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) (AML) and know-your-[customer](../c/customer.md) (KYC) regulations. It has worked closely with financial regulators in different jurisdictions to ensure compliance:

- **Luxembourg**: Bitstamp holds a [payment](../p/payment.md) institution license, ensuring adherence to stringent financial regulations.
- **United States**: It is registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a [Money](../m/money.md) Services [Business](../b/business.md) (MSB).

The regulatory framework surrounding Bitstamp contributes significantly to its reputation as a safe and reliable [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for both retail and institutional investors.
