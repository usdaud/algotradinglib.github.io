# Binary Option

Binary [options](../o/options.md) are a type of option contract in which the [payout](../p/payout.md) depends entirely on the outcome of a yes/no proposition. Typically, this proposition [will](../w/will.md) be whether an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) be above or below a specified price at a specified time. Unlike traditional [options](../o/options.md), binary [options](../o/options.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) a fixed [payout](../p/payout.md) or nothing at all, which makes them also known as "all-or-nothing [options](../o/options.md)" or "digital [options](../o/options.md)."

## Definition of Binary Options

Binary [options](../o/options.md) are financial instruments that allow traders to speculate on the direction of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price within a predetermined timeframe. The key characteristic of binary [options](../o/options.md) is their simplicity: there are only two possible outcomes. Traders purchase a binary option contract, and the potential outcomes are:

1. **In-the-[money](../m/money.md):** If the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s prediction is correct (e.g., the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price is above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at the expiry time), they receive a fixed, predetermined [payout](../p/payout.md).
2. **Out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md):** If the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s prediction is incorrect, they lose the [money](../m/money.md) they invested in the option.

This simplicity and the prospect of high returns have made binary [options](../o/options.md) popular among retail traders. However, they are also controversial due to their high-[risk](../r/risk.md) nature and association with fraudulent practices.

## How Binary Options Trade

Trading binary [options](../o/options.md) involves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) steps and requires a clear understanding of the process and associated risks. Here is a detailed guide on how binary [options](../o/options.md) are traded:

### 1. **Choosing a Broker**

To [trade](../t/trade.md) binary [options](../o/options.md), one must first select a reliable and regulated [broker](../b/broker.md). This is crucial because the binary [options](../o/options.md) [market](../m/market.md) has been plagued by scammers and fraudulent platforms. Some of the well-known binary [options](../o/options.md) brokers include:

- IQ Option - Binary.com - Olymp [Trade](../t/trade.md) (

### 2. **Selecting an Asset**

Binary [options](../o/options.md) can be traded on a variety of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, indices, and [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs (Forex). Traders can choose the [asset](../a/asset.md) they are most comfortable with or believe they can predict accurately.

### 3. **Determining the Expiry Time**

Binary [options](../o/options.md) have various expiry times ranging from as short as 60 seconds to several months. The expiry time is an essential component as it determines when the outcome of the [trade](../t/trade.md) [will](../w/will.md) be evaluated.

### 4. **Setting the Strike Price**

The [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is the level at which the [trader](../t/trader.md) predicts whether the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price [will](../w/will.md) be above or below at the expiry time. Some platforms set the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) automatically based on the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s current price, while others allow traders to choose it.

### 5. **Placing the Trade**

To place a [trade](../t/trade.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) must decide the direction in which they believe the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price [will](../w/will.md) move:

- **[Call Option](../c/call_option.md) (Up):** The [trader](../t/trader.md) believes the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price [will](../w/will.md) be above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiry.
- **[Put Option](../p/put.md) (Down):** The [trader](../t/trader.md) believes the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price [will](../w/will.md) be below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiry.

### 6. **Risk Management**

Given the high-[risk](../r/risk.md) nature of binary [options](../o/options.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial. Traders should only [risk](../r/risk.md) [money](../m/money.md) they can afford to lose and consider using tools like [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) and [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) to manage exposure.

### 7. **Monitoring and Closing the Trade**

Once the [trade](../t/trade.md) is placed, the [trader](../t/trader.md) monitors the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price movement until the expiry time. Some brokers [offer](../o/offer.md) the option to close the [trade](../t/trade.md) before the expiry to [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md) or minimize losses, although this may come with additional costs or reduced payouts.

## Example of a Binary Option Trade

Let's illustrate a binary option [trade](../t/trade.md) with an example involving a popular [asset](../a/asset.md) such as gold:

1. **Choosing the [Broker](../b/broker.md):** The [trader](../t/trader.md) uses IQ Option to place their [trade](../t/trade.md).

2. **Selecting the [Asset](../a/asset.md):** The [trader](../t/trader.md) decides to [trade](../t/trade.md) binary [options](../o/options.md) on the price of gold.

3. **Determining the Expiry Time:** The [trader](../t/trader.md) selects an expiry time of one hour.

4. **Setting the [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md):** The current price of gold is $1,750 per ounce. The [broker](../b/broker.md) sets the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at $1,750.

5. **Placing the [Trade](../t/trade.md):** The [trader](../t/trader.md) predicts that the price of gold [will](../w/will.md) be higher than $1,750 at the expiry time. They purchase a [call option](../c/call_option.md) for $100.

6. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** The [trader](../t/trader.md) decides to [risk](../r/risk.md) no more than 5% of their total [capital](../c/capital.md) on this single [trade](../t/trade.md).

7. **Monitoring and Closing the [Trade](../t/trade.md):** After one hour, the price of gold is $1,755 per ounce, which is above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $1,750. Because the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s prediction was correct (the price increased), they are "in-the-[money](../m/money.md)."

### Calculation of Payout and Return

- **Investment Amount:** $100
- **[Payout Ratio](../p/payout_ratio.md) Offered by [Broker](../b/broker.md):** 80%

If the [trader](../t/trader.md) wins:
- **[Payout](../p/payout.md):** $100 (investment amount) + $80 (80% [payout](../p/payout.md)) = $180

If the [trader](../t/trader.md) loses:
- **Loss:** $100 (the investment amount)

In this case, the [trader](../t/trader.md) wins the binary option and receives a total [payout](../p/payout.md) of $180, yielding an $80 [profit](../p/profit.md) on their $100 investment.

## Regulatory and Ethical Considerations

The binary [options](../o/options.md) [market](../m/market.md) has attracted significant regulatory and ethical scrutiny due to incidents of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and manipulation. Regulatory authorities across the world have taken steps to curb malpractices and protect retail traders.

### Major Regulatory Actions

1. **United States:**
 - The [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC) and Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) regulate binary [options](../o/options.md) in the U.S.
 - They have taken legal action against fraudulent brokers and platform operators.

3. **Australia:**
 - The Australian Securities and Investments [Commission](../c/commission.md) (ASIC) has also regulated binary [options](../o/options.md) and warned investors about the high risks.

### Ethical Concerns

The ethical concerns surrounding binary [options](../o/options.md) primarily stem from:

- **High [Risk](../r/risk.md):** The all-or-nothing nature of binary [options](../o/options.md) makes them extremely high-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments.
- **Misleading Advertising:** Some brokers falsely advertise high returns while downplaying risks.
- **[Conflict of Interest](../c/conflict_of_interest.md):** Since many brokers act as [market](../m/market.md) makers, they [profit](../p/profit.md) from the traders' losses, leading to potential conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md).
- **Scams and [Fraud](../f/fraud.md):** Numerous fraudulent platforms have scammed traders out of their investments, damaging the [market](../m/market.md)'s reputation.

## Conclusion

Binary [options](../o/options.md) present a unique way for traders to speculate on the price movements of various assets with potential high returns. However, their simplicity belies the significant risks they carry. Traders must [exercise](../e/exercise.md) caution, conduct thorough research, and choose reputable and regulated brokers to mitigate risks. Moreover, the ethical and regulatory landscape of binary [options](../o/options.md) continues to evolve, aiming to protect traders and maintain [market](../m/market.md) integrity.
