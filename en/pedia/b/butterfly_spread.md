# Butterfly Spread

A butterfly spread is a [neutral](../n/neutral.md) [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that involves the simultaneous purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [options](../o/options.md) with different strike prices. This strategy is designed to generate a [profit](../p/profit.md) when the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) remains within a certain [range](../r/range.md), and it is popular among traders who expect minimal price movement. The butterfly spread can be implemented using either calls or puts and can be further divided into different variations like [long butterfly spread](../l/long_butterfly_spread.md) and [short butterfly spread](../s/short_butterfly_spread.md).

## Components of a Butterfly Spread

A standard butterfly spread consists of three legs:
1. Buying one in-the-[money](../m/money.md) (ITM) option.
2. Selling two at-the-[money](../m/money.md) (ATM) [options](../o/options.md).
3. Buying one out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) (OTM) option.

### Example

Consider a stock currently trading at $100. A [trader](../t/trader.md) could set up a butterfly spread as follows:
- Buy 1 call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $95 (ITM)
- Sell 2 calls with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100 (ATM)
- Buy 1 call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $105 (OTM)

The result is a position where the [trader](../t/trader.md) profits the most if the stock closes at the ATM [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiration. Profits diminish as the stock price moves away from the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

## Types of Butterfly Spreads

### Long Butterfly Spread

A [long butterfly spread](../l/long_butterfly_spread.md) is set up by purchasing a lower strike option, selling two middle strike [options](../o/options.md), and purchasing a higher strike option. This strategy results in a net [debit](../d/debit.md) initially paid out, but offers a high reward-to-[risk](../r/risk.md) ratio if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is around the middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiration.

### Short Butterfly Spread

In contrast, a [short butterfly spread](../s/short_butterfly_spread.md) involves selling the lower and higher strike [options](../o/options.md) and purchasing twice the middle strike [options](../o/options.md). This results in a net [credit](../c/credit.md) received initially, but the [risk](../r/risk.md) can be significant if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price moves significantly.

## Advantages of Butterfly Spreads

1. **Limited [Risk](../r/risk.md):** The maximum loss is limited to the net [debit](../d/debit.md) paid to establish the position.
2. **Potential for High Reward:** Given the low cost of entry, the strategy can [offer](../o/offer.md) a high reward-to-[risk](../r/risk.md) ratio.
3. **[Neutral](../n/neutral.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Strategy:** Ideal for markets where sideways movement or minimal price change is anticipated.
4. **Flexibility:** Can be applied to various [underlying](../u/underlying.md) financial instruments including [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, and indices.

## Disadvantages of Butterfly Spreads

1. **Limited [Profit](../p/profit.md) [Range](../r/range.md):** The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) is only realized if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is at the middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiration.
2. **[Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md):** Can work against the position if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price doesn't move as expected.
3. **Complexity:** Requires precise timing and selection of strike prices, which may be complicated for beginner traders.

## Advanced Strategies

### Broken-Wing Butterfly

A broken-wing butterfly spread is a variation in which the width between the strike prices is not equal. This adaptation creates the potential for higher rewards or better control of [risk](../r/risk.md). For instance:
- Buy 1 call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $90
- Sell 2 calls with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100
- Buy 1 call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $110

This can enhance the profitability if properly executed under the right [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Iron Butterfly Spread

An [iron butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) involves both calls and puts. It is created by selling an at-the-[money](../m/money.md) [straddle](../s/straddle.md) (selling an ATM call and an ATM put) and buying an out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) [strangle](../s/strangle.md). The [iron butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) has limited loss and [profit](../p/profit.md) potential and mirrors a standard butterfly but is less [capital](../c/capital.md) intensive.

## Conclusion

Butterfly spread is a powerful [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) apt for traders anticipating a [neutral](../n/neutral.md) [market](../m/market.md). While the strategy capably limits [risk](../r/risk.md) and can [offer](../o/offer.md) a rewarding payoff if executed meticulously, it requires a deep understanding of the [market](../m/market.md), precise timing, and choice of strike prices. By leveraging the resources and tools available at reputable trading platforms, traders can enhance their strategies and optimize their potential returns.
