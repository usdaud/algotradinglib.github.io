# Broker

A broker, in the context of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), is an individual or [firm](../f/firm.md) that acts as an intermediary between an [investor](../i/investor.md) and a securities [exchange](../e/exchange.md). A broker can serve a variety of functions, including facilitating the purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of assets, [offering](../o/offering.md) research and analytical tools, providing financial advice, and executing trades on behalf of clients. Brokers can serve retail clients (individuals) and institutional clients (organizations such as mutual funds, pension funds, and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds). This topic spans brokerage firms, the services they [offer](../o/offer.md), regulatory aspects, and their role in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (or algo-trading).

## Types of Brokers

Brokers can be classified based on the services they provide:

### Full-Service Brokers

These brokers [offer](../o/offer.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of services, including financial consultation, [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), tax advice, and research. Clients generally pay a [premium](../p/premium.md) for these services. Examples include:

- **[Merrill Lynch](../m/merrill_lynch.md)**: Merrill Lynch
- **Morgan Stanley**: Morgan Stanley
- **Goldman Sachs**: Goldman Sachs

### Discount Brokers

[Discount](../d/discount.md) brokers provide only the basic services without much advisory services. They usually charge lower fees than full-service brokers. Examples include:

- **[Charles Schwab](../c/charles_schwab.md)**: Charles Schwab
- **[Fidelity Investments](../f/fidelity_investments.md)**: Fidelity Investments
- **Charles Schwab** (includes former TD Ameritrade following September 2023 acquisition): Charles Schwab

### Online Brokers

These brokers operate exclusively over the internet and [offer](../o/offer.md) an online platform for clients to [trade](../t/trade.md) independently. Their services are similar to [discount](../d/discount.md) brokers, but they often include more tools and resources for self-directed investors. Examples include:

- **[Robinhood](../r/robinhood.md)**: Robinhood
- **[E*TRADE](../e/e_trade.md)**: E*TRADE
- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md)**: Interactive Brokers

## Regulatory Aspects

Brokers are subject to various regulations depending on the jurisdiction in which they operate. These regulations ensure that brokers operate fairly and transparently. Key regulatory bodies include:

- **U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC)**: Oversees all securities brokers in the United States.
- **Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA)**: Regulates brokerage firms and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) markets in the U.S.
- **[Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC)**: Regulates brokers dealing with [commodity futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) in the U.S.
- **European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)**: Regulates the securities markets in the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md).

## Role of Brokers in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or 'algo-trading,' involves using computer algorithms to [trade](../t/trade.md) financial securities automatically. Brokers play a significant role in facilitating [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). Here’s how:

### Providing API Access

Many brokers provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow traders to connect their algorithms directly to the broker’s [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md). Through these APIs, algorithms can send [trade](../t/trade.md) orders directly to the [market](../m/market.md). Examples include:

- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) API**: Interactive Brokers API
- **Charles Schwab API** (includes former TD Ameritrade API following September 2023 acquisition): Charles Schwab for Developers
- **[Alpaca](../a/alpaca.md) API**: Alpaca API

### Execution Algorithms

Brokers often [offer](../o/offer.md) standard [execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md) designed to minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact, reduce [trading costs](../t/trading_costs.md), and improve [execution](../e/execution.md) quality. These algorithms might include:

- **VWAP ([Volume](../v/volume.md) [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price)**: Aims to execute orders at the average price [weighted](../w/weighted.md) by the [volume](../v/volume.md) over a specific period.
- **TWAP (Time [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price)**: Executes orders evenly over a specified time period.
- **Iceberg Orders**: Displays only a small portion of the total [order](../o/order.md) size to avoid revealing large [order](../o/order.md) sizes to the [market](../m/market.md).

### Smart Order Routing

[Smart Order Routing](../s/smart_order_routing.md) (SOR) is a technology that brokers use to ensure orders are sent to the most appropriate [market](../m/market.md) or trading venue. SOR is crucial in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) as it optimizes the [execution](../e/execution.md) quality by considering [multiple](../m/multiple.md) factors such as [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), speed, and price.

### Market Data

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) relies heavily on accurate and [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md). Brokers provide high-quality [market](../m/market.md) data feeds that include:

- **Level I Data**: Best [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices, last [trade](../t/trade.md) price, and [volume](../v/volume.md).
- **Level II Data**: [Market depth](../m/market_depth.md), including additional [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices beyond the best quotes.
- **Historical Data**: Essential for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

## Brokerage Fees

Brokers charge fees and commissions for their services, which can significantly impact an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s returns. Here are the common types of fees:

### Commission Fees

A [fee](../f/fee.md) per [trade](../t/trade.md) [transaction](../t/transaction.md), either as a flat [fee](../f/fee.md) or a percentage of the [trade](../t/trade.md)’s [value](../v/value.md).

### Spread

The difference between the buy (ask) and sell ([bid](../b/bid.md)) prices. Some brokers use [spreads](../s/spreads.md) instead of charging commissions, particularly in forex trading.

### Account Maintenance Fees

Some brokers charge a monthly or annual [fee](../f/fee.md) to maintain the account.

### Inactivity Fees

A [fee](../f/fee.md) levied if the account does not meet a minimum level of trading activity.

### Data Fees

Some brokers charge for access to [premium](../p/premium.md) [market](../m/market.md) data.

## Brokerage Accounts

To [trade](../t/trade.md) through a broker, investors must [open](../o/open.md) a [brokerage account](../b/brokerage_account.md). Brokerage accounts can be of several types:

### Cash Accounts

Investors pay the full amount for securities purchased.

### Margin Accounts

Investors borrow funds from the broker to purchase securities, using the securities in the account as [collateral](../c/collateral.md).

### Retirement Accounts

[Tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) accounts like Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) in the U.S.

### Custodial Accounts

Accounts managed on behalf of minors.

## Technological Innovations

Brokers have continuously innovated to provide better services and efficiencies in trading. Some notable technological trends include:

### Robo-Advisors

Automated platforms that provide algorithm-driven [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) services with little to no human supervision.

### Mobile Trading Apps

Brokers increasingly [offer](../o/offer.md) mobile apps to facilitate trading from anywhere, providing instant access to account management, research, and live [market](../m/market.md) data.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)

AI and ML are increasingly used to develop advanced [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), [fraud](../f/fraud.md) detection systems, and personalized financial advice.

## Conclusion

Brokers play a pivotal role in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), acting as intermediaries that facilitate the buying and selling of securities. They provide valuable services, ranging from executing trades and [offering](../o/offering.md) financial advice to providing [market](../m/market.md) data and technological tools for trading. In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), brokers are instrumental in providing the necessary [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), including APIs, [execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md), and [smart order routing](../s/smart_order_routing.md). As the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) continue to evolve with technological advancements, the role of brokers is set to become even more crucial in ensuring efficient and effective [market](../m/market.md) operations.
