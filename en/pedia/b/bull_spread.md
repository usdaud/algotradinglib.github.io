# Bull Spread

A [Bull](../b/bull.md) Spread, also known as a Bullish Spread, is an [options](../o/options.md) strategy used by traders who anticipate a moderate rise in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This strategy can be implemented with either call [options](../o/options.md) or [put options](../p/put_options.md), depending on the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s preference and [market](../m/market.md) conditions. [Bull](../b/bull.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) are popular because they limit both potential profits and losses, making them an attractive choice for conservative investors.

## Types of Bull Spreads

There are primarily two types of [bull](../b/bull.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md):

1. **[Bull Call Spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md)**
2. **[Bull Put Spread](../b/bull_put_spread.md)**

### Bull Call Spread
A [Bull Call Spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md) involves buying a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) while simultaneously selling another [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). Both [options](../o/options.md) have the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This strategy is constructed to [profit](../p/profit.md) from a moderate rise in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

**Example:**

Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) is bullish on a stock that is currently trading at $50. They could implement a [bull call spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md) by:

- Buying a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $50 for $5 per share (Option A)
- Selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $55 for $2 per share (Option B)

The total cost (or [premium](../p/premium.md)) for this spread is $3 per share ($5 - $2).

**Outcome Scenarios:**

1. **Stock price at expiry is below $50:**
 - Both [options](../o/options.md) expire worthless.
 - Loss = [Premium](../p/premium.md) paid = $3 per share.

2. **Stock price at expiry is between $50 and $55:**
 - Option A is in the [money](../m/money.md).
 - Option B is out of the [money](../m/money.md) or [at the money](../a/at_the_money.md).
 - [Profit](../p/profit.md) = (Stock price at expiry - $50) - $3.

3. **Stock price at expiry is above $55:**
 - Both [options](../o/options.md) are in the [money](../m/money.md).
 - Maximum [Profit](../p/profit.md) = ($55 - $50) - $3 = $2 per share.

### Bull Put Spread
A [Bull Put Spread](../b/bull_put_spread.md) involves selling a [put option](../p/put.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) while simultaneously buying another [put option](../p/put.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). Both [options](../o/options.md) have the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This strategy aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from a moderate rise in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) while limiting potential losses.

**Example:**

Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) is bullish on a stock that is currently trading at $50. They could implement a [bull put spread](../b/bull_put_spread.md) by:

- Selling a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $50 for $5 per share (Option C)
- Buying a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $45 for $2 per share (Option D)

The total net [credit](../c/credit.md) for this spread is $3 per share ($5 - $2).

**Outcome Scenarios:**

1. **Stock price at expiry is below $45:**
 - Both [options](../o/options.md) are in the [money](../m/money.md).
 - Loss = ($50 - $45) - $3 = $2 per share.

2. **Stock price at expiry is between $45 and $50:**
 - Option C is in the [money](../m/money.md) or [at the money](../a/at_the_money.md).
 - Option D is out of the [money](../m/money.md).
 - [Profit](../p/profit.md) = Net [credit](../c/credit.md) received ($3) - (Stock price at expiry - $45).

3. **Stock price at expiry is above $50:**
 - Both [options](../o/options.md) expire worthless.
 - Maximum [Profit](../p/profit.md) = Net [credit](../c/credit.md) received = $3 per share.

## Advantages of Bull Spread

- **Limited [Risk](../r/risk.md):** Both [bull](../b/bull.md) call and [bull](../b/bull.md) put [spreads](../s/spreads.md) have a clearly defined [risk](../r/risk.md), limited to the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid or received.
- **Reduced Cost:** Compared to buying a single call or [put option](../p/put.md), [bull](../b/bull.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) typically involve a lower [net premium](../n/net_premium.md).

## Disadvantages of Bull Spread

- **Limited [Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential:** While the [risk](../r/risk.md) is limited, the [profit](../p/profit.md) potential is also capped.
- **Requires Moderate Bullish Movement:** [Bull](../b/bull.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) are not suitable for very bullish scenarios where the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is expected to rise significantly.

## When to Use Bull Spread

- **[Neutral](../n/neutral.md) to Moderately Bullish Outlook:** Ideal when the [trader](../t/trader.md) expects a modest rise in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price.
- **Controlled [Risk](../r/risk.md) Environment:** Suitable in situations where [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial.

## Real-World Application

Many trading platforms, including brokerages like TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md) (link) and [interactive brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) (link), provide tools and educational resources to help investors implement [bull](../b/bull.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) effectively. Traders can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) these resources to set up, monitor, and adjust their [bull](../b/bull.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) in real-time, ensuring that they align with the [market](../m/market.md) movements and their financial goals.
