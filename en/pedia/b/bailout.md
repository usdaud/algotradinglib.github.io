# Bailout

## Introduction
A "bailout" refers to the financial support provided by the government or another institution to a failing [business](../b/business.md). The term became particularly prevalent during the financial crises of the 21st century, most notably the 2008 Global [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). Bailouts are designed to prevent the collapse of an entity by providing it the necessary [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) or [capital](../c/capital.md). This financial assistance can come in various forms, such as loans, grants, stock purchases, or other means to stabilize the entity.

## Types of Bailouts
Bailouts can be classified into several types, depending on the nature and form of support provided:

### Government Bailouts
Government bailouts are the most common form, where a governmental entity provides financial assistance to a failing [business](../b/business.md) or sector. The U.S. government, for example, provided several large-scale bailouts during the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) to major banks and auto manufacturers.

### Private Sector Bailouts
These involve financial assistance from private corporations or investors. In some cases, [industry](../i/industry.md) giants or competitors step in to rescue a failing company within the same sector, to prevent a domino effect that could damage the entire [industry](../i/industry.md).

### Mutual Assistance Bailouts
In certain sectors, such as banking, institutions may have agreements to support each other during times of [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md). This mutual assistance helps maintain stability within the [industry](../i/industry.md) and ensures the collective health of the participating entities.

## Mechanisms of Bailouts
Bailouts can involve one or more of the following mechanisms:

### Loans
Loans are a common bailout mechanism, where the entity provides funds that must be repaid over time. These may come with favorable terms, such as lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates or longer [repayment](../r/repayment.md) periods.

### Equity Infusions
In some cases, the bailout comes in the form of purchasing [equity](../e/equity.md) in the failing enterprise. This can result in partial ownership of the [business](../b/business.md) by the rescuing entity, often the government.

### Asset Purchases
A bailout can also involve the purchase of distressed assets from the failing company. This removes these risky assets from the company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), providing it with immediate [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Guarantees
Government guarantees can help instill confidence in investors and other stakeholders. By guaranteeing certain debts or [obligations](../o/obligation.md), the government can help stabilize the failing entity's financial situation.

## Historical Examples
Several notable bailouts have occurred throughout history, and each provides a different perspective on the use and effects of this financial tool.

### 2008 Global Financial Crisis
One of the most well-known instances of government bailouts occurred during the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). Key players included:

- **American International Group (AIG)**: The U.S. government stepped in with an $85 billion [loan](../l/loan.md) to prevent AIG from collapsing.
- **Automakers**: The U.S. government provided $80 billion to support General Motors and Chrysler.
- **Major Banks**: Banks like Citigroup and [Bank](../b/bank.md) of America received substantial funds as part of the Troubled [Asset](../a/asset.md) Relief Program (TARP).

### 1997 Asian Financial Crisis
Countries like South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand received IMF bailouts to stabilize their economies following massive [capital](../c/capital.md) flight and [currency](../c/currency.md) [devaluation](../d/devaluation.md).

### Eurozone Debt Crisis
Countries such as Greece, Spain, and Ireland received bailouts from the International Monetary [Fund](../f/fund.md) (IMF) and the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) (EU). These countries faced severe [debt](../d/debt.md) crises and required substantial financial support to stabilize their economies.

## Advantages of Bailouts
### Preventing Economic Collapse
Bailouts can prevent the collapse of critical industries, preserving jobs and stabilizing the [economy](../e/economy.md). Without these interventions, the failure of major entities can lead to widespread economic instability.

### Confidence and Stability
Providing financial support to struggling entities helps instill confidence in the [market](../m/market.md). Stakeholders, including investors and customers, are more likely to continue their relationships with the bailed-out entity, knowing it has the necessary backing.

### Systemic Risk Mitigation
In sectors like banking, the failure of one institution can lead to [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md), where the failure [spreads](../s/spreads.md) to other institutions. Bailouts help to prevent this domino effect, ensuring the overall stability of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

## Criticisms of Bailouts
Despite their benefits, bailouts are not without criticism:

### Moral Hazard
One of the most common criticisms of bailouts is the concept of [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md). Entities that know they [will](../w/will.md) be bailed out in times of trouble may take undue risks, knowing they won't face the full consequences of their actions.

### Inequity
Bailouts often favor large corporations or banks, leaving small businesses and individual taxpayers without similar support. This perceived inequity can lead to public outcry and dissatisfaction.

### Long-Term Dependencies
Frequent bailouts can lead to long-term dependencies, where entities rely on government support rather than implementing sustainable [business](../b/business.md) practices and financial controls.

### Financial Burden on Taxpayers
Government bailouts typically involve [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) [money](../m/money.md), increasing the national [debt](../d/debt.md) and potentially leading to higher [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or reduced public expenditure in other areas.

## Case Study: 2008 Financial Crisis Bailouts
### Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)
The Troubled [Asset](../a/asset.md) Relief Program (TARP) was established by the U.S. government in 2008 to stabilize the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). Through TARP, the Treasury purchased troubled assets and [equity](../e/equity.md) from financial institutions, providing them with the necessary [capital](../c/capital.md) to maintain operations. TARP was a pivotal element in preventing the broader collapse of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

### American International Group (AIG)
AIG was on the brink of collapse in 2008, primarily due to its exposure to [subprime mortgage](../s/subprime_mortgage.md)-backed securities. The U.S. government intervened with an $85 billion [loan](../l/loan.md), which later expanded to $182 billion in total. This bailout was crucial in preventing a catastrophic fallout in the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

### Auto Industry
The bailout of the American auto [industry](../i/industry.md) was another significant intervention during the 2008 crisis. General Motors and Chrysler received a combined $80 billion in loans and [equity](../e/equity.md) investments. This support helped the companies restructure, ultimately leading to a revival of the American auto [industry](../i/industry.md).

## Conclusion
Bailouts play a critical role in stabilizing economies during periods of [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md). While they [offer](../o/offer.md) immediate benefits by preventing the collapse of major institutions and instilling [market](../m/market.md) confidence, they also come with significant drawbacks such as promoting [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md) and creating financial burdens on taxpayers. The balance between these benefits and drawbacks continues to be a subject of ongoing debate among economists, policymakers, and the public. Understanding the complex dynamics of bailouts is essential in establishing measures that protect the [economy](../e/economy.md) while encouraging sustainable [business](../b/business.md) practices and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).
