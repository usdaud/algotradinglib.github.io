# Quantitative Momentum

### Definition and Overview

Quantitative [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) is an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) that seeks to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the persistence of price trends in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). Unlike traditional [momentum investing](../m/momentum_investing.md), which often involves a qualitative assessment of [market](../m/market.md) trends and company fundamentals, Quantitative [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) relies heavily on statistical and mathematical techniques to identify high-[momentum](../m/momentum.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). By systematically analyzing past price movements and other financial data, this strategy aims to predict future price movements and generate significant returns while managing [risk](../r/risk.md). 

### Core Principles

The core principles of Quantitative [Momentum investing](../m/momentum_investing.md) involve systematic data analysis, [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md), and disciplined [execution](../e/execution.md). The following are the essential principles that underpin this approach:

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The strategy is grounded in extensive empirical research, suggesting that [stocks](../s/stock.md) that have performed well in the past [will](../w/will.md) continue to [outperform](../o/outperform.md). 

2. **[Factor Models](../f/factor_models.md)**: Quantitative [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) often utilizes [factor models](../f/factor_models.md), such as the Fama-French three-[factor](../f/factor.md) model, incorporating factors like size, [value](../v/value.md), and [momentum](../m/momentum.md) to construct portfolios.

3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Effective [risk control](../r/risk_control.md) mechanisms, such as [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) and [diversification](../d/diversification.md), are crucial to manage potential drawdowns.

4. **Automation and Algorithms**: Given the quantitative nature, [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) and algorithms are deployed to execute trades efficiently.

### Data and Metrics

Quantitative [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) relies on various data types and metrics:

- **Price Data**: Historical price movements are the primary data source, with metrics like [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) and moving averages being key indicators.

- **[Volume](../v/volume.md) Data**: Trading [volume](../v/volume.md) helps validate the strength of a price [trend](../t/trend.md).

- **Fundamental Data**: Although less emphasized, basic financial metrics such as [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth may be incorporated.

### Popular Metrics and Indicators

Some standard indicators and metrics in Quantitative [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) include:

- **12-Month Rolling [Momentum](../m/momentum.md)**: The [total return](../t/total_return.md) of a stock over the past 12 months, excluding the most recent month.
  
- **Moving Averages**: Particularly the 50-day and 200-day moving averages to assess medium- and long-term trends.

- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI)**: A [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) measuring the speed and change of price movements.
  
- **[Volume](../v/volume.md) Strength**: Analyzing [volume](../v/volume.md) trends to confirm price movements.

### Model Construction and Backtesting

Constructing a Quantitative [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) model involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical price, [volume](../v/volume.md), and basic fundamental data.

2. **Screening**: Filter the stock universe to identify candidates based on [momentum](../m/momentum.md) criteria.

3. **Ranking**: Rank the filtered [stocks](../s/stock.md) according to their [momentum](../m/momentum.md) metrics.

4. **Portfolio Construction**: Select the top-ranked [stocks](../s/stock.md) while ensuring proper [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

5. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Test the strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance and refine parameters.

### Implementation

Implementing a Quantitative [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategy involves:

1. **Algorithm Development**: Writing algorithms to automate data processing, stock screening, and [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md).

2. **[Trade](../t/trade.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Utilizing advanced trading platforms and brokers that support automated trading.

3. **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Continuously monitor the strategy's performance and make adjustments as necessary.
