# Quick Trading Techniques

Quick trading techniques, often referred to as [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md), entail executing a high [volume](../v/volume.md) of trades within short periods. The [duration](../d/duration.md) can [range](../r/range.md) from a few seconds to several days. These techniques require in-depth [market](../m/market.md) knowledge, the right tools, and an understanding of various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to succeed. Here, we explore a variety of quick trading techniques in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (algo-trading) that traders and financial institutions use extensively.

## Market Orders and Limit Orders

### Market Orders
[Market](../m/market.md) orders are executed immediately at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). This type of [order](../o/order.md) guarantees [execution](../e/execution.md) but does not guarantee the price due to the possibility of [slippage](../s/slippage.md), especially in a highly volatile [market](../m/market.md).

### Limit Orders
Limit orders are set to execute at or better than a specified price. This means the [trade](../t/trade.md) [will](../w/will.md) only be executed if the [market price](../m/market_price.md) reaches the predetermined mark or better. Limit orders provide more control over the price at which the [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed.

## Scalping

### Definition
[Scalping](../s/scalping.md) is one of the most popular quick trading techniques. It involves taking advantage of small price [gaps](../g/gap.md) created by [order](../o/order.md) flows or [spreads](../s/spreads.md). Scalpers try to "scalp" numerous small profits throughout the day rather than focus on one major win.

### Methodology
1. **[Multiple](../m/multiple.md) Trades**: Scalpers can conduct hundreds of trades in a day.
2. **Quick Entry and Exit**: Trades are usually closed within minutes or even seconds.
3. **[Technical Indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md)**: Scalpers rely heavily on [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and indicators such as moving averages and [volume](../v/volume.md) charts.
   
### Tools
Professional scalpers use advanced trading tools that include fast [execution](../e/execution.md) platforms and direct [market](../m/market.md) access (DMA). These tools ensure that orders are executed as quickly as possible.

## Day Trading

### Definition
[Day trading](../d/day_trading.md) involves buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day, meaning that all positions are closed before the [market](../m/market.md) closes for the day.

### Methodology
1. **[Pre-Market](../p/pre-market.md) Preparation**: Traders prepare by evaluating [market](../m/market.md)-moving news and overnight [price action](../p/price_action.md).
2. **Strategies**: Common [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) strategies include [trend following](../t/trend_following.md), counter-[trend trading](../t/trend_trading.md), [breakout trading](../b/breakout_trading.md), and [momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md).
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Day traders typically employ strict [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies such as [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to mitigate losses.

### Tools
Day traders rely on real-time data feeds, advanced charting tools, and [execution](../e/execution.md) platforms that [offer](../o/offer.md) quick [order](../o/order.md) placement and high-speed trading capabilities.

## High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

### Definition
High-Frequency Trading is a form of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) that involves executing a large number of orders at extremely high speeds. The aim is to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on very short-lived [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies.

### Methodology
1. **Algorithms**: HFT strategies are implemented through complex algorithms that can identify [market](../m/market.md) trends and execute trades in milliseconds.
2. **Co-Location**: To further minimize latency, HFT firms often place their trading servers physically close to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) servers.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Making**: Many HFT firms engage in [market](../m/market.md) making, quoting both buy and sell prices to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md).

### Tools
HFT requires state-of-the-art technology, including powerful servers, high-speed internet connections, and sophisticated algorithms. Firms like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial are well-known HFT providers. Citadel Securities' website can be visited at [Citadel Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/).

## Swing Trading

### Definition
[Swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) involves holding positions for several days to weeks to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on expected upward or downward [market](../m/market.md) shifts or "swings."

### Methodology
1. **[Chart Patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md)**: Swing traders commonly use [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md) and [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to identify potential price movements.
2. **[Risk/Reward Ratio](../r/risk_reward_ratio.md)**: The strategy often involves evaluating the [risk/reward ratio](../r/risk_reward_ratio.md) before entering a [trade](../t/trade.md).
3. **Combining Analyses**: Some traders combine [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) with [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to make more informed decisions.

### Tools
Swing traders use charting software with comprehensive tools for [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). Platforms like [TradingView](../t/tradingview.md) are popular among swing traders for their [robust](../r/robust.md) charting capabilities and community support.

## News-Based Trading

### Definition
News-based trading, also known as [event-driven trading](../e/event-driven_trading.md), involves making [trade](../t/trade.md) decisions based on the release of significant news or data. This could include [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md), or unexpected news.

### Methodology
1. **News Feeds**: Traders use real-time news feeds and economic calendars to stay updated.
2. **Algorithmic Responses**: Often, algorithms are set to trigger trades based on the sentiment and impact of news.
3. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Exploitation**: The technique aims to exploit the initial surge in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) following major news announcements.

### Tools
Platforms such as [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) Terminal and [Reuters](../r/reuters.md) Eikon provide comprehensive news feeds and economic data, enabling traders to stay ahead of the curve.

## Momentum Trading

### Definition
[Momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md) involves buying or selling an [asset](../a/asset.md) when it's demonstrating strong price movement in a particular direction.

### Methodology
1. **[Technical Indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md)**: Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD), [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI), and [volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) are widely used.
2. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Confirmation**: [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) traders look for confirmation of trends before entering trades.
3. **Position Scaling**: Positions may be scaled in and out based on the strength of the [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Tools
Traders utilize platforms capable of high-speed [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) and advanced charting for [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). Brokerages like [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) tools essential for [momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md).

## Arbitrage

### Definition
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between different markets or instruments. The goal is to buy low in one [market](../m/market.md) and sell high in another almost simultaneously.

### Methodology
1. **Price Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of price discrepancies is essential.
2. **[Algorithmic Execution](../a/algorithmic_execution.md)**: Algorithms are often used to identify and execute [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities in real-time.
3. **Low Latency**: The speed of [execution](../e/execution.md) is crucial to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on fleeting pricing inefficiencies.

### Tools
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) traders need direct [market](../m/market.md) access, high-speed trading software, and low-latency connections. Firms like Jane Street specialize in [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) trading and provide insights on their website [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/).
