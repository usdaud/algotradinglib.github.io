# QuantLib

## Overview
QuantLib is an [open](../o/open.md)-source library for [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md), designed to provide comprehensive tools for modeling, trading, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) in real-life. Developed by a global community of contributors, QuantLib offers a wide [range](../r/range.md) of functionalities for pricing [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), managing portfolios, and performing complex financial calculations.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## Features

4. **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Advanced [Monte Carlo simulation](../m/monte_carlo_simulation.md) capabilities for option pricing and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).
5. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Tools for calculating [risk metrics](../r/risk_metrics.md) such as [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR) and [Greeks](../g/greeks.md).
6. **[Market](../m/market.md) Models**: Support for [market](../m/market.md) models including the LIBOR [Market](../m/market.md) Model (LMM).
7. **[Optimization](../o/optimization.md) Tools**: [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) algorithms for calibrating models and optimizing portfolios.
8. **Financial Calculators**: A [range](../r/range.md) of financial calculators for performing day count conventions, [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) calculations, and more.
9. **Extensible Framework**: Modular and extensible design allowing users to add custom instruments and models.
10. **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on [multiple](../m/multiple.md) platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
