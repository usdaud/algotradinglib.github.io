# Quartile

A quartile is a type of quantile which divides a data set into four equal parts. Each part represents a quarter of the distributed sampled population. Quartiles are used in [descriptive statistics](../d/descriptive_statistics.md) to understand and interpret data distributions. They are especially useful for summarizing data sets and identifying trends, [skewness](../s/skewness.md), and outliers. The three main quartiles are the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2 or the [median](../m/median.md)), and the third quartile (Q3).

## Understanding Quartiles

Quartiles are values that divide a data set into quarters, forming part of a specific kind of quantiles in [statistics](../s/statistics.md). These statistical measures are essential for getting a detailed sense of the data's spread and can be crucial for more sophisticated statistical analysis and modeling.

### Calculation of Quartiles

The data must be sorted in ascending [order](../o/order.md) before the quartiles can be calculated. Here are the steps for computing the quartiles:

1. **Arrange Data**: First, arrange the data in ascending [order](../o/order.md).
2. **Find the [Median](../m/median.md) (Q2)**: The second quartile (Q2) is the [median](../m/median.md) of the data set. If the number of observations (n) is odd, the [median](../m/median.md) is the middle number. If n is even, it is the average of the two middle numbers.
3. **Find the First Quartile (Q1)**: The first quartile (Q1) is the [median](../m/median.md) of the lower half of the data set (excluding Q2 if n is odd).
4. **Find the Third Quartile (Q3)**: The third quartile (Q3) is the [median](../m/median.md) of the upper half of the data set (excluding Q2 if n is odd).

### Example

Consider a data set: 6, 47, 49, 15, 48, 16, 51, 22, 5, 18, 17. 

1. **Sort the Data**: 5, 6, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 47, 48, 49, 51
2. **Calculate Q2 ([Median](../m/median.md))**: 
   - There are 11 numbers, so the middle one is the 6th number: 18 (Q2)
3. **Calculate Q1**:
   - The lower half is 5, 6, 15, 16, 17
   - [Median](../m/median.md) of lower half (Q1) is 15
4. **Calculate Q3**:
   - The upper half is 22, 47, 48, 49, 51
   - [Median](../m/median.md) of upper half (Q3) is 48

Therefore, Q1 = 15, Q2 = 18, and Q3 = 48.

## Applications in Finance and Trading

Quartiles can be incredibly useful in the realms of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading. They can help traders and financial analysts understand the performance of investment portfolios and identify opportunities for further analysis. Here are some specific applications:

### Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial in [finance](../f/finance.md). Quartiles can be used to understand the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of returns and identify unexpected anomalies or outliers, which could signify potential risks. For example, if the returns of an [asset](../a/asset.md) are highly skewed, it might indicate a higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Performance Measurement

In trading, quartiles can measure how various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) or financial instruments perform. For example, say we have the returns of different mutual funds. Using the first and third quartiles, we can identify the spread of returns and understand how different funds perform relative to each other.

### Value at Risk (VaR)

[Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) is a popular [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) measure. Quartiles can help in its calculation by understanding the different percentiles of potential returns.

### Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), understanding the spread and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of historical price movements can help in designing more effective [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). Quartiles can be used to divide price data into segments, helping to identify potential entry and exit points for trades.

## Quartiles and Box Plots

A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a visual representation of the quartiles. It offers a clear graphical image of the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of data and highlights levels of [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) and [skewness](../s/skewness.md). The box plot consists of a box, whose edges represent Q1 and Q3, and a line inside the box to show the [median](../m/median.md) (Q2). "Whiskers" extend from the box to the smallest and largest values in the data set within 1.5 IQR (Interquartile [Range](../r/range.md), which is Q3-Q1) from the quartiles. Data points outside this [range](../r/range.md) are often considered outliers.

### Interpretation of a Box Plot

- **Box**: The central 50% of the data.
- **Line within the Box**: The [median](../m/median.md) (Q2).
- **Whiskers**: The [range](../r/range.md) of the data within 1.5 IQR of the lower and upper quartiles.
- **Outliers**: Data points beyond 1.5 IQR from the quartiles.

## Statistical Insights

Quartiles provide meaningful insights that are often not visible through other basic statistical measures like mean or [mode](../m/mode.md). These insights include:

1. **Interquartile [Range](../r/range.md) (IQR)**: This is the difference between Q3 and Q1 and helps understand the spread of the central 50% of the data.
2. **[Skewness](../s/skewness.md)**: Quartiles can indicate whether the data is skewed, showing the symmetry of the data [distribution](../d/distribution.md).
3. **Outliers**: Identifying outliers is crucial as they can significantly influence the results.

## Real-World Scenario: Portfolio Management

Consider an investment portfolio. Using historical [return](../r/return.md) data for each [asset](../a/asset.md) in the portfolio, an analyst can calculate the quartiles. If the first quartile (Q1) of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) is higher than the [median](../m/median.md) (Q2) of another [asset](../a/asset.md), it might be assumed that the first [asset](../a/asset.md) is generally a better performer. Similarly, understanding the interquartile [range](../r/range.md) (IQR) helps in assessing the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and stability of returns.

## Advanced Applications in FinTech and Algo-Trading

In FinTech and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algo-trading), quartiles help in creating [robust](../r/robust.md) models that can lead to more effective [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Machine Learning Models

Quartiles ensure that [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models are trained on properly segmented data. Quartile-based segmentation might be used in [clustering algorithms](../c/clustering_algorithms.md) or regression models to ensure a balanced training set.

### Backtesting Strategies

Historical data is divided into quartiles to identify different [market](../m/market.md) conditions. By creating a strategy based on different quartiles, traders can test how various conditions affect their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### High-Frequency Trading

In high-frequency trading, the short-term price movements can be analyzed using quartiles to understand rapid fluctuations and price points for trading decisions.

### Custom Indicators

Quartile-based custom indicators might be more sensitive to [market](../m/market.md) conditions compared to traditional indicators. This sensitivity can help in making timely trading decisions.

## Conclusion

Quartiles are a foundational statistical tool that offers deep insights into data [distribution](../d/distribution.md). In [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, their applications are vast, from basic [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment to advanced [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). They provide a detailed view of data trends, identify outliers, and can significantly enhance the effectiveness of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and financial models.

By understanding and utilizing quartiles, financial analysts, and traders can [gain](../g/gain.md) superior insights, making more informed decisions to optimize returns and manage risks effectively.
