# Quantitative Analysis Tools

[Quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) (QA) in the context of trading refers to the use of mathematical and statistical methods to evaluate investment opportunities and manage risks. QA is a cornerstone of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), where sophisticated models and algorithms are developed to make trading decisions based on quantitative data. This field combines various disciplines such as [economics](../e/economics.md), [statistics](../s/statistics.md), mathematics, and computer science to create [robust](../r/robust.md), high-performance [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
