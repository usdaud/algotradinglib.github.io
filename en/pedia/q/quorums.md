# Quorums

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), a quorum refers to the minimum number of members of a deliberative assembly or a board who must be present in [order](../o/order.md) to conduct the [business](../b/business.md) of that group. This concept is vital as it ensures that decisions made are representative of the wider group's membership, rather than a small, potentially unrepresentative minority.

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

Quorums are typically specified in the bylaws or constitutive documents of a [corporation](../c/corporation.md), organization, or governing body. They often correspond with regulatory frameworks and laws such as [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) regulations imposed by stock exchanges and securities regulators.

For example, the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) demands specific quorum requirements for publicly [listed](../l/listed.md) companies. Similarly, stock exchanges such as the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) and [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) have their own rules regarding quorums to ensure fairness and proper governance.

## Types of Quorums

### Simple Majority

This is the most common type of quorum, where more than half of the members must be present. For example, in a board consisting of 10 members, a minimum of 6 must be present to form a quorum.

### Supermajority

This type requires a higher number of members to be present, often two-thirds or three-quarters. This is generally invoked for crucial decisions like amendments to bylaws or mergers and acquisitions.

### Absolute Numbers

Some organizations set the quorum as an absolute number, regardless of the total size of the board or assembly. For instance, a fixed number like 5 members should always be present.

## Importance of Quorums

### Legitimacy

Quorums provide legitimacy to the decision-making process. Without a quorum, any decisions made could be considered invalid or challenged legally.

### Accountability

Ensuring that key decisions have a minimum level of scrutiny and input upholds the accountability of board members or assembly participants.

### Efficiency

While a quorum prevents a small number of members from making decisions, it also ensures that the meetings are not delayed by needing every single member to be present.

## Quorums in Corporate Governance

In corporate settings, quorums play a critical role especially in board meetings and annual general meetings (AGMs). These quorums are often defined in the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s bylaws and may vary depending on the size and nature of the organization.

### Board Meetings

For board meetings, a quorum ensures that a productive and representative meeting can take place. This is crucial for maintaining good [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) practices.

### Annual General Meetings

AGMs often require a quorum to make significant decisions like the election of directors, approval of [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), and other important resolutions. Without a quorum, these decisions might be deferred, causing operational delays.

### Special Meetings

Special meetings, such as those convened to discuss extraordinary matters or crises, often require a supermajority quorum to proceed, given the criticality of the issues involved.

## Consequences of Not Meeting Quorum

If a quorum is not present, the meeting may need to be adjourned and rescheduled. Here are a few scenarios:

1. **Adjournment:** The meeting is postponed to a later date.
2. **Proxies:** In some cases, members might be allowed to participate via [proxy](../p/proxy.md) to achieve the quorum.
3. **Reduced Quorum:** Some bylaws might allow for a reduced quorum at a reconvened meeting after the first attempt fails.

## Modern Technological Impact on Quorums

With advancements in technology, the way quorums are achieved has evolved. [Video conferencing](../v/video_conferencing.md), telephone conferences, and virtual [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meetings have made it easier to achieve quorum requirements.

### Virtual Meetings

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations shifted to virtual meetings, which posed new challenges and opportunities for achieving quorums. Virtual meeting platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and WebEx have features that help in establishing and verifying quorum presence.

### Electronic Voting

Electronic voting systems enable members to vote from remote locations, thus contributing to quorum electronically. This can be particularly useful for large organizations with geographically dispersed members.

## Special Considerations in Financial Institutions

### Banks

In banks, achieving a quorum is particularly important for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) committees where decisions related to lending, [asset management](../a/asset_management.md), and compliance are taken.

### Investment Firms

For [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and investment firms, quorums are essential during meetings where strategic decisions on [portfolio management](../p/par.md), [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment, and investment strategies are made.

### Insurance Companies

For [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, quorums are crucial for claims management, audit committees, and financial reporting.

## Case Study: NASDAQ

[NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md), one of the largest stock exchanges in the world, has specific requirements for quorums in the context of [listed](../l/listed.md) companies. According to [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)'s Listing Rules, a company's annual meeting of shareholders must adhere to the following quorum requirements:
- A majority of [shares](../s/shares.md) must be present in person or by [proxy](../p/proxy.md).
- The specific percentage of the quorum must be stated in the company's governing documents.

## Conclusion

In summary, quorums are indispensable for ensuring the legitimacy, accountability, and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of decision-making processes within various organizations, especially in the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md). The advancement of technology has further facilitated the achievement of quorums, making it easier for geographically dispersed members to participate. Whether in board meetings, AGMs, or special meetings, a quorum is a foundational element of good governance and effective organizational management.
