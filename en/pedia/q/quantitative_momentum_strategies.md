# Quantitative Momentum Strategies

[Momentum investing](../m/momentum_investing.md) is a financial strategy that aims to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the continuance of existing trends in the [market](../m/market.md). This strategy is based on the premise that [stocks](../s/stock.md) that have performed well in the past [will](../w/will.md) continue to do well in the future, and those that have performed poorly [will](../w/will.md) continue to decline. [Quantitative momentum](../q/quantitative_momentum.md) strategies, in particular, [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and statistical techniques to identify and invest in securities that exhibit strong [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

### Definition and Basics

[Momentum](../m/momentum.md) in [finance](../f/finance.md) typically refers to the rate of acceleration of a [security](../s/security.md)'s price or the [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md) of a [security](../s/security.md)'s price. [Quantitative momentum](../q/quantitative_momentum.md) strategies specifically use historical data to identify and respond to [momentum](../m/momentum.md) signals. Generally, these strategies involve the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering historical price data for a broad set of securities.
2. **Signal Generation:** Computing [momentum](../m/momentum.md) signals, such as past returns over different time horizons.
3. **Stock Selection:** Based on computed signals, selecting [stocks](../s/stock.md) that show strong [positive momentum](../p/positive_momentum.md).
4. **Portfolio Construction:** Allocating [capital](../c/capital.md) to the selected [stocks](../s/stock.md) while considering factors like [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).
5. **Trading and [Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md):** Implementing buy/sell decisions and periodically [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) the portfolio to maintain the desired [momentum](../m/momentum.md) exposure.

### Types of Momentum

[Momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies can be broadly categorized into two types:

1. **Absolute [Momentum](../m/momentum.md):** Also known as "time-series [momentum](../m/momentum.md)," this strategy involves evaluating the past performance of a [security](../s/security.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md) if its performance exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., a positive [return](../r/return.md) over the past 12 months). If the past performance is below the threshold, the strategy would either short the [security](../s/security.md) or move the [capital](../c/capital.md) to a [risk-free asset](../r/risk-free_asset.md).

2. **Relative [Momentum](../m/momentum.md):** Also termed "cross-sectional [momentum](../m/momentum.md)," this strategy involves ranking a [universe of securities](../u/universe_of_securities.md) based on their past performance and [investing](../i/investing.md) in the top performers. For example, if analyzing the S&P 500, the strategy might involve going long on the top 20% of [stocks](../s/stock.md) with the highest past returns and shorting the bottom 20%.

### Key Concepts and Metrics

1. **Look-back Period:** The time frame over which past returns are measured. Common look-back periods [range](../r/range.md) from 3 to 12 months.
2. **[Holding Period](../h/holding_period.md):** The [duration](../d/duration.md) for which the assets are held once selected. Many strategies rebalance monthly or quarterly.
3. **Signal Strength:** The magnitude of past returns used to rank the securities.
4. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Adjustment:** Modifying [momentum](../m/momentum.md) signals by incorporating [volatility](../v/volatility.md) measures to reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with high [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md).
5. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Techniques such as [diversification](../d/diversification.md), [volatility](../v/volatility.md) targeting, and [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) used to manage potential downsides.

### Empirical Evidence

Numerous academic studies support the efficacy of [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies. For example, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) showed that a strategy of buying past winners and selling past losers generated significant positive returns. Similarly, Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) demonstrated that [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies worked across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and geographic regions.

### Practical Applications

#### Implementation in Funds

Several investment funds and ETFs incorporate [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies to construct their portfolios. Examples include:

- **AQR [Capital](../c/capital.md) Management:** AQR offers funds such as the AQR Large Cap [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) Style [Fund](../f/fund.md), focusing on [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md) exhibiting strong [momentum](../m/momentum.md). More details can be found at AQR Capital Management.

- **[iShares](../i/ishares.md) Edge MSCI USA [Momentum Factor](../m/momentum_factor.md) ETF (MTUM):** This ETF aims to track an [index](../i/index_instrument.md) that targets U.S. large- and mid-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) with high [momentum](../m/momentum.md) characteristics.

#### Quantitative Models

Numerous [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) have been developed to optimize [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies:
- **The [Dual Momentum](../d/dual_momentum.md) Model:** Developed by Gary Antonacci, this model combines absolute and relative [momentum](../m/momentum.md), enhancing returns while reducing [risk](../r/risk.md). More details can be found in his book "[Dual Momentum](../d/dual_momentum.md) [Investing](../i/investing.md)" and on his online platform Optimal Momentum.

### Challenges and Considerations

1. **[Turnover](../t/turnover.md) and [Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md):** High [turnover](../t/turnover.md) rates can lead to significant [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), which may erode returns.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Impact:** Large trades can move the [market](../m/market.md), particularly in less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md), adversely affecting the entry and exit prices.
3. **Regime Change:** [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies can suffer during [market](../m/market.md) regime changes, such as sudden shifts from [bull](../b/bull.md) to bear markets.

### Conclusion

[Quantitative momentum](../q/quantitative_momentum.md) strategies rely on systematic approaches to harness the persistence of trends in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). By integrating [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md), empirical evidence, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques, these strategies [offer](../o/offer.md) a compelling framework for investors seeking to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md). However, like all investment strategies, they require careful consideration of [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), [market](../m/market.md) impacts, and changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
