# QUID (Quasi Universal Intergalactic Denomination)

## Definition
QUID, short for Quasi Universal Intergalactic [Denomination](../d/denomination.md), is a space [currency](../c/currency.md) concept developed by scientists and economists. While not a [functional currency](../f/functional_currency.md), it represents a theoretical approach to interplanetary [commerce](../c/commerce.md) and financial transactions in space exploration scenarios.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Material Composition
- Made from a polymer material, similar to many modern banknotes
- Designed to withstand extreme temperatures and cosmic radiation

### 2. Denominations
- Comes in different denominations, each with a unique shape and color
- Shapes are designed to be easily distinguishable in zero-gravity environments

### 3. Security Features
- Incorporates advanced anti-counterfeiting measures
- Includes embedded identification chips for tracking and verification

### 4. Universal Design
- Created to be recognizable and usable by various potential alien species
- Utilizes mathematical symbols and astronomical imagery instead of human-centric designs

## Conceptual Applications

### 1. Space Tourism
- Potential use in future commercial space travel
- Could serve as a souvenir or collectible item for space tourists

### 2. Interplanetary Trade
- Theoretical [medium of exchange](../m/medium_of_exchange.md) for [commerce](../c/commerce.md) between Earth and future space colonies
- Designed to facilitate transactions in various gravitational environments

### 3. Space Mission Logistics
- Potential use in compensating astronauts or settling accounts in long-term space missions
- Could serve as a standardized [value](../v/value.md) system for resource allocation in space

## Advantages

1. **Durability**: Designed to withstand extreme space conditions
2. **Universality**: Attempts to create a [currency](../c/currency.md) concept not tied to any single planet or species
3. **Innovation**: Encourages thinking about financial systems beyond Earth-bound concepts

## Limitations

1. **Theoretical Nature**: Currently exists only as a concept, not a [functional currency](../f/functional_currency.md)
2. **Earth-Centric Design**: Despite attempts at universality, still based on human understanding of [commerce](../c/commerce.md)
3. **Practicality**: Electronic or digital currencies might be more practical for actual space use

## Historical Context
- Developed in 2007 by scientists from the National Space Centre and the University of Leicester
- Part of a broader discussion on the [economics](../e/economics.md) of space exploration and potential future scenarios

## Cultural Impact
- Has been featured in discussions about future space [economics](../e/economics.md)
- Serves as an educational tool to spark [interest](../i/interest.md) in space science and [economics](../e/economics.md) among students and the public

## Related Concepts
- Space-based cryptocurrencies
- Resource-based economies in potential space colonies
- International agreements on space resource utilization

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for QUID (Quasi Universal Intergalactic Denomination) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating QUID (Quasi Universal Intergalactic Denomination) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For QUID (Quasi Universal Intergalactic Denomination), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying QUID (Quasi Universal Intergalactic Denomination). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use QUID (Quasi Universal Intergalactic Denomination) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
