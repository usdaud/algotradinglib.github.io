# Quantitative Credit Analysis

Quantitative [Credit](../c/credit.md) Analysis (QCA) is a systematic approach to evaluating the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of borrowers—ranging from individual consumers to large corporations—using mathematical and statistical techniques. This method involves the application of various [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and data analysis tools to assess the probability of [default](../d/default.md) (PD), loss given [default](../d/default.md) (LGD), and exposure at [default](../d/default.md) (EAD), among other [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) components. The advent of advanced computing and [big data analytics](../b/big_data_analytics_in_trading.md) has significantly enhanced the ability to process large datasets and generate accurate, real-time [credit](../c/credit.md) assessments, which are crucial for financial institutions, investors, and regulators.

## Fundamentals of Quantitative Credit Analysis

Quantitative [Credit](../c/credit.md) Analysis integrates traditional [credit](../c/credit.md) analysis methods with [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md) techniques. Here are some key components and methodologies involved:

### Probability of Default (PD)

PD describes the likelihood that a borrower [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md) on their [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) within a specified horizon, usually one year. Techniques involved in estimating PD include:

- **[Logistic regression](../l/logistic_regression_in_trading.md) models:** Commonly used to predict binary outcomes, such as [default](../d/default.md) or no [default](../d/default.md). By examining [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) and other key indicators, [logistic regression](../l/logistic_regression_in_trading.md) helps in estimating the PD.
- **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) Models:** Techniques such as [Random Forests](../r/random_forests_in_trading.md), [Support Vector Machines](../s/support_vector_machines_in_trading.md) (SVM), and [Neural Networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) more accurate PD estimations by capturing complex, non-linear relationships within the data.

### Loss Given Default (LGD)

LGD is the proportion of the total exposure that a [lender](../l/lender.md) expects to lose if the borrower defaults. Methods to estimate LGD include:

- **[Recovery Rate](../r/recovery_rate.md) Analysis:** Historical data is analyzed to determine average recovery rates across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.
- **Regression Models:** These are used to estimate the relationship between various factors (like [collateral](../c/collateral.md) type, seniority of [debt](../d/debt.md)) and the [recovery rate](../r/recovery_rate.md).

### Exposure at Default (EAD)

EAD represents the total [value](../v/value.md) that is at [risk](../r/risk.md) when a borrower defaults. It is crucial for calculating regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements and determining the expected loss. Techniques to estimate EAD include:

- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Conversion [Factor](../f/factor.md) (CCF):** This [factor](../f/factor.md) is applied to off-balance-sheet items to estimate the potential exposure.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** These simulations can help in estimating EAD by modeling various scenarios and their probabilities.

## Data Sources and Types

### Internal Data

Internal data includes information gathered within the financial institution and covers:

- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) History:** Detailed records of past borrowing and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) behavior.
- **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Data:** Data from [customer](../c/customer.md) transactions that can provide insights into spending behavior and financial stability.

### External Data

External data can supplement internal data and includes:

- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Bureaus:** These organizations collect and maintain [credit](../c/credit.md) information about consumers and businesses, e.g., Experian, Equifax.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Data:** Includes stock prices, [bond](../b/bond.md) yields, and other financial metrics that can indicate the [credit](../c/credit.md) health of publicly traded companies.
- **[Economic Indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md):** Metrics such as [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates, [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and GDP growth can impact [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).

## Key Models in Quantitative Credit Analysis

### Credit Scoring Models

[Credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models assign a numerical score to a borrower based on various attributes, which could include:

- **FICO Scores:** Widely used in consumer lending. The score ranges from 300 to 850 and is based on five factors: [payment](../p/payment.md) history, amount owed, length of [credit](../c/credit.md) history, new [credit](../c/credit.md), and types of [credit](../c/credit.md) used.
- **[Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) Model:** Developed by Edward Altman, this model is used to predict the [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) of [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) companies.

### Structural Models

[Structural models](../s/structural_models_in_trading.md), such as the [Merton Model](../m/merton_model.md), use a [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [equity](../e/equity.md) [value](../v/value.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to estimate the probability of [default](../d/default.md). These models view a company's [equity](../e/equity.md) as a [call option](../c/call_option.md) on its assets.

### Reduced-form Models

Reduced-form models, like the Jarrow-Turnbull Model, do not require in-depth financial information about the borrower. Instead, they use observable [market](../m/market.md) prices to infer the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).

### Credit Portfolio Models

[Credit](../c/credit.md) portfolio models assess the overall [risk](../r/risk.md) of a portfolio of loans or [credit](../c/credit.md) assets. Examples include:

- **CreditRisk+:** A statistical model based on [actuarial science](../a/actuarial_science.md) principles that examines the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [default](../d/default.md) rates.
- **Moody’s Analytics [Portfolio Manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md):** Integrates various types of [credit](../c/credit.md) risks, including [default](../d/default.md) and migration risks, to optimize [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md).

## Software and Tools

Modern QCA leverages sophisticated [software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) and platforms:

- **SAS [Credit](../c/credit.md) Scoring:** Offers end-to-end capabilities for building, validating, deploying, and monitoring [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models. [SAS Credit Scoring](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/credit-scoring.html)
