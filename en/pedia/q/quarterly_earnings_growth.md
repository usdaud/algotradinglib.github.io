# Quarterly Earnings Growth

Quarterly [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth is a critical metric in the lexicon of [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), reflecting a company's profitability [trend](../t/trend.md) over consecutive fiscal quarters. It is primarily utilized by investors and analysts to gauge the trajectory of a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), its performance in relation to its historical results, and its comparability to [industry](../i/industry.md) peers. In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (algotrading), quarterly [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth becomes an indispensable [factor](../f/factor.md) for developing [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) that guide trading decisions. This document delves into the intricacies of quarterly [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth, its calculation, implications for [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), and how it is employed within the framework of algotrading.

## Definition and Calculation

Quarterly [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth compares the net [income](../i/income.md) or [earnings](../e/earnings.md) of a company from one fiscal quarter to the corresponding quarter of the previous year. It provides insight into the company's capacity to increase profits over time. The formula for calculating quarterly [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth is as follows:

\[ \text{Quarterly [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Growth} = \left( \frac{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md)}_{\text{current quarter}} - \text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md)}_{\text{same quarter last year}}}{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md)}_{\text{same quarter last year}}} \right) \times 100 \]

For example, if a company reports net [earnings](../e/earnings.md) of $5 million in Q2 of 2023 and had [earnings](../e/earnings.md) of $4 million in Q2 of 2022, the quarterly [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth would be:

\[ \text{Quarterly [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Growth} = \left( \frac{5,000,000 - 4,000,000}{4,000,000} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]
