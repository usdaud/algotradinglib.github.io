# Quant Trading

Quant trading, short for quantitative trading, is the use of data, statistical models, and algorithms to make trading decisions. It emphasizes systematic rules, repeatability, and risk control rather than discretionary judgment.

## Core elements
- Data collection and cleaning.
- Signal research using statistical methods.
- Backtesting with realistic costs and constraints.
- Execution and risk management automation.

## Common strategy types
- Trend following and momentum models.
- Mean reversion and statistical arbitrage.
- Factor based equity models.
- Event driven or news based models.

## Example
A quant strategy ranks stocks by a combination of momentum and value factors, rebalances monthly, and sizes positions based on volatility targets.

## Risks
Quant models can fail when market regimes shift or when data assumptions break. Overfitting and hidden correlations are common pitfalls.

## Practical notes
Successful quant trading requires strong data infrastructure, careful validation, and disciplined execution.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Quant Trading and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Quant Trading as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Quant Trading, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Quant Trading. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Quant Trading alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
