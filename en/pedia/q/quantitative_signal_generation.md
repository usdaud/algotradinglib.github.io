# Quantitative Signal Generation

Quantitative signal generation is a cornerstone concept in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), where [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and statistical techniques are utilized to make trading decisions. This technique involves analyzing historical data and [market](../m/market.md) variables to generate signals that indicate when to buy or sell financial instruments. The adoption of [quantitative strategies](../q/quantitative_strategies_in_trading.md) helps in making systematic, emotion-free decisions and can involve complex methods spanning [multiple](../m/multiple.md) disciplines, including [statistics](../s/statistics.md), [econometrics](../e/econometrics_in_trading.md), [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), and computer science.
