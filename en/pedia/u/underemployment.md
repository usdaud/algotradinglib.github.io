# Underemployment

Underemployment is an economic condition characterized by the underutilization of a worker's skills, experience, or availability. This term is often contrasted with [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), which denotes a complete lack of work. Underemployment can be more nuanced and can include various forms, such as working part-time when full-time work is desired, holding a job that does not fully utilize one’s skills, or earning less than what’s needed to cover essential living expenses.

## Types of Underemployment

Underemployment can be categorized into several types:

### Visible Underemployment
Visible underemployment involves workers who are employed in a part-time capacity but wish and are available to work full-time. This form of underemployment can be quantitatively measured and is typically captured in labor force surveys. These workers are working fewer hours than desired and this can have significant financial and social implications.

### Invisible or Skill-based Underemployment
Invisible underemployment is harder to quantify and involves individuals who are employed full-time but in jobs that do not fully utilize their skills, qualifications, or experiences. For example, a college graduate working in a job that requires only a high school diploma would fall into this category. This type of underemployment can impact job satisfaction and career progression and may lead to inefficiencies in the [labor market](../l/labor_market.md).

### Income-based Underemployment
[Income](../i/income.md)-based underemployment refers to situations where workers have jobs that do not pay enough to meet basic living expenses, regardless of whether the job is part-time or full-time. This form of underemployment is often observed in economies with a high prevalence of low-wage jobs and can lead to issues such as [poverty](../p/poverty.md) and inadequate [standard of living](../s/standard_of_living.md).

## Causes of Underemployment

Several factors can contribute to underemployment, including:

### Economic Downturns
Economic recessions and downturns often force businesses to cut costs, which can translate into reduced hours, lower wages, or a higher prevalence of part-time positions. During these periods, even skilled workers may take on jobs that do not fully utilize their skills just to have some form of [income](../i/income.md).

### Technological Changes
Advancements in technology can lead to job displacement as certain skills become obsolete. Workers may find themselves underemployed as their existing roles are phased out, and they are forced to accept positions in different sectors that may not match their expertise.

### Educational Mismatches
A mismatch between the qualifications of job seekers and the requirements of available jobs can lead to underemployment. For instance, an [oversupply](../o/oversupply.md) of graduates in a particular field can result in many of them accepting positions that do not require a degree.

### Structural Changes in the Economy
Shifts in the [economy](../e/economy.md), such as the transition from [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) to service-based industries, can also contribute to underemployment. Workers trained in declining industries may have difficulty finding employment that matches their skill sets in the emerging sectors.

### Regional Disparities
Underemployment can vary significantly across different regions. Areas with limited economic opportunities may see higher rates of underemployment as workers accept any available job regardless of its alignment with their skills and aspirations.

## Implications of Underemployment

### Personal and Social Impact
Underemployment can significantly affect individual well-being, leading to financial stress, lower job satisfaction, and reduced opportunities for career advancement. On a societal level, widespread underemployment can result in a loss of [human capital](../h/human_capital.md), diminished consumer spending, and increased social inequality.

### Economic Efficiency
When workers are not employed to their full potential, there is a loss of [productivity](../p/productivity.md) and [economic efficiency](../e/economic_efficiency.md). This underutilization of human resources can hinder [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and innovation.

### Policy Considerations
Addressing underemployment requires targeted strategies, such as investment in education and retraining programs, policies that encourage full-time employment, and economic incentives for industries to create high-quality jobs. Policymakers need to focus on creating an enabling environment where workers can find opportunities that match their skills and aspirations.

## Measuring Underemployment

### Labor Force Surveys
Labor force surveys are commonly used to measure underemployment. These surveys collect data on employment status, hours worked, job satisfaction, and whether individuals are working in their preferred occupation.

### Underemployment Rate
The underemployment rate is a key metric that complements the [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) in understanding [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) conditions. It is calculated by dividing the number of underemployed workers by the total labor force and is often broken down into different categories (e.g., part-time vs. skill-based underemployment).

## Real-World Examples

### Case Study: Underemployment in the United States
The United States has experienced various periods of underemployment, particularly during economic recessions. For example, following the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), many workers with high levels of education and experience found themselves in lower-paying, part-time, or temporary positions. Programs aimed at retraining and upskilling workers have been implemented to combat this [issue](../i/issue.md), but underemployment remains a challenge.

### Case Study: Underemployment in Developing Countries
In many developing countries, underemployment is prevalent due to a lack of [industrialization](../i/industrialization.md) and insufficient job opportunities. Agricultural and informal sectors often dominate the [job market](../j/job_market.md), leading to a significant portion of the workforce being underemployed. Initiatives aimed at economic development, improving education, and fostering entrepreneurship are critical in addressing underemployment in these regions.

## Technological Solutions and Fintech

### Role of Fintech
Fintech companies can play a significant role in addressing underemployment by providing innovative financial products and services that support entrepreneurship, [gig economy](../g/gig_economy.md) workers, and small businesses. By [offering](../o/offering.md) access to [credit](../c/credit.md), [payment](../p/payment.md) solutions, and [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) tools, fintech can help individuals create their own employment opportunities and better manage irregular incomes.

**Example**: Kiva is a non-[profit](../p/profit.md) organization that enables individuals to lend [money](../m/money.md) to low-[income](../i/income.md) entrepreneurs and students, addressing underemployment by empowering people to start and grow their own businesses.

### Use of Data Analytics
[Big data](../b/big_data_in_trading.md) and analytics can help identify underemployment trends and patterns, enabling targeted interventions. For example, analyzing [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) data can help policymakers and organizations understand which sectors have a high prevalence of underemployment and tailor their strategies accordingly.

### Platforms for Job Matching
Online job platforms and algorithms can improve job matching by better aligning workers’ skills with job requirements. These platforms use [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) to connect job seekers with positions that match their qualifications more accurately than traditional methods.

**Example**: LinkedIn uses [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) to recommend jobs to users based on their profile information, potentially reducing skill-based underemployment by improving job matching [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

## Conclusion

Underemployment is a complex and multifaceted [issue](../i/issue.md) that has significant implications for both individuals and economies. By understanding the various forms and causes of underemployment, policymakers, businesses, and individuals can work towards solutions that improve job quality, better utilize skills, and foster [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). Addressing underemployment requires a comprehensive approach that includes education, economic policy, technological innovation, and targeted interventions to create a more efficient and equitable [labor market](../l/labor_market.md).
