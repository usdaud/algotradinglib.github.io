# United Nations (UN)

The United Nations (UN) is an international organization founded in 1945 after the [Second World](../s/second_world.md) War by 51 countries committed to maintaining international peace and [security](../s/security.md), developing friendly relations among nations, achieving international cooperation, and being a center for harmonizing the actions of nations. The UN provided a platform for dialogue and cooperation to enhance global stability and address issues that cross borders and affect [multiple](../m/multiple.md) countries. With its headquarters in New York City, the UN now comprises 193 member states, reflecting its universal mission.

### History and Formation

The idea of an organization involving [multiple](../m/multiple.md) nations to promote peace and cooperation was conceived during the turmoil of World War II. The name "United Nations" came from U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the Charter of the United Nations was drafted at a conference in San Francisco in April 1945. It came into force on October 24, 1945, a date now celebrated as United Nations Day.

### Structure and Main Organs

The United Nations' [organizational structure](../o/organizational_structure.md) comprises several main organs, each with specific responsibilities:

1. **General Assembly**: This is the main deliberative body where all 193 member states are represented. Each country has one vote, regardless of size or power. The General Assembly meets annually to address issues of global concern, and while its resolutions are not legally binding, they carry significant moral and political weight.

2. **[Security](../s/security.md) Council**: Charged with maintaining international peace and [security](../s/security.md), the [Security](../s/security.md) Council has 15 members: five permanent members with veto power (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms. Its decisions are binding and can include the imposition of sanctions or authorization of military force.

3. **International Court of Justice**: Located in The Hague, Netherlands, this [principal](../p/principal.md) judicial body settles legal disputes between countries and gives advisory opinions on international legal questions referred to it by UN organs and specialized agencies.

4. **Secretariat**: Headed by the Secretary-General, the Secretariat carries out the day-to-day work of the UN as mandated by the General Assembly, the [Security](../s/security.md) Council, and other organs. The Secretary-General acts as the spokesperson for the international community and often plays a key role in mediating conflicts.

5. **Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)**: This body coordinates the economic and social work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, functional commissions, and regional commissions. It has 54 members elected by the General Assembly for overlapping three-year terms.

6. **Trusteeship Council**: Established to oversee the administration of [trust](../t/trust.md) territories and ensure that their inhabitants were prepared for self-government, this body has suspended its operations since the last [trust](../t/trust.md) territory, Palau, gained independence in 1994.

### Specialized Agencies and Programs

The United Nations works through various specialized agencies, programs, and funds to address a wide array of global issues:

- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Focuses on international public health.
- **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)**: Promotes education, science, culture, and communication.
- **United Nations Children’s [Fund](../f/fund.md) (UNICEF)**: Provides humanitarian and developmental aid to children worldwide.
- **International Monetary [Fund](../f/fund.md) (IMF)**: Works to stabilize international [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates and facilitate development.
- **[World Bank](../w/world_bank.md)**: Provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries for development programs.

These agencies work independently but collaborate closely with the UN to address specific issues like health, education, labor, food [security](../s/security.md), international [finance](../f/finance.md), and human rights.

### Peacekeeping and Conflict Resolution

One of the primary roles of the UN is to prevent conflict and help parties in conflict make peace. Its peacekeeping missions involve military personnel, police officers, and civilian staff who help create conditions for lasting peace in war-torn regions. The UN does not have its own military force but relies on member states to contribute troops and police.

Examples of successful peacekeeping missions include the resolution of conflicts in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Timor-Leste. However, peacekeeping missions have also faced criticism over failures such as the Rwandan Genocide and the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia.

### Human Rights and Humanitarian Assistance

The UN promotes and protects human rights through various treaties and international laws. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, sets out fundamental human rights to be universally protected and has been translated into over 500 languages.

The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) works to promote and protect human rights that are guaranteed under international law. The UN also plays a key role in providing humanitarian assistance during emergencies such as natural disasters, armed conflicts, and pandemics. Through agencies like the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN delivers vital assistance and support to millions of people in need.

### Sustainable Development and Climate Change

The UN is at the forefront of efforts to address global development challenges. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015, sets out 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end [poverty](../p/poverty.md), protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next decade.

Climate change is a critical area of focus. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) leads global efforts to combat climate change, with landmark agreements such as the [Kyoto Protocol](../k/kyoto_protocol.md) and the Paris Agreement, which call for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and support for sustainable development.

### Criticisms and Reforms

Despite its many achievements, the United Nations faces criticism and calls for reform. Criticisms include:

- **[Bureaucracy](../b/bureaucracy.md) and inefficiency**: The large and complex structure of the UN can lead to slow decision-making processes and operational inefficiencies.
- **Power dynamics**: The veto power held by the five permanent members of the [Security](../s/security.md) Council is often criticized for being undemocratic and contributing to gridlock.
- **Accountability**: Allegations of mismanagement, corruption, and insufficient accountability mechanisms have plagued various UN agencies and programs.

Reform efforts have focused on enhancing [transparency](../t/transparency.md), accountability, and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). Initiatives include [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) the organization, improving financial management, and increasing representation from developing countries in decision-making processes.

### Conclusion

The United Nations plays a vital role in promoting international cooperation and addressing global challenges. From maintaining peace and [security](../s/security.md) to promoting sustainable development and human rights, the UN's work affects billions of lives worldwide. As the world confronts new and evolving challenges, the United Nations’ mission remains as crucial as ever, driving collective action towards a more peaceful, equitable, and sustainable future.
