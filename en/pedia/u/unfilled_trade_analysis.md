# Unfilled Trade Analysis

Unfilled trades, also known as [unexecuted orders](../u/unexecuted_orders.md) or missed trades, occur when buy or sell orders [fail](../f/fail.md) to be matched in the trading [market](../m/market.md). In high-frequency trading (HFT) and other [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (AT) strategies, unfilled trades can significantly impact performance and profitability. This document dives into the metrics, reasons, and implications of unfilled trades while also discussing various methods to analyze and mitigate these issues.

## Understanding Unfilled Trades 

Unfilled trades represent those orders placed by a trading algorithm that do not get executed due to various reasons such as lack of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), wrong timing, or [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). Unfilled trades can occur in both limit and [market](../m/market.md) orders:

- **Limit Orders:** These are set to execute at a specific price. The [trade](../t/trade.md) remains unfilled if the [market](../m/market.md) does not reach that price.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders:** These aim for immediate [execution](../e/execution.md) at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). If [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) is insufficient, the [order](../o/order.md) may be partially or completely unfilled.

## Key Metrics for Unfilled Trade Analysis

### Fill Rate
The fill rate or [execution](../e/execution.md) rate is the primary metric used to assess unfilled trades. It is calculated as:
```
Fill Rate = (Number of Filled Trades / Total Orders Placed) * 100
```
A lower fill rate can indicate potential issues in the strategy [execution](../e/execution.md) or [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Slippage
[Slippage](../s/slippage.md) measures the difference between the expected price of a [trade](../t/trade.md) and the actual fill price. High [slippage](../s/slippage.md) can be a signal of poor [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) or fast [market](../m/market.md) movements.

### Order Sizes and Duration
Tracking the size of [unfilled orders](../u/unfilled_orders.md) and how long they remain [open](../o/open.md) before cancellation offers insights into [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and the timing aspects of the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

## Common Reasons for Unfilled Trades

### Market Conditions
Volatile or thinly traded markets can often lead to unfilled trades. In periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), prices move rapidly, making it difficult for orders to be matched. In thin markets, low [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) means fewer counterparties available to take the opposite side of the [trade](../t/trade.md).

### Large Order Sizes
Large orders can significantly impact the [market](../m/market.md), causing price slippages. These orders may remain partially or wholly unfilled if there aren't enough counterparties willing to match the price and [volume](../v/volume.md).

### Inefficient Algorithms
Algorithms that do not adapt to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions are more likely to leave trades unfilled. Efficient algorithms need to adjust their parameters on-the-fly based on real-time data.

### Latency Issues
High latency in data feeds, [order routing](../o/order_routing.md), and [execution](../e/execution.md) can result in missed opportunities, as the [market](../m/market.md) situation might change by the time the [order](../o/order.md) reaches the trading venue.

## Implications of Unfilled Trades

### Reduced Profitability
Unfilled trades can lead to missed opportunities, which directly translates to lost profits. In the worst-case scenario, large proportions of unfilled trades can render a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) unviable.

### Increased Costs
Attempting to execute large orders in fragmented markets can incur additional costs such as increased [slippage](../s/slippage.md), higher trading fees, and potential [market impact costs](../m/market_impact_costs.md).

### Strategy Performance
Analyzing the rate of unfilled trades provides valuable feedback for refining [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). Continuous high rates of unfilled trades suggest the need for modifications in strategy, such as better timing, price adjustments, and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) considerations.

## Analytical Methods and Tools

### Historical Data Analysis
Using historical [market](../m/market.md) data helps identify patterns of unfilled trades. This analysis involves reviewing past [trade](../t/trade.md) submissions and executions to determine the conditions under which unfilled trades were most frequent.

### Simulation and Backtesting
Running simulated trades through past [market](../m/market.md) conditions helps visualize how different strategies affect the fill rates. [Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) helps fine-tune algorithm parameters before deploying live trades.

### Real-Time Monitoring
Using real-time dashboards to monitor [trade](../t/trade.md) executions and [unfilled orders](../u/unfilled_orders.md) allows traders to adapt quickly. Highlighting real-time [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) can pinpoint problems immediately.

### Statistical Methods
Advanced statistical methods, such as [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) techniques, can predict the likelihood of orders being unfilled under various conditions.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Smart Order Routing
Smart [order routing](../o/order_routing.md) (SOR) algorithms split orders across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) venues to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on available [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and improve [execution](../e/execution.md) chances. Companies like [IEX](https://www.iextrading.com) [offer](../o/offer.md) advanced tools for this purpose.

### Reducing Order Sizes
Breaking large orders into smaller chunks can reduce [market](../m/market.md) impact and increase the chances of [execution](../e/execution.md). Techniques such as "iceberg" orders—where only a portion of the [order](../o/order.md) is displayed, with the rest revealed as it gets filled—can be particularly effective.

### Adaptive Algorithms
Developing [adaptive algorithms](../a/adaptive_algorithms.md) that adjust [order](../o/order.md) parameters based on real-time [market](../m/market.md) feedback can reduce the occurrence of unfilled trades. [Adaptive algorithms](../a/adaptive_algorithms.md) can modify [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md), sizes, and their timing dynamically.

### Latency Reduction
[Investing](../i/investing.md) in low-latency [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), including faster data feeds and more efficient [order routing](../o/order_routing.md) networks, is essential in competitive trading environments. Companies such as [Colt Technology Services](https://www.colt.net) provide [robust](../r/robust.md) low-latency solutions for traders.

### Collaborating with Liquidity Providers
Building relationships with [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) providers helps ensure that orders are more likely to find matches. [Market](../m/market.md) makers and algorithmic [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) providers can [offer](../o/offer.md) additional opportunities for executing trades. Firms like [Virtu Financial](https://www.virtu.com) specialize in providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) solutions.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Algorithm Adaptation
A [quantitative trading](../q/quantitative_trading.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) observed an increased rate of unfilled trades during high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) sessions. By incorporating [real-time volatility](../r/real-time_volatility.md) data and adjusting their algorithm’s [order](../o/order.md) submission parameters, they managed to improve the fill rate by 20%.

### Case Study 2: Enhanced Order Routing
An investment [bank](../b/bank.md) employed a new smart [order routing](../o/order_routing.md) system that utilized a multi-venue strategy. As a result, their overall [execution](../e/execution.md) quality improved and the number of unfilled trades dropped by 15%.

## Conclusion

Unfilled trades are a critical aspect of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) with significant implications for strategy performance and profitability. Through in-depth analysis of historical data, real-time monitoring, and employing advanced tools and algorithms, traders can minimize the incidence of unfilled trades. The objective is to refine [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) continually to adapt to ever-evolving [market](../m/market.md) conditions and maintain a competitive edge.
