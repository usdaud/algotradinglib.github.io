# Unfiltered Market Data

## Introduction
In the realm of financial trading, data is power. [Market](../m/market.md) participants, including algorithmic traders, rely heavily on real-time information to make split-second decisions. [Market](../m/market.md) data comes in various forms and can be processed in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) ways to meet different trading objectives. One particularly significant type of data is unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data. This comprehensive guide aims to elaborate on what unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data is, its importance, how it is used in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), and the challenges associated with its utilization.

## What is Unfiltered Market Data?

Unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data refers to the raw, unprocessed data stream that disseminates information about all trading activities happening within a [market](../m/market.md). This includes every single [bid](../b/bid.md), ask, [trade](../t/trade.md), cancellation, and other [market](../m/market.md) events without any delay or [aggregation](../a/aggregation.md). Unlike filtered or processed data, which may be aggregated, delayed, or sampled to reduce its [volume](../v/volume.md), unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data presents a complete and continuous view of [market](../m/market.md) activities in real time.

### Types of Unfiltered Market Data

1. **Level I Data:**
 - This includes the best [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices, along with their respective sizes and the last [trade](../t/trade.md) price.
2. **Level II Data:**
 - Also known as [market depth](../m/market_depth.md) data, this includes all the bids and asks at different price levels, giving a deeper insight into [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
3. **Full [Order Book](../o/order_book.md) (Level III):**
 - This extends Level II data by including information such as [order](../o/order.md) additions, deletions, and modifications for all orders in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Importance of Unfiltered Market Data

### Real-Time Insights

For algorithmic traders, unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data provides real-time insights that are crucial for executing high-frequency [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Since these strategies often exploit tiny price inefficiencies that may only exist for milliseconds, the timeliness and completeness of [unfiltered data](../u/unfiltered_data_in_trading.md) are indispensable.

### Market Microstructure

Understanding the [market microstructure](../m/market_microstructure.md) is vital for developing sophisticated [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). Unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data offers a granular view of all [market](../m/market.md) orders and trades, helping traders understand the behavior of other participants, latency, and the impact of their own trades.

### Better Decision Making

With unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data, traders have access to a full spectrum of [market](../m/market.md) events, enabling them to make more informed decisions. The ability to analyze every single [trade](../t/trade.md), [bid](../b/bid.md), and ask provides a more comprehensive analytical framework.

## How Unfiltered Market Data is Used in Algorithmic Trading

### Strategy Development

Algorithms can be designed to recognize patterns or anomalies in unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data. For example, [high-frequency trading algorithms](../h/high-frequency_trading_algorithms.md) often look for momentary price discrepancies to execute trades that [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on these micro-opportunities.

### Backtesting

Unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data is essential for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Historical [unfiltered data](../u/unfiltered_data_in_trading.md) enables traders to simulate how their algorithm would have performed in real trading scenarios, assessing both risks and returns.

### Real-Time Analysis

In real-time trading, algorithms continuously analyze unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data to make quick decisions. Since this data provides a complete picture of the [market](../m/market.md) environment, the algorithms can adapt to dynamic changes more effectively.

### Risk Management

By analyzing unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data, traders can assess [market](../m/market.md) conditions with greater precision, helping them manage risks more effectively. Understanding the depth and breadth of [market](../m/market.md) orders can assist in setting more accurate stop-loss limits and other [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) measures.

### Arbitrage Opportunities

Unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data can also be used to identify [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities between different markets or instruments. The data enables algorithms to swiftly detect price discrepancies and execute trades to lock in [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits.

## Challenges in Using Unfiltered Market Data

### High Volume

One of the primary challenges associated with unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data is its sheer [volume](../v/volume.md). The data is generated at a high frequency and can quickly become overwhelming. Efficient data processing and storage solutions are required to manage this.

### Latency

For high-frequency trading, even a microsecond delay can mean the difference between [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss. The [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) to process unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data must be optimized to minimize latency.

### Data Quality

Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data is crucial. Poor data quality can lead to erroneous trading decisions and significant financial losses.

### Cost

Acquiring unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data can be expensive. Exchanges and data providers often charge high fees for access to this comprehensive data. Additionally, the [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) required to process and store this data also involves significant costs.

### Compliance

Regulations often require traders to maintain records of all trading activities, including the unfiltered [market](../m/market.md) data that influenced their decisions. Compliance with these regulations requires [robust](../r/robust.md) data management solutions.

## Providers of Unfiltered Market Data
