# Unadjusted Basis

In [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), the concept of "[basis](../b/basis.md)" is pivotal for determining the amount of [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss that [will](../w/will.md) be recognized upon the [sale](../s/sale.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md). While there are several types of [basis](../b/basis.md) calculations, the "unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md)" serves as the fundamental metric from which all subsequent adjustments are made. This article explores the concept of unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) in detail, explaining its definition, calculation, relevance, and different contexts where it is applied.

## Definition

The unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) is its original [value](../v/value.md), typically the purchase price, before any adjustments are made for factors such as [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), improvements, or other related costs. It is a straightforward measure that helps in calculating the initial investment into an [asset](../a/asset.md).

The unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) serves as the starting point for determining the adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md), which is more commonly used in tax calculations. Adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) takes into account various factors that can increase or decrease the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [value](../v/value.md) over time.

## Calculation

Calculating the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) is relatively straightforward. Here are the typical components:

1. **Purchase Price**: This is the most fundamental component. It is the amount of [money](../m/money.md) paid to acquire the [asset](../a/asset.md).
2. **[Acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) Costs**: These are additional expenses incurred to purchase the [asset](../a/asset.md). They could include legal fees, brokerage commissions, and other relevant costs directly attributable to the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

### Example Calculation

For instance, if you purchased a piece of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) for $200,000, and you paid $5,000 in closing costs and $2,000 in legal fees, the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) would be calculated as:

```
Purchase Price: $200,000
+ Closing Costs: $5,000
+ Legal Fees: $2,000
=========================
Unadjusted [Basis](../b/basis.md): $207,000
```

## Importance

Understanding the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) is crucial for various reasons:

1. **Tax Implications**: The unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) is often the starting point for calculating tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) when an [asset](../a/asset.md) is sold.
2. **[Financial Analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md)**: Investors use the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) as a key metric to measure the initial [capital](../c/capital.md) invested.
3. **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) Calculations**: For assets subject to [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) is the amount on which [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) calculations are initially based.
4. **[Portfolio Management](../p/par.md)**: Knowing the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) helps in assessing the performance of specific assets within a portfolio.

## Contexts of Application

The unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) can be applied across various types of assets:

1. **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md)**: For [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) is primarily the purchase price plus other [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) costs.
2. **[Stocks](../s/stock.md)**: For [stocks](../s/stock.md), the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) is generally the purchase price plus any commissions or fees paid during the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).
3. **[Business](../b/business.md) Investments**: For investments made in a [business](../b/business.md) venture, it represents the initial [capital](../c/capital.md) outlay plus any [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md)-related expenses.

### Example in Real Estate

Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a rental property for $300,000. They incur an additional $10,000 in closing costs and $4,000 in renovation expenses. The unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) of the property would be:

```
Purchase Price: $300,000
+ Closing Costs: $10,000
+ Renovation Expenses: $4,000
=========================
Unadjusted [Basis](../b/basis.md): $314,000
```

If the [investor](../i/investor.md) later installs a new roof for $15,000 or takes any actions that either add to or reduce the [basis](../b/basis.md), those actions affect the "adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md)" but not the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md).

### Example in Stocks

Consider an [investor](../i/investor.md) who purchases 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of Company XYZ for $50 per share and pays a $200 brokerage [commission](../c/commission.md). The unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) would be:

```
(100 [shares](../s/shares.md) * $50 per share): $5,000
+ Brokerage [Commission](../c/commission.md): $200
=========================
Unadjusted [Basis](../b/basis.md): $5,200
```

## Limitations

While the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) is a useful measure, it does come with certain limitations:

1. **Not Suitable for Long-Term Analysis**: The unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) doesn't account for changes in [value](../v/value.md) over time due to factors like [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), improvements, or additional expenditures.
2. **Simplistic View**: It provides a simplistic view of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [value](../v/value.md) and doesn't incorporate complexities that can affect real-world valuations.
3. **Irrelevance in Tax Calculations**: [Taxes](../t/taxes.md), especially [capital](../c/capital.md) gains [taxes](../t/taxes.md), are usually based on the adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) rather than the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md), making it less useful in [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md).

## Advanced Considerations

In more complex financial environments, the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) can contribute to various advanced calculations and analyses. Here are some scenarios where it holds relevance:

1. **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) Schedules**: For calculating [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) is the initial [value](../v/value.md) from which [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) starts.
2. **Amortization**: Similar to [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) is used in amortizing the cost of intangible assets over time.
3. **Investment Appraisals**: In investment appraisals, the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) serves as the initial cost figure, helping in calculating returns on investment (ROI).

## Conclusion

The unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) may seem like a basic and straightforward concept, but it plays a critical role in various financial and investment analyses. Whether you're dealing with [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), [stocks](../s/stock.md), or [business](../b/business.md) investments, knowing the unadjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) helps you understand your initial footing and sets the stage for more complex calculations and adjustments. Knowledge of this term and its implications can significantly enhance one's ability to make informed financial decisions.
