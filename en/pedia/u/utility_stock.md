# Utility Stock

A utility stock is a stock in a company that provides essential services such as electricity, water, or natural gas. Utility stocks are often considered defensive because demand for their services is relatively stable.

## Characteristics
- Stable cash flows and dividends.
- Regulation that influences pricing and returns.
- Lower volatility compared to many sectors.

## Example
A regulated electric utility pays a steady dividend and shows lower price swings than the overall market.

## Practical notes
Utility stocks can be sensitive to interest rates because investors compare them to bond like income. Regulatory changes can also affect profitability.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Utility Stock and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Utility Stock as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Utility Stock, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Utility Stock. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Utility Stock alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
