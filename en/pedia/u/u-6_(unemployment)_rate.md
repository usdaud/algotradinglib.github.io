# U-6 (Unemployment) Rate

The U-6 [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) is a comprehensive measure of labor underutilization in the [economy](../e/economy.md), introduced by the Bureau of Labor [Statistics](../s/statistics.md) (BLS) of the United States. Unlike the more commonly known U-3 [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md), which only includes individuals who are actively seeking work and have not yet found any, the U-6 rate provides a broader picture of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) by including various forms of [underemployment](../u/underemployment.md) and marginal attachment to the workforce.

## Components of the U-6 Rate

The U-6 rate encompasses several categories of workers who are often overlooked in the traditional [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) metrics. These categories include:

1. **Officially Unemployed (U-3)**: People without jobs who are actively seeking employment and are available to start work. This is the standard that most people think of when discussing [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates.

2. **Marginally Attached Workers**: Individuals who are not currently working or looking for work but have shown some degree of [interest](../i/interest.md) in working in the recent past—specifically, they have looked for work within the last 12 months but not in the past four weeks. This group includes:
 - **Discouraged Workers**: Those who are not searching for work because they believe no jobs are available for them or that there are no jobs for which they would qualify.

3. **Involuntary Part-Time Workers**: Workers who are employed part-time (less than 35 hours per week) but desire and are available for full-time work. These individuals are also known as "part-time for economic reasons," as their [underemployment](../u/underemployment.md) is typically due to unfavorable [business](../b/business.md) conditions or the inability to find full-time work.

4. **Underutilized Workers**: Those who are employed in positions that do not fully utilize their skills, qualifications, or experience. This category is not explicitly measured in the U-6, but understanding it is necessary for comprehensive [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) analysis.

## Calculation of U-6

The U-6 rate is calculated using the following formula:

\[ U-6 = \frac{(U + MA + IPT)}{L + MA} \]

where:
- **U**: Number of officially unemployed persons.
- **MA**: Number of marginally attached workers.
- **IPT**: Number of involuntary part-time workers.
- **L**: Size of the labor force (employed + officially unemployed).

Understanding this equation is critical for accurately interpreting the labor [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

## Importance of U-6 Rate

### Broad Insight into Labor Market Health:
The U-6 rate offers a broader perspective on [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) health by encompassing a wider [range](../r/range.md) of challenges faced by the workforce. This can be particularly important in times of economic distress or recovery, where traditional [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates might not capture the true extent of [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) difficulties.

### Policy Implications:
For policymakers, the U-6 rate can indicate the efficacy of current economic policies or the need for additional interventions. By recognizing the nuanced aspects of [underemployment](../u/underemployment.md) and marginal attachment, policies can be more effectively targeted to address specific issues within the [labor market](../l/labor_market.md).

### Business and Investment Strategies:
Investors and businesses can use the U-6 rate to make informed decisions. For example, a high U-6 rate may signal weak consumer spending power, influencing investment strategies and [business](../b/business.md) plans. Similarly, it can also impact wage negotiations and human resource strategies within companies.

### Economic Comparisons:
The U-6 rate allows for more thorough comparisons across different economic contexts and time periods. By understanding not just raw [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) numbers but also the broader [underemployment](../u/underemployment.md) trends, economists and analysts can better gauge the success of macroeconomic policies across different eras or regions.

## Historical Trends and Analysis

Historically, the U-6 rate tends to follow the same overall trends as the U-3 rate but at a higher level. For example, during the [Great Recession](../g/great_recession.md) of 2007-2009, the U-3 rate peaked at around 10%, whereas the U-6 rate reached nearly 18%. This disparity highlights the added dimension of [underemployment](../u/underemployment.md) that the U-6 captures.

### Recent Data

For the latest [statistics](../s/statistics.md) and historical data on the U-6 [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md), you can refer to the Bureau of Labor [Statistics](../s/statistics.md)’ public materials on alternative measures of labor underutilization:


## Criticisms and Limitations

While the U-6 rate provides a more comprehensive measure of [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) health, it is not without its criticisms and limitations:

### Overinclusiveness:
Some argue that the U-6 rate might overstate [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) challenges by including those marginally attached to the workforce who may not be seriously seeking employment.

### Market Dynamics:
The inclusion of involuntary part-time workers can skew the perception of [underemployment](../u/underemployment.md), especially in industries where part-time work is prevalent either by choice or by the nature of the [industry](../i/industry.md).

### Lack of Structural Insight:
The U-6 rate does not differentiate between the various causes of [underemployment](../u/underemployment.md), such as skill mismatches or geographic barriers, which are vital for tailored economic interventions.

### Comparability Across Countries:
International [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) comparisons using the U-6 rate are challenging due to differing definitions and methodologies for measuring [underemployment](../u/underemployment.md) and marginal attachment.

## Conclusion

The U-6 rate is a vital tool for gaining a comprehensive understanding of [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) health, far beyond what the traditional U-3 [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md). By including marginally attached workers and those employed part-time for economic reasons, it paints a fuller picture of the employment landscape. While it has its criticisms and limitations, the U-6 rate remains a critical metric for policymakers, businesses, investors, and economists striving to navigate and understand [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) complexities.
