# Unfilled Order Management

## Introduction to Unfilled Order Management

Unfilled [order management](../o/order_management_in_trading.md) is a critical aspect of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), specifically intended to deal with situations where trading orders are not executed. In the dynamic and fast-paced environment of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), it's common for certain orders, either buy or sell, to remain unfilled due to various reasons such as [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), [order](../o/order.md) size, price restrictions, etc. Efficiently managing these [unfilled orders](../u/unfilled_orders.md) can significantly impact a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md)â€™s performance, profitability, and [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure. This topic delves into the mechanisms, strategies, and systems used in handling [unfilled orders](../u/unfilled_orders.md) within [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

## Causes of Unfilled Orders

### Market Conditions

[Market](../m/market.md) conditions greatly influence whether an [order](../o/order.md) gets filled or remains unfilled. High [volatility](../v/volatility.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues, and [market depth](../m/market_depth.md) are primary factors affecting [order](../o/order.md) fulfillment.

1. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: High [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can cause rapid price changes, making it difficult for orders to be matched at the desired prices.
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Low [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [market](../m/market.md) implies fewer participants, which can lead to orders remaining unfilled due to a lack of counterparties.
3. **[Market Depth](../m/market_depth.md)**: Thin [market depth](../m/market_depth.md) means there are limited buy and sell orders at various price levels, making it challenging for large orders to be filled.

### Order Attributes

Characteristics of the [order](../o/order.md) itself can be a reason for it remaining unfilled.

- **[Order](../o/order.md) Size**: Extremely large orders may not find immediate counter-orders to match, causing them to stay unfilled.
- **Price Limits**: Limit orders set with specific price targets may not be executed if the [market](../m/market.md) doesn't reach those price points.
- **Time Constraints**: Orders with strict time limits, such as Immediate or Cancel (IOC) orders, may expire unfilled if they cannot be executed promptly.

## Strategies for Unfilled Order Management

### Order Splitting

[Order](../o/order.md) splitting involves breaking down large orders into smaller chunks to facilitate better [execution](../e/execution.md) and minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact. 

- **[Algorithmic Execution](../a/algorithmic_execution.md) Algorithms**: Strategies like VWAP ([Volume](../v/volume.md) [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price) and TWAP (Time [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price) spread out orders over time to achieve optimal [execution](../e/execution.md) prices.
- **Iceberg Orders**: These are large orders divided into smaller disclosed amounts that help reduce [market](../m/market.md) impact and disguise the true [order](../o/order.md) size.

### Order Cancellation and Replacement

If orders remain unfilled, traders can opt to cancel and replace them.

- **Dynamic Re-Pricing**: Adjusting the price limits of the unfilled [order](../o/order.md) in response to current [market](../m/market.md) movements.
- **Re-Issuing Orders**: Cancelling [unfilled orders](../u/unfilled_orders.md) and issuing new ones with adjusted parameters or different [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md).

### Dark Pools and Alternative Trading Systems (ATS)

Utilizing non-public trading venues can increase the likelihood of [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) without affecting [market](../m/market.md) prices.

- **[Dark Pools](../d/dark_pools.md)**: Private exchanges where large orders can be executed away from the public [market](../m/market.md) to avoid price movements.
- **ATS**: Other Alternative [Trading Systems](../t/trading_systems.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) diverse mechanisms for [matching orders](../m/matching_orders.md) without exposing them to public [market](../m/market.md) risks.

### Smart Order Routing (SOR)

Smart [Order Routing](../o/order_routing.md) technology intelligently directs orders across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) trading venues to find the best [execution](../e/execution.md) path.

- **Optimal Route Selection**: SOR systems analyze various factors including price, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and probability of [execution](../e/execution.md) to choose the best venue for [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md).
- **Cross-Venue Matching**: Orders are quickly matched across different exchanges and [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md), increasing the chances of fulfillment.

## Technologies and Systems for Unfilled Order Management

### Real-Time Market Data Analytics

Advanced real-time [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) systems are crucial for monitoring [market](../m/market.md) conditions and adjusting orders accordingly.

- **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) Models**: These models predict [market](../m/market.md) trends and suggest optimal [order](../o/order.md) replacement strategies based on historical data.
- **Streaming Data Processing**: Real-time processing frameworks like Apache Kafka and Flink monitor attribute changes in the [market](../m/market.md) continuously.

### Order Management Systems (OMS)

[Order Management Systems](../o/order_management_systems.md) help in tracking, managing, and optimizing the [life cycle](../l/life_cycle.md) of trading orders.

- **[Order](../o/order.md) Lifecycle Monitoring**: OMS platforms record and manage the status of orders from initiation to [execution](../e/execution.md) or cancellation.
- **Automated Adjustments**: OMS can autonomously adjust [unfilled orders](../u/unfilled_orders.md) based on predefined criteria and algorithms.

### Integration with Execution Management Systems (EMS)

OMS integrated with EMS provides additional layers of functionality for [order](../o/order.md) handling.

- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Support**: EMS can [handle](../h/handle.md) high-frequency data and [execution](../e/execution.md) requirements, crucial for algo [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
- **[Execution Algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md)**: Advanced [execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md) within EMS adjust orders dynamically to optimize [execution](../e/execution.md).

## Risk Management in Unfilled Orders

### Exposure Management

[Unfilled orders](../u/unfilled_orders.md) pose significant exposure risks as intended [market](../m/market.md) positions might not be achieved.

- **[Hedging Strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md)**: Employing [hedge](../h/hedge.md) positions to protect against adverse [market](../m/market.md) movements if primary orders remain unfilled.
- **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to limit potential losses due to unfilled buy or sell orders.

### Compliance and Regulation

Ensuring that the management of [unfilled orders](../u/unfilled_orders.md) adheres to regulatory standards is crucial.

- **Regulation Compliance**: Systems should ensure all modifications, cancellations, and re-issuances comply with regulatory guidelines.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintaining comprehensive logs of all [order management](../o/order_management_in_trading.md) activities for regulatory audits and investigations.
