# Unlevered Cost of Capital

The unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), often denoted as \( r_U \), represents the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) for a company without any [debt](../d/debt.md). It is the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) as if the company operated with purely [equity financing](../e/equity_financing.md), excluding the [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) introduced by [leverage](../l/leverage.md) ([debt](../d/debt.md)). This measure reflects the [inherent risk](../i/inherent_risk.md) in the company's core operations, independent of its [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md).

Understanding and calculating the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) is crucial for several reasons, including corporate [valuation](../v/valuation.md), investment decision-making, and [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) [optimization](../o/optimization.md). This document [will](../w/will.md) cover various aspects related to the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), including its theoretical foundation, the difference between levered and unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), methods of calculation, and applications in [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading.

## Theoretical Foundation

The concept of the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) is deeply rooted in modern financial theory, particularly in the context of the Modigliani-Miller (M&M) theorem. Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, in their seminal works during the 1950s and 1960s, fundamentally changed the way we understand [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) and its impact on a [firm](../f/firm.md)’s [value](../v/value.md).

### Modigliani-Miller Theorem

The M&M theorem posits that, under certain conditions (such as no [taxes](../t/taxes.md), [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) costs, [agency costs](../a/agency_costs.md), and [asymmetric information](../a/asymmetric_information.md), as well as efficient markets), the [value](../v/value.md) of a [firm](../f/firm.md) is independent of its [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md). This forms the [basis](../b/basis.md) for understanding the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md):

\[ V_U = V_L \]

where \( V_U \) is the [value](../v/value.md) of the unlevered [firm](../f/firm.md), and \( V_L \) is the [value](../v/value.md) of the levered [firm](../f/firm.md).

When there are no [taxes](../t/taxes.md), the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) equals the required [return on assets](../r/return_on_assets_(roa).md), which is a [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) assuming no [debt](../d/debt.md):

\[ r_U = \text{[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) [Cost of Capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) without [Debt](../d/debt.md)} \]

### Adjustments for Taxes

In reality, firms often benefit from tax shields due to [interest](../i/interest.md) deductibility, which impacts the effective [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md). The adjusted formulas include tax benefits:

\[ V_L = V_U + T \times D \]

where \( T \) is the [corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rate, and \( D \) is the amount of [debt](../d/debt.md).

Thus, when considering [taxes](../t/taxes.md), the relationship is adjusted to account for these tax shields.

## Differences Between Levered and Unlevered Cost of Capital

### Levered Cost of Capital

The levered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) (\( r_L \)) reflects the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) for a [firm](../f/firm.md) that finances its operations through a mix of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). This measure accounts for the [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) introduced by [debt](../d/debt.md), which often leads to a higher [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) due to the increased [risk](../r/risk.md) borne by [equity](../e/equity.md) investors.

### Unlevered Cost of Capital

On the other hand, the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) (\( r_U \)) reflects the cost as if the [firm](../f/firm.md) had no [debt](../d/debt.md). It essentially calculates the [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) assuming a 100% [equity](../e/equity.md)-financed [firm](../f/firm.md). This removes the financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and is solely based on the operating [risk](../r/risk.md) of the assets.

\[ r_U = \frac{E}{V}(r_E) + \frac{D}{V}(r_D)(1-T) \]

where \( E \) is [equity](../e/equity.md), \( V \) is the unlevered [firm](../f/firm.md) [value](../v/value.md) (E+D), \( r_E \) is the [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md), \( r_D \) is the [cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md), and \( T \) is the [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md).

## Calculation Methods

### Pure Play Approach

One common method to estimate the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) is through the [pure play](../p/pure_play.md) approach. This involves finding comparable companies (pure plays) that are entirely [equity](../e/equity.md)-financed and operating in the same [industry](../i/industry.md).

\[ r_U = \text{Pure Play Comparable [Cost of Equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md)} \]

For instance, if a [firm](../f/firm.md) is in the [technology sector](../t/technology_sector.md), the [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) of a purely [equity](../e/equity.md)-financed tech company can be used as a [proxy](../p/proxy.md) for the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md).

### Asset Beta (Unlevered Beta)

Another approach involves using the [unlevered beta](../u/unlevered_beta.md) (\( \beta_U \)), which represents the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) without the influence of [debt](../d/debt.md). This can be derived from the levered [beta](../b/beta.md) (\( \beta_L \)) via the following formula:

\[ \beta_U = \frac{\beta_L}{1 + (1 - T) \frac{D}{E}} \]

The unlevered [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) can then be obtained using the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM):

\[ r_U = r_f + \beta_U (r_m - r_f) \]

where \( r_f \) represents the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate, and \( r_m \) is the expected [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md).

### Bond Yield Plus Risk Premium Approach

In certain cases, especially for firms without comparable [pure play](../p/pure_play.md) companies, a [bond yield](../b/bond_yield.md) plus [risk premium](../r/risk_premium.md) approach could be used. This method involves adding a [risk premium](../r/risk_premium.md) to the company's existing [bond yield](../b/bond_yield.md) to estimate the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md).

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) Approach

Another comprehensive method is through the WACC, unadjusted for the effect of [debt](../d/debt.md). Calculating the [firm](../f/firm.md)’s WACC using only its [equity](../e/equity.md) and unlevered [equity](../e/equity.md) [beta](../b/beta.md) gives us the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md):

\[ r_U = WACC_{\text{assuming no [debt](../d/debt.md)}} \]

### Example Calculation

Let's consider a hypothetical company, XYZ Corp., with the following data:
- [Market value of equity](../m/market_value_of_equity.md) (\( E \)): $500 million
- [Market value](../m/market_value.md) of [debt](../d/debt.md) (\( D \)): $200 million
- [Cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) (\( r_E \)): 10%
- [Cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md) (\( r_D \)): 5%
- [Corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rate (\( T \)): 30%

Using the WACC formula and adjusting for [leverage](../l/leverage.md), we can calculate \( r_U \):

\[ WACC = \left( \frac{E}{V} \times r_E \right) + \left( \frac{D}{V} \times r_D \times (1 - T) \) \]

\[ WACC = \left( \frac{500}{700} \times 0.10 \right) + \left( \frac{200}{700} \times 0.05 \times (1 - 0.30) \right) \]

\[ WACC = 0.0714 + 0.0071 \]

\[ WACC = 0.0785 \text{ or } 7.85\% \]

Next, derive the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) \( r_U \):

\[ r_U = r_E \left[1 + (1 - T) \frac{D}{E}\right] \]

\[ r_U = 0.10 \left[1 + (1 - 0.30) \frac{200}{500}\right] \]

\[ r_U = 0.10 \left[1 + 0.70 \times 0.40\right] \]

\[ r_U = 0.10 \left[1 + 0.28\right] \]

\[ r_U = 0.10 \times 1.28 \]

\[ r_U = 0.128 \text{ or } 12.8\% \]

Thus, the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) for XYZ Corp. is 12.8%.

## Practical Applications

### Corporate Finance

In [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) is instrumental in the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of investment projects and firms. When performing a Discounted [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (DCF) analysis, the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) is utilized to [discount](../d/discount.md) the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) to the [firm](../f/firm.md) (FCFF). This helps in assessing the [value](../v/value.md) independent of [debt](../d/debt.md) levels, ensuring that the investment or [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) decision is based on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [business](../b/business.md) performance rather than its [financing](../f/financing.md).

### Capital Structure Optimization

For firms looking to optimize their [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md), understanding the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) helps identify the proportion of [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) that minimizes the overall [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md). By analyzing the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), firms can make informed decisions on whether to increase or decrease [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to achieve the optimal balance that maximizes [firm](../f/firm.md) [value](../v/value.md).

### Risk Management

In [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), knowing the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) aids in benchmarking operational performance against [industry](../i/industry.md) standards. This allows firms to isolate the impact of [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) ([leverage](../l/leverage.md)) from their [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md), leading to better strategic planning and [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation practices.

### Trading and Investment Strategies

For traders and investors, the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) provides deeper insights into the true [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) of firms, excluding the [noise](../n/noise.md) introduced by different [capital](../c/capital.md) structures. This aids in making more accurate comparative assessments between firms in the same [industry](../i/industry.md), leading to more informed trading and investment decisions.

### Fintech and Algorithmic Trading

In the realm of fintech and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) can be incorporated into sophisticated [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) to enhance decision-making. For instance, algorithms can utilize the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) to filter out firms with high [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md) and lower [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md), leading to more [robust](../r/robust.md) and profitable [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

Moreover, fintech platforms often provide tools and analytics that help investors calculate and interpret the unlevered [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), thereby democratizing access to advanced financial insights and leveling the playing field for retail and institutional investors alike.
