## Overview

Upbit quickly ascended the ranks in the cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) landscape due to its user-friendly interface, [robust](../r/robust.md) [security](../s/security.md) measures, and strategic partnerships.

## Founding and Background

Upbit was founded by Dunamu Inc., which was established in 2012.

Upon recognizing the emergent trends and the growing [demand](../d/demand.md) for cryptocurrency trading in South Korea, Dunamu stepped into the crypto [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [industry](../i/industry.md) by launching Upbit.

One notable strategic partnership that bolstered Upbit's credibility is its collaboration with Bittrex, a popular U.S.-based cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
