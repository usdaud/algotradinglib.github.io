# Unsubscribed

## Definition
**Unsubscribed** refers to the portion of a [new issue](../n/new_issue.md) of securities, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds, that has not been purchased by investors during an [offering](../o/offering.md) period. This can occur in various types of offerings, including initial public offerings (IPOs) or follow-on offerings, where the [demand](../d/demand.md) for the securities does not meet the [supply](../s/supply.md).

## Key Components
1. **Securities [Offering](../o/offering.md)**: The process by which companies [issue](../i/issue.md) new [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) from investors.
2. **Subscription Period**: The time frame during which investors can purchase the offered securities.
3. **Underwriters**: Financial institutions that help manage the [offering](../o/offering.md) process, including [marketing](../m/marketing.md) the securities to potential investors.
4. **[Demand](../d/demand.md)**: The level of [interest](../i/interest.md) from investors in purchasing the offered securities.

## Importance
1. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Raising**: The goal of a securities [offering](../o/offering.md) is to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) for the issuing company. Unsubscribed portions indicate a [shortfall](../s/shortfall.md) in this goal.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Perception**: A high level of unsubscribed securities can signal weak [demand](../d/demand.md) or lack of confidence in the issuing company, potentially affecting its [market](../m/market.md) perception and stock price.
3. **[Underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Underwriters may need to purchase any unsubscribed securities themselves, increasing their [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md).

## Example Scenarios
1. **Initial Public [Offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO)**: A company launches an IPO to sell 1 million [shares](../s/shares.md) but only 800,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) are subscribed by investors. The remaining 200,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) are unsubscribed.
2. **[Bond](../b/bond.md) [Offering](../o/offering.md)**: A [corporation](../c/corporation.md) issues $500 million in bonds, but investors only purchase $450 million worth of bonds, leaving $50 million unsubscribed.
3. **Rights [Issue](../i/issue.md)**: An existing company offers new [shares](../s/shares.md) to current shareholders at a discounted price. If shareholders do not fully subscribe to the offered [shares](../s/shares.md), the remaining [shares](../s/shares.md) are unsubscribed.

## Challenges
1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Adverse [market](../m/market.md) conditions or [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment can lead to higher levels of unsubscribed securities.
2. **Pricing**: If the [offering price](../o/offering_price.md) is perceived as too high, investors may be reluctant to purchase, resulting in unsubscribed portions.
3. **Company Perception**: Negative perceptions about the issuing company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) or future prospects can reduce [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md).

## Best Practices
1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Analysis**: Conduct thorough [market](../m/market.md) analysis to set an appropriate [offering price](../o/offering_price.md) that aligns with [investor](../i/investor.md) expectations.
2. **Effective Communication**: Clearly communicate the company's [value proposition](../v/value_proposition.md) and growth prospects to potential investors.
3. **[Underwriter](../u/underwriter.md) Support**: Work closely with underwriters to gauge [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) and adjust the [offering](../o/offering.md) strategy if necessary.
4. **Incentives**: Consider [offering](../o/offering.md) incentives, such as discounts or bonuses, to encourage [investor](../i/investor.md) participation.

## Conclusion
Unsubscribed portions of a securities [offering](../o/offering.md) indicate that the [demand](../d/demand.md) from investors did not meet the [supply](../s/supply.md) of the offered securities. This can impact the issuing company's ability to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and affect [market](../m/market.md) perception. Understanding the key components, importance, and challenges of unsubscribed securities can help companies and underwriters effectively manage offerings and mitigate risks associated with weak [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md).

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Unsubscribed and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Unsubscribed as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.
