# Underinsured Motorist Coverage

Underinsured Motorist Coverage (UIM) is a type of auto [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy designed to protect drivers if they are involved in an accident with a motorist who does not carry sufficient [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage to pay for the total amount of damages caused. This coverage is particularly crucial in scenarios where the policyholder's losses surpass the at-fault driver's [liability](../l/liability.md) limits. UIM coverage complements other forms of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) and provides an additional layer of financial [security](../s/security.md).

## Scope and Importance

Underinsured Motorist Coverage steps in when the at-fault driver’s [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is insufficient. For example, if you are in an accident, and the at-fault driver's [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy has a cap that does not cover all your medical bills or repair costs, UIM coverage can bridge the gap. This kind of coverage is essential for several reasons:

1. **Medical Expenses**: It helps cover medical bills, including hospital stays, rehabilitation, and ongoing treatment.
2. **Lost Wages**: If the policyholder is unable to work because of the accident, this coverage can help compensate for lost [income](../i/income.md).
3. **Pain and Suffering**: In some cases, UIM can cover non-economic damages such as pain and suffering.
4. **Property Damage**: Some policies also extend to cover vehicle repair costs and other property damages.

## Types and Variations

### 1. Bodily Injury Underinsured Motorist Coverage (UIMBI)

UIMBI covers medical expenses and lost wages for the policyholder and their passengers. It may also cover pain and suffering. This type of coverage activates when the at-fault driver’s bodily injury [liability](../l/liability.md) limits are lower than the total medical costs incurred by the insured party.

### 2. Property Damage Underinsured Motorist Coverage (UIMPD)

Although less common, UIMPD covers the cost of repairs to the policyholder’s vehicle or other property. This is in situations where the at-fault driver's property damage [liability](../l/liability.md) limits are insufficient to cover the repair or replacement costs.

## Legal Requirements and Availability

Not all states in the USA require Underinsured Motorist Coverage, and the requirements and availability can vary significantly. Some states may mandate it, while in others, it is optional. However, even if it is not required by law, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) agents often recommend it as a prudent measure.

For instance:
- **Mandatory States**: Some states require UIM coverage to be included as part of their minimum [insurance](../i/insurance.md) requirements.
- **Optional States**: In states where it is optional, drivers can choose whether or not to add this coverage to their auto [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy.

## Understanding Policy Limits

UIM coverage, like other types of [insurance](../i/insurance.md), comes with its limits, which are detailed in the policy document. These limits are the maximum amounts the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [will](../w/will.md) pay out. Policyholders generally have the option to choose their coverage limits when purchasing a policy.

1. **Per Person**: This limit is the maximum amount payable for one individual in a single accident.
2. **Per Accident**: This limit represents the maximum amount payable for all individuals injured in a single accident.

Example: A policy with $100,000/$300,000 coverage means up to $100,000 is available per person, but no more than $300,000 [will](../w/will.md) be paid for a single accident involving [multiple](../m/multiple.md) injured parties.

## Claims Process

Filing a claim under Underinsured Motorist Coverage involves several steps:

1. **Documentation**: Policyholders need to gather all relevant documents, including accident reports, medical bills, and repair estimates.
2. **Notification**: Inform your [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company about the accident and your intention to file a UIM claim.
3. **Evidence Collection**: Your insurer may require proof that the at-fault driver’s [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is insufficient.
4. **Settlement Process**: The [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company [will](../w/will.md) review your claim and determine the [payout](../p/payout.md) based on your policy terms and the documented expenses.

## Impact on Premiums

Adding UIM coverage can affect the cost of your auto [insurance premium](../i/insurance_premium.md). The impact depends on several factors:

1. **Coverage Limits**: Higher limits usually result in higher premiums.
2. **Driver’s Record**: Your driving history may also influence the cost.
3. **Location**: The [premium](../p/premium.md) cost can vary based on the state or region where you reside.

Despite the potential increase in premiums, many find that the benefits of having UIM coverage outweigh the additional costs, especially in areas with a high incidence of underinsured motorists.

## Conclusion

Underinsured Motorist Coverage is a vital part of a comprehensive auto [insurance](../i/insurance.md) strategy, providing valuable protection against insufficiently insured drivers. While it may not be required in all states, it offers significant financial reassurance for drivers concerned about the potential for substantial [out-of-pocket expenses](../o/out-of-pocket_expenses.md) following an accident.
