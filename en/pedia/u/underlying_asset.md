# Underlying Asset

In the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and investments, the term "[underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md)" is crucial to understanding various financial instruments, including [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), bonds, and [options](../o/options.md). An [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) is a fundamental concept that serves as the [basis](../b/basis.md) without which these financial products would not exist.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## Definition and Importance

- **Definition**: An [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) is a tangible or [intangible asset](../i/intangible_asset.md) upon which a [derivative](../d/derivative.md)'s price is based. It is the fundamental component that dictates the [value](../v/value.md) of the [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contract.

- **Importance**: The price and [value](../v/value.md) of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) like [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), and swaps are directly influenced by the performance and [value](../v/value.md) of their [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. These assets provide the 'foundation' for the price movements in these financial instruments.

## Types of Underlying Assets

[Underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets can be classified into various categories, reflecting the breadth and variety of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). The primary types of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets are:

1. **Equities**: These include [stocks](../s/stock.md) or [shares](../s/shares.md) of companies. For instance, the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) for an [equity](../e/equity.md) option could be the stock of a company like Apple Inc. (

2. **Bonds**: These are fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities issued by corporations or governments. For example, Treasury bonds or corporate bonds serve as [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets for [bond](../b/bond.md) [options](../o/options.md) or [bond futures](../b/bond_futures.md).

3. **Commodities**: These are physical goods such as gold, oil, or agricultural products. [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) often use commodities as their [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

4. **Currencies**: [Foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) markets utilize currencies as [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. [Currency](../c/currency.md) [options](../o/options.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md) are based on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates between two currencies.

5. **[Market](../m/market.md) Indexes**: Indices like the S&P 500 or the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) can be [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets for [index futures](../i/index_futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md).

6. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Financial instruments that base their [value](../v/value.md) on [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes, like [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) or [options](../o/options.md).

7. **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md)**: [Real property](../r/real_property.md) can be an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment trusts (REITs) or [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

## Derivatives and the Underlying Asset

[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial instruments that derive their [value](../v/value.md) from an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md). The connection between the [derivative](../d/derivative.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) is pivotal in determining the characteristics and [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of the [derivative](../d/derivative.md).

### Types of Derivatives Linked to Underlying Assets

1. **[Options](../o/options.md)**: Contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified price before a certain date. The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) could be a stock, [commodity](../c/commodity.md), or [currency](../c/currency.md).

2. **[Futures](../f/futures.md)**: Standardized contracts to buy or sell the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined price at a specific time in the future.

3. **Swaps**: Agreements to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) cash flows or other financial instruments. [Interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) and [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps are common examples where the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) is an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) or [currency exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md) rate.

4. **Forwards**: Customized contracts between two parties to buy or sell the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) at a set price on a future date.

### Valuation Dependence

The [value](../v/value.md) of a [derivative](../d/derivative.md) is intricately tied to the price of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md). For example:

- **Call [Options](../o/options.md)**: The [value](../v/value.md) increases as the price of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) increases.
- **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md)**: The [value](../v/value.md) increases as the price of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) decreases.

The pricing models for [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), such as the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) for [options](../o/options.md), use various factors, including the price of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md), to calculate the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of the [derivative](../d/derivative.md).

## Risks and Considerations

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) involves understanding the risks and behaviors of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md). Key considerations include:

- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) can lead to higher potential returns but also greater [risk](../r/risk.md).

- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: The [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) affects the ease with which [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) can be traded.

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: [Economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), [market](../m/market.md) trends, and geopolitical events can significantly impact the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price.

- **[Correlation](../c/correlation.md)**: The degree to which the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price movement is correlated with other [market](../m/market.md) factors or assets.

## Practical Applications

### Hedging

One of the primary uses of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) is to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against price fluctuations in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md). For example, a farmer may use [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to lock in a price for their produce, thereby mitigating the [risk](../r/risk.md) of price drops.

### Speculation

Traders and investors often use [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to speculate on the future price movements of an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md). This can lead to significant profits but also comes with a high level of [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Arbitrage

Arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies between the [derivative](../d/derivative.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) to make [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits. This requires sophisticated strategies and [market](../m/market.md) knowledge.

### Income Generation

[Options](../o/options.md) strategies, such as covered calls or cash-secured puts, allow investors to generate [income](../i/income.md) by leveraging the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md).

## Real-World Examples

### Equities: Tesla (TSLA)

Tesla's stock serves as the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) for various [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), including stock [options](../o/options.md). Investors can buy call [options](../o/options.md) on TSLA stock if they believe the price [will](../w/will.md) go up or [put options](../p/put_options.md) if they expect it to decline.

### Commodities: Gold

Gold [futures](../f/futures.md) are one of the most traded [commodity](../c/commodity.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md), physical gold, influences the pricing of these [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). Investors and companies engage in gold [futures](../f/futures.md) to speculate or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against future price changes in the gold [market](../m/market.md).

### Currencies: Forex Market

In the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md), [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs like EUR/USD serve as [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets for forex [options](../o/options.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md). Traders use these [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) or to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) movements.

### Interest Rates: LIBOR

[Interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) often use the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as their [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md). These swaps allow parties to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) payments for floating rates, based on LIBOR, to manage [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) exposure.

## Technological Advances: Impact on Underlying Assets

### FinTech Innovations

Financial technology (FinTech) has revolutionized how investors interact with [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). Platforms such as [Robinhood](../r/robinhood.md) ( and [E*TRADE](../e/e_trade.md) ( have democratized access to these markets, providing innovative tools and resources for trading and investment.

### Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo-trading, uses algorithms and automated systems to [trade](../t/trade.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) based on [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. Algorithms can process vast amounts of data and execute trades at high speeds, often capitalizing on minute price discrepancies.

### Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology and the rise of cryptocurrencies like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) have introduced new forms of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. Crypto [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), such as [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [futures](../f/futures.md), are gaining popularity among traders looking for exposure to the cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md).

## Conclusion

Understanding [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets is fundamental to comprehending the broader landscape of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and instruments. Whether one is involved in trading [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) for hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), or [income](../i/income.md) generation, the role of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) cannot be overstated. By grasping the intricacies and dynamics of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets, investors and traders can better navigate the complexities of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and make more informed decisions.
