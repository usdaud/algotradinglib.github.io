# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning is a [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) approach that deals with unlabeled data, seeking to discover inherent patterns or structures within the data.

### Key Components
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering).
- **[Dimensionality Reduction](../d/dimensionality_reduction_in_trading.md):** Techniques such as PCA and t-SNE to simplify data representation.
- **[Anomaly Detection](../a/anomaly_detection.md):** Identifying unusual patterns or outliers.
- **Association:** Discovering relationships between variables (e.g., [market basket analysis](../m/market_basket.md)).

### Applications
- **[Customer](../c/customer.md) Segmentation:** Identifying distinct groups within [customer](../c/customer.md) data.
- **[Anomaly Detection](../a/anomaly_detection.md):** Detecting [fraud](../f/fraud.md) or unusual behavior in systems.
- **[Data Visualization](../d/data_visualization.md):** Reducing data complexity for exploratory analysis.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Uncovering hidden patterns in user behavior.

### Advantages
- No need for labeled data, which can be costly to obtain.
- Can reveal hidden structures and insights within data.
- Useful for exploratory data analysis.

### Challenges
- Evaluation metrics can be less clear without labels.
- [Risk](../r/risk.md) of identifying patterns that are not meaningful.
- Results can be sensitive to algorithm parameters and initial conditions.

### Future Outlook
Developments in unsupervised learning are expected to enhance its robustness and integration with supervised methods, fostering breakthroughs in areas like [self-supervised learning](../s/self-supervised_learning.md) and generative modeling.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Unsupervised Learning and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Unsupervised Learning as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Unsupervised Learning, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Unsupervised Learning. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Unsupervised Learning alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
