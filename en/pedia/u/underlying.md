# Underlying

In the context of trading and [finance](../f/finance.md), the term "underlying" refers to the fundamental [asset](../a/asset.md) upon which a [derivative](../d/derivative.md)'s price is based. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial instruments whose [value](../v/value.md) is derived from the [value](../v/value.md) of another [asset](../a/asset.md), known as the "[underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)." Examples of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) include [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), swaps, and other similar financial instruments. The [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) can be a stock, [bond](../b/bond.md), [commodity](../c/commodity.md), [currency](../c/currency.md), [index](../i/index_instrument.md), or even an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).

The concept of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is crucial for understanding how [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) work and are priced. The performance or price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) directly impact the [value](../v/value.md) of the [derivative](../d/derivative.md). For example, if you [hold](../h/hold.md) an option contract, the [value](../v/value.md) of that option [will](../w/will.md) fluctuate based on the price movements of the stock that underlies the option.

## Types of Underlying Assets

### 1. Stocks
[Stocks](../s/stock.md) are one of the most common underlying assets for [options](../o/options.md) and other [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md). An option on a stock gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the stock at a predetermined price within a specified period. The stock itself serves as the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### 2. Bonds
Bonds can also serve as underlying assets in the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md). For instance, a [bond](../b/bond.md) option gives the holder the right to buy or sell a specific [bond](../b/bond.md) at a certain price before a specified date.

### 3. Commodities
Commodities such as gold, oil, and agricultural products frequently serve as underlying assets for [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). In a [commodity futures contract](../c/commodity_futures_contract.md), one party agrees to buy, and the other agrees to sell, the underlying [commodity](../c/commodity.md) at a future date for a price fixed today.

### 4. Currencies
[Foreign exchange derivatives](../f/foreign_exchange_derivatives.md) include [options](../o/options.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md) based on [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs like the EUR/USD or JPY/USD. These [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs are the underlying assets, and their price movements [will](../w/will.md) affect the [value](../v/value.md) of the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

### 5. Indices
A variety of financial indices serve as underlying assets for [index options](../i/index_options.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md). For example, the S&P 500 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) is a widely used [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) for [options](../o/options.md) and [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). These [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) allow traders to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the overall performance of the [market](../m/market.md) rather than individual [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### 6. Interest Rates
[Interest rate derivatives](../i/interest_rate_derivatives.md), such as swaps and [options](../o/options.md), are based on underlying assets like [government bond](../g/government_bond.md) yields or LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). These instruments are used to manage exposure to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations.

## Importance of Underlying Assets

### Price Determination
The price of a [derivative](../d/derivative.md) is fundamentally tied to the price of its [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Understanding the behavior and price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is crucial for pricing and trading [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) effectively.

### Risk Management
Underlying assets play a significant role in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies. Traders and investors use [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against the price movements of underlying assets. For example, an airline company might use oil [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of fuel prices, ensuring more stable [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md).

### Arbitrage Opportunities
Differences in the pricing of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and their underlying assets can lead to [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md). Traders who identify these mismatches can execute strategies to lock in [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits.

### Speculation
[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) provide a means for speculators to bet on the future direction of the prices of underlying assets. By trading [options](../o/options.md) or [futures](../f/futures.md), speculators can potentially earn significant returns if they correctly predict the price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## Examples of Underlying in Practice

### Equity Options
Suppose you are interested in buying a [call option](../c/call_option.md) on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. In this case, Appleâ€™s stock is the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). If Apple's stock price increases, the [value](../v/value.md) of your [call option](../c/call_option.md) [will](../w/will.md) likely increase as well, allowing you to benefit from the upward price movement of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Commodity Futures
Imagine you are a farmer who wants to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of falling wheat prices. You decide to sell wheat [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). Here, wheat serves as the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). By locking in a future selling price today, you can protect yourself against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of price declines in the actual wheat [market](../m/market.md).

### Forex Options
If you believe the [Euro](../e/euro.md) (EUR) [will](../w/will.md) strengthen against the US Dollar (USD), you might buy a EUR/USD [call option](../c/call_option.md). The EUR/USD [currency](../c/currency.md) pair is the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) in this case. If the EUR appreciates relative to USD, the [value](../v/value.md) of your [call option](../c/call_option.md) [will](../w/will.md) likely rise.

### Interest Rate Swaps
A [corporation](../c/corporation.md) that has issued [debt](../d/debt.md) at a [variable interest rate](../v/variable_interest_rate.md) but prefers fixed-rate payments might enter into an [interest rate swap](../i/interest_rate_swap.md). The [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) could be the [LIBOR rate](../l/libor_rate_analysis.md). In the [swap](../s/swap.md) agreement, the company would agree to pay a fixed rate while receiving a variable rate based on LIBOR, thus converting its floating-rate [debt](../d/debt.md) into fixed-rate [debt](../d/debt.md).

## Key Considerations

### Volatility
The [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is a critical [factor](../f/factor.md) in [derivative](../d/derivative.md) pricing, especially for [options](../o/options.md). Higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) generally leads to higher option premiums because the likelihood of significant price movements increases the potential for [profit](../p/profit.md).

### Liquidity
The [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) affects the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of the [derivative](../d/derivative.md). Highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) underlying assets usually result in more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) and tighter-spread [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets, making it easier and less costly for traders to enter and exit positions.

### Correlation
Understanding the [correlation](../c/correlation.md) between the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and other [market](../m/market.md) factors can enhance [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). For example, commodities often have different correlations with [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) than equities, which can be advantageous in creating diversified portfolios.

### Expiration Dates
[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) have expiry dates, while underlying assets like [stocks](../s/stock.md) and commodities do not. The time remaining until expiration can significantly impact the [value](../v/value.md) of a [derivative](../d/derivative.md). [Options](../o/options.md), for instance, lose [value](../v/value.md) as they approach their expiry date, a phenomenon known as [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).

### Dividends and Corporate Actions
For [equity derivatives](../e/equity_derivatives.md), corporate actions such as dividends, stock splits, and mergers can impact the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. These actions need to be considered when trading [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) based on individual [stocks](../s/stock.md).

## Underlying in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algo trading, involves using computer algorithms to execute trades at high speed and [volume](../v/volume.md). In this domain, understanding the behavior of underlying assets is paramount for developing [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). 

### Data Analysis
Algo traders often use historical data of the underlying assets to backtest their models. This involves analyzing past price movements to predict future behavior and optimize [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

### Strategies
Various algo [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) are built around underlying assets:
- **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Based on the idea that the price of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) revert to its mean or average level.
- **[Momentum](../m/momentum.md)**: Looks for trends in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price and trades in the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Exploits price differences between similar or related underlying assets.

### Machine Learning
[Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) techniques can be applied to predict the price movements of underlying assets. Algorithms like [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md), [decision trees](../d/decision_trees.md), and [support vector machines](../s/support_vector_machines_in_trading.md) analyze complex patterns in the data, providing insights that can be used for trading decisions.

### Risk Management
[Automated risk management](../a/automated_risk_management.md) tools can be programmed to monitor the underlying assets and adjust positions in real-time based on predefined [risk](../r/risk.md) parameters. For example, a sudden drop in an underlying stock's price might trigger the algorithm to sell related [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to mitigate losses.

## Fintech Innovations

Fintech companies are leveraging technology to simplify and democratize access to [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), including [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and their underlying assets. Innovations in this space include:

### Trading Platforms
Fintech firms are creating intuitive trading platforms that provide access to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of underlying assets and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). These platforms often [offer](../o/offer.md) advanced charting tools, [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) capabilities, and real-time data feeds.

For example:
- **[Robinhood](../r/robinhood.md)**: A [commission](../c/commission.md)-free [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) that offers access to [stocks](../s/stock.md), [options](../o/options.md), and cryptocurrencies. Visit: [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com)

### Robo-Advisors
Robo-advisors use algorithms to manage investment portfolios, often including [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and their underlying assets as part of an overall strategy designed to achieve specific financial goals.

### Blockchain and Smart Contracts
[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology is being used to develop [decentralized trading platforms](../d/decentralized_trading_platforms.md) that [offer](../o/offer.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reduced [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md). [Smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) can automate the settlement of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) based on the performance of underlying assets.

### Big Data and Analytics
Fintech companies employ [big data analytics](../b/big_data_analytics_in_trading.md) to gather and process vast amounts of information on underlying assets. This data is used to generate actionable insights, enhance [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), and improve [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

In conclusion, the concept of "underlying" is foundational in understanding the mechanics of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) in the trading and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Whether it is [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, currencies, or other financial instruments, the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s behavior is crucial for pricing, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and effective [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Innovations in technology and fintech are continually transforming how traders interact with these underlying assets, making the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) more accessible and efficient.
