# Unbanked

The term "unbanked" refers to individuals or populations who do not have access to traditional financial services offered by banks. This can include lack of access to savings accounts, checking accounts, loans, [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, and other financial services. Unbanked individuals often rely on alternative financial services such as payday lenders, [check](../c/check.md)-cashing outlets, and other nontraditional banking [options](../o/options.md). This situation is especially prevalent in developing countries, but it also affects significant portions of the population in developed nations.

## Extent of the Unbanked Population

Globally, the unbanked population is significant. According to the [World Bank](../w/world_bank.md) Global Findex database, around 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked as of the last survey. The reasons for being unbanked vary from lack of [trust](../t/trust.md) in financial institutions, high fees, geographical barriers, to lack of required documentation.

### Geographical Distribution

Unbanked populations are not evenly distributed. The largest numbers of unbanked individuals can be found in developing regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of Latin America. For example, in Ethiopia, 65% of adults are unbanked, while in India and Nigeria, the figures are 20% and 37%, respectively.

### Demographic Factors

Certain demographic groups are more likely to be unbanked. These include:

- Low-[income](../i/income.md) households
- Rural populations
- Older adults
- Women, especially in certain cultural contexts

### Root Causes

The reasons why people remain unbanked can include:

- **Economic Factors:** High fees, minimum balance requirements, and unpredictable charges deter low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals.
- **Geographical Barriers:** Lack of physical [bank](../b/bank.md) branches in remote or rural areas.
- **Educational Barriers:** Limited [financial literacy](../f/financial_literacy.md) inhibits interaction with formal banking services.
- **Documentation Requirements:** Stringent KYC (Know Your [Customer](../c/customer.md)) requirements which unbanked individuals often cannot fulfill.
- **[Trust](../t/trust.md) Issues:** Distrust of financial institutions may stem from past experiences, systemic corruption, or cultural beliefs.

## Consequences of Being Unbanked

Being unbanked can have wide-ranging negative effects on individuals and communities:

- **Limited Financial [Security](../s/security.md):** Without access to savings accounts, individuals may find it challenging to save [money](../m/money.md) securely.
- **Higher Costs for Financial Services:** Alternative financial services can be more expensive. For instance, payday loans often come with exorbitant [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- **Limited Economic Mobility:** Access to [credit](../c/credit.md) is often necessary for educational opportunities, [home](../h/home.md) ownership, and [business](../b/business.md) ventures.
- **Exclusion from Digital Economies:** Online services, transactions, and e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) become inaccessible without [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts or digital financial means.

## Financial Inclusion Efforts

[Multiple](../m/multiple.md) initiatives aim to reduce the unbanked population by extending financial services to underserved communities. This [financial inclusion](../f/financial_inclusion.md) can stimulate [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), reduce [poverty](../p/poverty.md), and improve the [quality of life](../q/quality_of_life.md).

### Traditional Approaches

- **[Microfinance](../m/microfinance.md):** Small loans offered to individuals or businesses in developing economies. Institutions like Grameen [Bank](../b/bank.md) in Bangladesh have pioneered this model.
- **[Mobile Banking](../m/mobile_banking.md):** Many countries have seen success with [mobile banking](../m/mobile_banking.md) solutions. [M-Pesa](../m/m-pesa.md) in Kenya is a notable example where people can perform transactions using mobile phones.
- **Government Programs:** Some governments distribute social [welfare](../w/welfare.md) payments directly into [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts to encourage banking usage.

### Fintech Solutions

Fintech companies are at the forefront of providing innovative solutions to the unbanked [issue](../i/issue.md). By leveraging technology, these companies aim to [offer](../o/offer.md) accessible, affordable, and trustworthy financial services.

- **Digital Wallets:** Companies such as [PayPal](../p/paypal.md), Google Wallet, and Apple Pay [offer](../o/offer.md) digital wallets that can be used for transactions without a traditional [bank](../b/bank.md) account.
- **Cryptocurrencies and [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md):** Solutions like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) propose an alternative financial ecosystem where banking intermediaries are irrelevant.
- **Neobanks:** Digital-only banks like Chime, Revolut, and Monzo provide banking services through mobile apps, often with fewer fees and more flexibility.

#### Grameen Bank

Founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, Grameen [Bank](../b/bank.md) offers microloans to the impoverished without requiring [collateral](../c/collateral.md).

## Conclusion

The unbanked population poses a significant challenge but also offers a substantial opportunity for financial innovation. Traditional and fintech solutions are making strides to include these individuals in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), enabling [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and improved [quality of life](../q/quality_of_life.md). The journey to [financial inclusion](../f/financial_inclusion.md) is ongoing, and continuous efforts are essential to reach the goal of universal access to financial services.
