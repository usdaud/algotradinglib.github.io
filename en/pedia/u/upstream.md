# Upstream

The term "upstream" in the context of the oil and gas [industry](../i/industry.md) refers to the exploration and production phases of the sector. This segment is primarily concerned with the search for [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) and natural gas fields, the drilling of exploratory wells, and the extraction of oil and gas from underground reservoirs. It is a critical component of the oil and gas [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md), and this article delves deeply into its various subcomponents, processes, technologies, and players.

## Exploration

### Geological and Geophysical Surveys

Before any drilling begins, companies conduct extensive geological and geophysical surveys. Geological surveys involve studying rock formations and other surface features to predict where oil and gas might be located. Geophysical surveys, notably seismic surveys, use sound waves to create detailed images of the subsurface.

### Seismic Surveys

Seismic surveys are perhaps the most sophisticated tool in the exploration phase. They involve sending shock waves into the earth and measuring the reflected waves to interpret the subsurface structures. This can be done on land (onshore) or at sea ([offshore](../o/offshore.md)). Advanced techniques like 3D and 4D seismic imaging provide even more detailed information.

## Drilling

### Exploratory Drilling

Once potential sites are identified through surveys, exploratory drilling takes place. This involves drilling a well to determine if there is indeed oil or gas, and if so, to assess its quantity and quality. Exploratory wells are often called "wildcat wells".

### Appraisal Drilling

If an exploratory well is successful, [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) drilling follows. This involves drilling additional wells to delineate the reservoir extent, estimate its size, and understand its characteristics fully.

### Production Drilling

Once a reservoir is thoroughly appraised and deemed viable, production drilling begins. These wells are designed to maximize oil and gas extraction. Production drilling is highly complex, involving various techniques like directional drilling and horizontal drilling to access the reservoir more efficiently.

## Extraction

### Primary Recovery

In the primary recovery phase, the natural pressure of the reservoir, augmented by pumps, is used to bring the oil and gas to the surface. This phase may recover about 10-15% of the reservoir's original oil in place (OOIP).

### Secondary Recovery

This phase involves injecting substances like water or gas into the reservoir to maintain pressure and displace more oil. Secondary recovery techniques can boost extraction rates to 30-50% of OOIP.

### Tertiary (Enhanced) Recovery

Tertiary recovery techniques include thermal recovery, gas injection, and chemical flooding. These methods aim to alter the physical and chemical properties of the oil to make it easier to extract, potentially increasing recovery rates to 60% or more of OOIP.

## Key Technologies in Upstream

### Hydraulic Fracturing

[Hydraulic fracturing](../h/hydraulic_fracturing.md), or fracking, involves injecting high-pressure fluid into the rock to create fractures, allowing oil and gas to flow more freely. This has revolutionized the [industry](../i/industry.md) by making previously inaccessible reservoirs viable for extraction.

### Directional and Horizontal Drilling

Directional drilling allows for drilling at [multiple](../m/multiple.md) angles, not just vertical. Horizontal drilling extends the reach horizontally within the reservoir, significantly boosting extraction [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

### Blowout Preventers

Essential safety devices, Blowout Preventers (BOPs), are installed to prevent uncontrolled release of oil or gas during drilling activities. They became a focal point after incidents like the Deepwater Horizon spill.

### Remote Sensing and Monitoring

Modern upstream operations [leverage](../l/leverage.md) remote sensing technologies and IoT (Internet of Things) devices to monitor and manage operations in real-time, enhancing [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and safety.

## Environmental Considerations

### Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA)

Before any upstream activity, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is conducted to understand the potential environmental repercussions. This is crucial for securing regulatory permissions.

### Waste Management

Properly managing waste, including drilling muds, cuttings, and produced water, is a significant environmental challenge. Techniques like recycling and safe disposal are employed to mitigate impacts.

### Emission Control

Upstream activities can produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. Companies are implementing measures like carbon capture and storage (CCS) to minimize their carbon footprint.

## Regulatory Framework

### International Regulations

Upstream activities are heavily regulated by international bodies and agreements, ensuring that the operations adhere to environmental and safety standards. Examples include the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for [offshore](../o/offshore.md) activities and various climate agreements like the Paris Accord.

### National Regulations

Each country has its own regulatory framework governing upstream activities. This includes licensing, tax regimes, and stringent safety and environmental guidelines. Agencies like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) play critical roles.

## Future Trends

### Digital Transformation

### Sustainability and Renewable Integration

There is a growing focus on making upstream operations more sustainable by incorporating renewable energy sources, such as using solar power for remote drilling operations.

### Autonomous Operations
