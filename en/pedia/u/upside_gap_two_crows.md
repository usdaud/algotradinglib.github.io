# Upside Gap Two Crows

The "[Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Two Crows" is a bearish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) pattern that is used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), a method used by traders to forecast the direction of prices by studying past [market](../m/market.md) data, primarily price and [volume](../v/volume.md). This pattern is relatively rare compared to other [candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md), but it can be a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). It consists of three candlesticks: a long white (or green) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md), followed by two smaller black (or red) candlesticks that close inside the previous gap. This pattern suggests that the bullish [trend](../t/trend.md) may be running out of steam and a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) could be imminent.

## Formation of the Pattern

### Day 1
The first day of the pattern is characterized by a long white (or green) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md). This signifies that the stock, [commodity](../c/commodity.md), or other trading instrument in question has experienced significant upward movement, showing bullish strength in the [market](../m/market.md).

### Day 2
The second day opens with an upward gap, meaning that the [opening price](../o/opening_price.md) is higher than the previous day's closing price. However, throughout the day, the price decreases and forms a black (or red) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md). This [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) is smaller compared to the first day's [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) and closes within the body of the first day's [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md), but still above the prior day's close. This indicates some degree of resistance by the bears, but the bulls have not fully capitulated yet.

### Day 3
On the third day, another black (or red) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) appears. It begins at a price that [gaps](../g/gap.md) above the second day's close but falls during the day. The close price of the third day is below the close of the second day but still within the gap created on the first day. This suggests that the bears are gaining control, and the bulls are losing their [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

## Interpretation and Psychology Behind the Pattern

The psychology behind the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Two Crows pattern is fairly straightforward but deeply rooted in [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and [trader](../t/trader.md) behavior. The first long white (or green) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) indicates strong buying [interest](../i/interest.md) and bullish sentiment. The gap up on the second day suggests continued bullish enthusiasm; however, the hesitance and subsequent downturn by the close of the second day indicate that the [market](../m/market.md) is experiencing selling pressure as some traders may feel the prices have moved too far too fast.

The third day’s black (or red) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) confirms these concerns. The gap up again shows an attempt by the bulls to regain control, but as the day progresses and the price falls, it becomes clear that the bears are asserting their dominance. The closing price being below the second day's close but still within the initial gap suggests hesitation and signals that the bullish sentiment is waning.

## Trading Strategy Using Upside Gap Two Crows

### Entry
Upon confirmation of the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Two Crows pattern, traders might consider entering a short position. Confirmation typically happens when the price moves below the low of the third day's [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) in the pattern. Conservative traders may wait for further confirmation, such as a move below the first day's close.

### Stop Loss
A stop loss can be placed above the high of the second or third day's [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md). This helps to limit potential losses if the bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md) signal turns out to be a false alarm.

### Profit Target
Setting a [profit](../p/profit.md) target can depend on various factors. A common approach is to aim for a support level below the current price or to use a [risk](../r/risk.md)-reward ratio, such as 1:2 or 1:3, meaning the potential [profit](../p/profit.md) should be two or three times the amount of [risk](../r/risk.md) taken.

## Examples and Case Studies

Providing real-life examples or case studies where the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Two Crows pattern has successfully predicted [market](../m/market.md) reversals can help solidify understanding and [offer](../o/offer.md) practical insights.

For instance, traders can look at historical chart data in trading platforms or financial news websites that provide charting tools, such as TradingView or Investing.com.

## Limitations and False Signals

While the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Two Crows pattern can be a powerful tool, it is not infallible. Here are some limitations and possibilities of [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md):

### False Breakouts
The pattern can sometimes indicate a bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md), but the [market](../m/market.md) might experience a [false breakout](../f/false_breakout.md). This occurs when prices briefly move below the confirmation level but then [resume](../r/resume.md) their upward [trend](../t/trend.md). Traders should be cautious and may consider additional confirmations.

### Market Conditions
The effectiveness of the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Two Crows pattern can be influenced by overall [market](../m/market.md) conditions. For example, in a strong [bull market](../b/bull_market.md), [bearish reversal patterns](../b/bearish_reversal_patterns.md) are less likely to succeed due to the overall upward pressure. Conversely, in a [bear market](../b/bear_market.md), even weak [reversal](../r/reversal.md) signals might result in significant price corrections.

### Volume Considerations
[Volume](../v/volume.md) can play a critical role in confirming the pattern. A decline in [volume](../v/volume.md) during the formation of the pattern might weaken the reliability of the signal. Conversely, a surge in [volume](../v/volume.md) typically enhances the pattern's credibility.

### Complementary Indicators
It's often recommended to use the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Two Crows pattern in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to improve the reliability of the signal. For instance, indicators like the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI), Moving Averages, or MACD can provide additional context to the [price action](../p/price_action.md).

## Conclusion

The [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Two Crows pattern is a nuanced and somewhat rare bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md) signal in [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) charting, providing valuable insights into potential [market](../m/market.md) reversals in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). While it offers critical information about changing [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and can guide traders in making informed decisions, it should not be used in isolation. Integrating this pattern with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) and considering [market](../m/market.md) conditions can significantly enhance its efficacy, making it a more [robust](../r/robust.md) tool in a [trader](../t/trader.md)’s arsenal.
