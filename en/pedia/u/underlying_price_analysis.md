# Underlying Price Analysis

One of the core concepts in trading, especially in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (also known as `algo-trading` or `automated trading`), is the analysis of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price of an [asset](../a/asset.md). The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price refers to the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) or [asset](../a/asset.md), such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, currencies, or [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). This analysis is critical for making informed trading decisions, constructing [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), and managing [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.

## Definitions and Basics

### Underlying Asset
The `[underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)` is the [financial asset](../f/financial_asset.md) upon which a [derivative](../d/derivative.md)'s price is based. For instance, in [options](../o/options.md) trading, the stock (e.g., Apple Inc. stock) is the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) for an option on that stock. The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price of this [asset](../a/asset.md) is pivotal in determining the pricing and movement of the [derivative](../d/derivative.md) itself.

### Importance of Underlying Price
1. **Pricing [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md)**: The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price is the primary component in the pricing models of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), such as [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), and swaps.
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Accurate [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price analysis helps determine exposure and manage risks effectively.
3. **[Trading Strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md)**: Algorithms are often based on the analysis of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) prices to determine entry and exit points.
4. **[Market Sentiment Analysis](../m/market_sentiment_analysis.md)**: Changes in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price can reflect [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment, [market](../m/market.md) trends, and economic factors.

## Methods of Underlying Price Analysis

### Fundamental Analysis
[Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) involves evaluating the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. 

1. **[Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md)**: Analysis of a company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, balance sheets, [income](../i/income.md) statements, [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) statements.
2. **[Economic Indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md)**: GDP growth, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates, employment data.
3. **[Industry Analysis](../i/industry_analysis.md)**: Comparing the company with its peers in the same sector.
4. **Company Analysis**: Management effectiveness, [business](../b/business.md) model, [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md).

### Technical Analysis
[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) focuses on statistical analysis of [market](../m/market.md) activity, such as price movement and [volume](../v/volume.md).

1. **Price Charts**: Line charts, bar charts, and [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) charts to visualize price movements.
2. **Indicators and Oscillators**: Moving averages, [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI), Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD).
3. **Patterns**: Head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, triangles, flags.
4. **[Volume Analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md)**: Observing the trading [volume](../v/volume.md) to confirm trends and price moves.

### Quantitative Analysis
[Quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) involves using mathematical and statistical models to analyze price data and predict future movements.

1. **Algorithmic Models**: Using algorithms to identify profitable trading opportunities.
2. **Statistical Approaches**: [Regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md), time-series analysis.
3. **Machine Learning**: Using AI and machine learning models to predict price movements.

### Sentiment Analysis
[Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) gauges the mood or attitude of the [market](../m/market.md) participants.

1. **News Analysis**: Monitoring news, [social media](../s/social_media.md), and reports to gauge [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).
2. **[Sentiment Indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md)**: [Fear and Greed Index](../f/fear_and_greed_index.md), [sentiment surveys](../s/sentiment_surveys.md), and indices.
