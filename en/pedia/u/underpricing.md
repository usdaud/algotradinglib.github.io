# Underpricing

## Introduction

Underpricing is a financial term that refers to the phenomenon where a new stock's initial public [offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO) price is set lower than its [market value](../m/market_value.md). This is a common occurrence in [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, reducing the cost for investors to buy [shares](../s/shares.md) during an IPO, but often at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of the issuing company, resulting in a missed opportunity for higher [capital](../c/capital.md) inflow.

## Causes of Underpricing

1. **[Asymmetric Information](../a/asymmetric_information.md)**
 - **[Issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s Perspective**: Issuers may possess more detailed information about the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s true [value](../v/value.md) compared to investors. To counteract this information asymmetry, the price is set lower to ensure investors are compensated for the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [investing](../i/investing.md) in a potentially [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) company.
 - **[Investor](../i/investor.md)'s Perspective**: Investors may [demand](../d/demand.md) a lower price to protect themselves against the [risk](../r/risk.md) arising from the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s superior information.

2. **[Underwriter](../u/underwriter.md)'s Incentives**
 - **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation**: Underwriters, who guarantee the IPO by buying the [shares](../s/shares.md) themselves if they cannot sell to the public, might prefer underpricing to reduce their [risk](../r/risk.md). They aim to avoid the situation where they are stuck with unsold [shares](../s/shares.md).
 - **Reputation Concerns**: Reputable underwriters may practice underpricing to ensure a successful IPO. Successful IPOs enhance their reputation, attracting future [business](../b/business.md).

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**
 - **[Bull](../b/bull.md) Markets**: In bullish [market](../m/market.md) conditions, there is a higher likelihood of underpricing due to increased [investor](../i/investor.md) optimism and [demand](../d/demand.md).
 - **Bear Markets**: Conversely, in bearish markets, underpricing is used to attract [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors.

4. **Regulatory Factors**
 - Laws and regulations may also influence IPO pricing strategies, leading companies to adopt conservative pricing approaches to comply with regulatory bodies and avoid potential legal issues.

## Methods to Measure Underpricing

1. **First-Day [Return](../r/return.md)**
 - The difference between the IPO price and the closing price on the first trading day. This [return](../r/return.md) is often used as a direct measure of underpricing.

2. **Initial [Return](../r/return.md)**
 - The initial [return](../r/return.md) over the first few days or weeks post-IPO is calculated to determine the early performance and extent of underpricing.

3. **Price [Performance Benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md)**
 - Comparing the IPO price with the average [market](../m/market.md) performance of similar [stocks](../s/stock.md) can indicate the level of underpricing.

## Consequences of Underpricing

### For Issuers
- **Loss of Potential [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: Issuers potentially lose [money](../m/money.md) that could have been raised if the IPO was priced closer to [market value](../m/market_value.md).
- **[Perceived Value](../p/perceived_value.md)**: Consistent underpricing might lead to [market](../m/market.md) perceptions of [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) about the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s true [value](../v/value.md).

### For Investors
- **Immediate Gains**: Investors who purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) at the IPO price and sell them quickly can realize substantial gains.
- **Long-Term Holding [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Investors may face higher long-term risks if the stock price aligns with the ‘true’ [value](../v/value.md) over time, potentially leading to losses.

### For Underwriters
- **[Commission](../c/commission.md) Benefits**: Underwriters benefit from commissions on the [volume](../v/volume.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) sold, regardless of the price. High sales volumes due to underpricing add to their [revenue](../r/revenue.md).

## Examples of Underpricing

Some notable examples of underpriced IPOs include:

1. **Facebook**
 (Facebook IPO initially saw significant underpricing in 2012, reflecting high [demand](../d/demand.md) and speculative trading post-IPO.)

2. **Alibaba**
 (Alibaba's IPO was underpriced, allowing the stock to surge after its initial listing in 2014.)

3. **Snap Inc.**
 (Snapchat's [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) faced severe underpricing during its IPO in 2017.)

## Strategies to Mitigate Underpricing

1. **[Book Building](../b/book_building.md) Approach**
 - Involves gathering [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) at various price levels before setting the final IPO price to reflect [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) more accurately.

2. **[Dutch Auction](../d/dutch_auction.md)**
 - Investors [bid](../b/bid.md) for [shares](../s/shares.md) at prices they are willing to pay. The IPO price is set based on these bids, often minimizing underpricing.

3. **Lock-Up Periods**
 - Restricts the [sale](../s/sale.md) of IPO [shares](../s/shares.md) by insiders for a set period, typically 90 to 180 days, providing stability in stock prices post-IPO.

## Conclusion

Underpricing is an intricate phenomenon influenced by [multiple](../m/multiple.md) factors, including information asymmetry, [underwriter](../u/underwriter.md) incentives, and [market](../m/market.md) conditions. While it guarantees [demand](../d/demand.md) and mitigates certain risks, it often results in substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) loss for issuing companies. Companies and underwriters need to adopt [robust](../r/robust.md) strategies like [book building](../b/book_building.md) and auctions to mitigate the adverse effects of underpricing.
