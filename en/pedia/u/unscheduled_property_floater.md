# Unscheduled Property Floater

An unscheduled property floater is a type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy or [endorsement](../e/endorsement.md) that provides coverage for [personal property](../p/personal_property.md) items without specifically listing them or assigning individual values. This type of policy is especially useful for items that are high in [value](../v/value.md) or prone to damage, loss, or theft, where the collective [value](../v/value.md) exceeds the standard coverage limits provided by a typical homeowner's or [renter's insurance](../r/renter's_insurance.md) policy.

## Understanding Unscheduled Property Floaters

### Basic Concept

The unscheduled property floater is designed to fill [gaps](../g/gap.md) left by traditional [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies. Most homeowner's or [renter's insurance](../r/renter's_insurance.md) policies [will](../w/will.md) have specific limits on the coverage for certain types of [personal property](../p/personal_property.md), such as jewelry, electronics, or collectibles. If the [value](../v/value.md) of these items surpasses the limit, the policyholder could face considerable [out-of-pocket expenses](../o/out-of-pocket_expenses.md) in the event of loss or damage.

An unscheduled property floater provides additional coverage for these items, without the need to itemize each one individually. This is different from a "scheduled" property floater, where each item must be [listed](../l/listed.md) along with its [value](../v/value.md).

### Coverage Details

- **Broad Protection**: Unlike standard policies that may exclude certain types of loss, unscheduled property floaters typically [offer](../o/offer.md) broader protection, covering incidents such as accidental damage, loss, and theft.
- **Higher Limits**: These policies often provide higher coverage limits than traditional [home](../h/home.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md). This is crucial for high-[value](../v/value.md) items that exceed the standard policy limits.
- **[Worldwide Coverage](../w/worldwide_coverage.md)**: One of the attractions of an unscheduled property floater is that it often includes [worldwide coverage](../w/worldwide_coverage.md), protecting your items wherever you travel.
- **Flexibility**: There's no need to update the policy each time you acquire a new item of [value](../v/value.md), unlike scheduled floaters which require updates and appraisals.

### Example Use-Cases

Unscheduled property floaters are frequently used for:

- **Jewelry and Watches**: These are high-[value](../v/value.md) items that exceed typical policy sub-limits.
- **Electronics**: Laptops, cameras, and other high-tech gadgets.
- **Fine Art**: Paintings, sculptures, and other valuable collectibles.
- **Musical Instruments**: Especially useful for professional musicians who travel frequently.
- **Sports Equipment**: Expensive items like skis, golf clubs, and other specialized gear.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Convenience**: Handling new purchases or changes does not require constant updates to the policy.
2. **Broad Coverage**: Offers extensive protection against all types of risks, including accidental damage and [worldwide coverage](../w/worldwide_coverage.md).
3. **Higher Limits**: Provides coverage for items that exceed the sub-limits of standard policies.

### Disadvantages

1. **Cost**: Generally, unscheduled property floaters are more expensive than standard policy add-ons due to the broader coverage and higher limits.
2. **Documentation**: In case of a claim, you may still need to provide proof of ownership and [value](../v/value.md).
3. **Ambiguity**: The lack of itemization can sometimes create ambiguity during the claims process.

## Acquisition Process

Obtaining an unscheduled property floater generally involves:

1. **Assessing Needs**: Determine whether your [personal property](../p/personal_property.md) exceeds the coverage limits of your existing policy.
2. **Consulting with Insurer**: Discuss with your [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provider the specific terms, coverage limits, and [premium](../p/premium.md) associated with the floater.
3. **Documentation**: While itemization isn't necessary, keeping [receipts](../r/receipt.md) and appraisals as supporting documents for future claims is advisable.
4. **Policy Addition**: The floater is added as an [endorsement](../e/endorsement.md) to your existing homeowner's or [renter's insurance](../r/renter's_insurance.md) policy.

## Claims Process

In the event of a claim, the general steps are:

1. **Report the Incident**: Notify your [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provider about the loss or damage as soon as possible.
2. **Provide Proof**: Submit any available proof of ownership and [value](../v/value.md), like [receipts](../r/receipt.md) or appraisals.
3. **Claim Assessment**: The insurer [will](../w/will.md) assess the claim based on the policy terms.
4. **[Payout](../p/payout.md)**: If the claim is approved, the insurer [will](../w/will.md) [issue](../i/issue.md) a [payout](../p/payout.md) based on the agreed limits.

## Conclusion

With their broader coverage, higher limits, and worldwide protection, they [offer](../o/offer.md) a level of [security](../s/security.md) and peace of mind that’s worth the additional cost. However, policyholders should always thoroughly understand the terms and conditions, and maintain documentation of their valuable items to facilitate the claims process.
