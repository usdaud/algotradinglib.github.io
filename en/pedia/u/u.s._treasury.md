# U.S. Treasury

The U.S. Treasury, formally known as the United States Department of the Treasury, is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government responsible for formulating and enforcing the country's economic and fiscal policies, managing federal finances, collecting [taxes](../t/taxes.md), paying federal bills, managing [currency](../c/currency.md), government accounts, and public [debt](../d/debt.md).

## Treasury Securities
Treasury securities are [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments issued by the U.S. Treasury to [fund](../f/fund.md) federal operations. They are considered one of the safest investments due to the backing of the U.S. government:

### Treasury Bills (T-Bills)
- Short-term securities with maturities ranging from a few days to one year.
- Sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) from their [face value](../f/face_value.md); the difference between the purchase price and [face value](../f/face_value.md) is the [interest](../i/interest.md) earned.

### Treasury Notes (T-Notes)
- Medium-term securities with maturities ranging from two to ten years.
- Pay [interest](../i/interest.md) every six months and [return](../r/return.md) the [face value](../f/face_value.md) upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)
- Long-term securities with maturities of 20 or 30 years.
- Pay [interest](../i/interest.md) every six months and [return](../r/return.md) [face value](../f/face_value.md) upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
- [Principal](../p/principal.md) is adjusted based on changes in the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index.md) (CPI).
- Provide protection against [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Savings Bonds

## Impact on Financial Markets
The U.S. Treasury significantly influences [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) through various channels:

### Interest Rates
The issuance of Treasury securities affects [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. When the Treasury issues a large amount of [debt](../d/debt.md), it can lead to higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates as investors [demand](../d/demand.md) a higher [yield](../y/yield.md) to compensate for increased [supply](../s/supply.md).

### Federal Reserve Coordination
The U.S. Treasury coordinates closely with the Federal Reserve on [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). The Treasury's [debt](../d/debt.md) management strategy can influence the Fed's [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md) and vice versa.

### Global Safe Asset
U.S. Treasury securities are considered a global safe [asset](../a/asset.md), attracting investment from around the world, especially during times of financial [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). This global [demand](../d/demand.md) helps keep U.S. borrowing costs low.

## Technological Advancements and Fintech
The U.S. Treasury has embraced technological advancements to improve its operations, enhance financial stability, and protect against financial crimes:

### Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
- Exploring the use of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) for secure and transparent financial transactions.
- Enhancing the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of settlement and clearance processes in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Leveraging AI and machine learning to detect [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md) and financial [fraud](../f/fraud.md).
- Improving [predictive analytics](../p/predictive_analytics.md) for [economic forecasting](../e/economic_forecasting.md) and policy-making.

### Digital Currency
- Researching the potential for a Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) [Digital Currency](../d/digital_currency.md) (CBDC) to enhance [payment](../p/payment.md) systems and [financial inclusion](../f/financial_inclusion.md).
- Collaboration with the Federal Reserve and other stakeholders on [digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md) initiatives.
