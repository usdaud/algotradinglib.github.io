# Uganda Securities Exchange (USE)

The Uganda Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (USE) is the [principal](../p/principal.md) stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of Uganda. It was founded in 1997 and is licensed under the [Capital Markets](../c/capital_markets.md) Authority Act, which regulates the securities [industry](../i/industry.md) in Uganda. It acts as a platform for trading [shares](../s/shares.md), bonds, and other financial instruments. The USE also provides a mechanism for companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs).

## History and Background
The USE was established to stimulate the [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) in Uganda, which were still in a nascent stage during the 1990s. It became functional on January 25, 1998. The first company to be [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) was Uganda Clays Limited. Since then, the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) has grown, listing more companies and diversifying its product offerings.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of USE are to:
- Facilitate the raising of [capital](../c/capital.md) for businesses.
- Provide an efficient vehicle for investors to buy and sell securities.
- Enhance [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md).
- Act as a barometer for the [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Market Structure
The Uganda Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) employs an electronic trading system, which replaced the manual call-over system in 2015. This system is known as the Automated Trading System (ATS). The ATS facilitates greater [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the trading process.

## Listed Companies
Currently, the USE has [multiple](../m/multiple.md) companies [listed](../l/listed.md) across various sectors, including banking, telecommunication, and [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md). Some of the notable companies include:
- Stanbic [Bank](../b/bank.md) Uganda Limited
- British American Tobacco Uganda
- Uganda Clays Limited
- KCB Group
- Umeme Limited


## Trading Hours
Trading at the Uganda Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) takes place on weekdays from Monday to Friday. The official trading hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM EAT (East Africa Time). However, the settlement window extends beyond these trading hours.

## Products and Services
### Equities
Equities are the primary type of [security](../s/security.md) traded on the USE. Companies [issue](../i/issue.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public, allowing them to become partial owners. The prices of these [shares](../s/shares.md) fluctuate based on [demand](../d/demand.md) and [supply](../s/supply.md).

### Bonds
The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) also provides a platform for trading government and corporate bonds. These are [debt](../d/debt.md) securities that pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) and [return](../r/return.md) the [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). Bonds are generally considered safer investments compared to equities.

### Index
The Uganda Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) has developed indices to reflect the performance of the [listed](../l/listed.md) securities. One such [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is the USE All Share [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (ALSI), which tracks the [market](../m/market.md) capitalisation of all [listed](../l/listed.md) companies.

### Derivatives
As of now, the USE does not [offer](../o/offer.md) [derivative](../d/derivative.md) products like [futures](../f/futures.md) or [options](../o/options.md). However, plans are in place to integrate these products as the [market](../m/market.md) matures.

## Regulatory Framework
The USE operates under the oversight of the [Capital Markets](../c/capital_markets.md) Authority (CMA) of Uganda. The CMA ensures that the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) operates in a fair, transparent, and efficient manner. Regulatory frameworks cover aspects such as [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md), [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) standards, and trading regulations.

## Technological Infrastructure
The transition to an Automated Trading System has significantly improved the operations at the Uganda Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md). The system enhances [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and ensures more accurate [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md). It also allows for real-time trading and minimizes operational risks. The ATS is integrated with the Securities Central [Depository](../d/depository.md) (SCD), which facilitates the electronic holding of securities and streamlines the settlement process.

## Market Performance
The [market](../m/market.md) performance is measured using various indicators such as price trends, trading volumes, and [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).
### Market Capitalization
[Market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) is the aggregate [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of all [listed](../l/listed.md) companies on the USE and serves as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the [market](../m/market.md)’s size.

### Trading Volume and Liquidity
Trading [volume](../v/volume.md) measures the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) exchanged during a given period, whereas [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) refers to the ease with which assets can be converted into cash without significantly affecting their [market price](../m/market_price.md). Both metrics are crucial for evaluating [market](../m/market.md) health.

## Challenges
### Limited Number of Listings
One of the major challenges facing the USE is the limited number of [listed](../l/listed.md) companies. This lack of depth restricts [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) choices.

### Low Trading Volumes
Another significant challenge is the low trading [volume](../v/volume.md), which affects [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Limited public awareness and participation contribute to this [issue](../i/issue.md).

### Regulatory Hurdles
Stringent regulatory requirements can be a double-edged sword. While they might ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) protection, they can also deter companies from listing on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) due to compliance costs.

### Technological Adoption
Although the ATS has improved trading [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), the full potential of technology has yet to be realized, particularly in areas like high-frequency trading and algo-trading.

## Future Prospects
Despite these challenges, the Uganda Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) has significant growth potential. Plans include increasing the number of [listed](../l/listed.md) companies through incentives, enhancing technological [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), and introducing new financial instruments like [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

### Financial Education
One critical area of focus is [financial literacy](../f/financial_literacy.md). Educating the public about the benefits of [investing](../i/investing.md) in securities can drive higher participation rates.

### Regional Integration
The USE is exploring collaboration with other East African stock exchanges to create a more integrated and [robust](../r/robust.md) regional [market](../m/market.md). This initiative could enhance [cross-border trading](../c/cross-border_trading.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [capital](../c/capital.md) formation.

### Digital Transformation
Further adoption of digital and mobile technologies can also boost [market](../m/market.md) participation. For instance, mobile trading apps could make it easier for individual investors to engage with the [market](../m/market.md).

## Conclusion
The Uganda Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) plays a pivotal role in the financial ecosystem of Uganda. While it faces several challenges, the potential for growth and development remains significant. Through regulatory support, technological advancements, and increased public awareness, the USE aims to become a more dynamic and influential player in the East African [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
