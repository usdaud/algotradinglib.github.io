# Underlying Financials

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) leverages financial models to facilitate the buying and selling of securities at exceptionally high speeds and with minimal human intervention. Within this sophisticated realm, one pivotal element that traders analyze is the "[underlying](../u/underlying.md) financials" related to various assets. This term encompasses the fundamental financial metrics and [performance indicators](../p/performance_indicators.md) of the entities to which these [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) are applied.

#### Definition of Underlying Financials

[Underlying](../u/underlying.md) financials refer to the core financial data and [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) of a [business](../b/business.md) or [asset](../a/asset.md). These are often used as part of the decision-making process in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) to predict future price movements, evaluate the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of a company, and make informed trading decisions. This detailed financial data includes, but is not limited to, [revenue](../r/revenue.md), [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md), [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS), [debt](../d/debt.md) levels, cash flows, and other key [performance indicators](../p/performance_indicators.md) (KPIs).

#### Key Components of Underlying Financials

1. **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: This represents the total [income](../i/income.md) generated by the [sale](../s/sale.md) of goods or services related to the company's primary operations. [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth over time is a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of [business](../b/business.md) performance and is often scrutinized in [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).
   
2. **Net [Income](../i/income.md)**: Net [income](../i/income.md), commonly referred to as the [bottom line](../b/bottom_line.md), is the [profit](../p/profit.md) a company has after all expenses and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) have been deducted from total [revenue](../r/revenue.md). It is a vital component that reflects the company's profitability.

3. **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS)**: EPS is a measure of a company's profitability on a per-share [basis](../b/basis.md). It is calculated by dividing the net [income](../i/income.md) by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) of [common stock](../c/common_stock.md).

4. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Levels**: The amount of [debt](../d/debt.md) a company carries is a significant [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of its [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [leverage](../l/leverage.md). Common measures include the [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio and [interest coverage ratio](../i/interest_coverage_ratio.md), which provide insights into a company’s [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md) capacity.

5. **[Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)**: [Cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) analysis involves examining the inflows and outflows of cash within a company. Positive [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) indicates that a company is generating enough cash to maintain operations and invest in future growth, crucial for ensuring [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

6. **Gross and Operating Margins**: [Gross margin](../g/gross_margin.md) is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from total [revenue](../r/revenue.md), while [operating margin](../o/operating_margin.md) is derived by subtracting operating expenses from [gross profit](../g/gross_profit.md). These margins show how efficiently a company is running its operations and managing costs.

7. **[Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROE) and [Return on Assets](../r/return_on_assets_(roa).md) (ROA)**: These metrics evaluate how effectively a company is using its [equity](../e/equity.md) and assets to generate profits, [offering](../o/offering.md) a glimpse into management [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

#### Application in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems harness [underlying](../u/underlying.md) financials to construct more accurate and predictive financial models. These models drive [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that can be fine-tuned to exploit [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies, optimize [trade](../t/trade.md) timing, and manage [risk](../r/risk.md) more effectively. Some applications include:

1. **Predictive Modelling**: By incorporating financial metrics, algorithms can predict future stock prices, [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md), and other [market](../m/market.md) behaviors with greater accuracy.

2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Understanding the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of an entity allows for better [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment and management. Portfolio allocation strategies can be adjusted based on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) financial stability of the assets.

3. **Events Analysis**: Algorithms track [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, mergers, stock splits, and other company events. They can [trade](../t/trade.md) based on anticipated [market](../m/market.md) reactions to these changes in a company's [underlying](../u/underlying.md) financials.

4. **[Fundamental Analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) Integration**: While [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) often relies on [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), incorporating [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) and [underlying](../u/underlying.md) financials can provide a comprehensive [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) and improve overall performance.

5. **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: In HFT, even minor discrepancies in [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) data can be exploited for substantial gains. Real-time [data integration](../d/data_integration.md) and analysis of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) financials play a crucial role in making split-second trading decisions.
