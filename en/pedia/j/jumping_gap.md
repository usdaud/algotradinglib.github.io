# Jumping Gap

A jumping gap refers to a sequence of price bars where gaps occur repeatedly in the same direction, reflecting sustained momentum and aggressive order flow. It is sometimes used as a synonym for a runaway or continuation gap sequence.

## How it appears
- Multiple gaps in the direction of the trend.
- Little overlap between consecutive bars.
- Strong volume and broad market participation.

## Interpretation
Jumping gaps suggest a powerful trend, but they can also mark a late stage move if the gaps become extreme. Traders watch for signs of exhaustion such as long wicks or a failed gap.

## Example
A stock in a strong uptrend gaps higher for two consecutive sessions. The gaps are not filled and volume remains strong. Traders view this as a continuation signal but remain alert for exhaustion.

## Practical notes
Risk control is critical because trend reversals after extended gap runs can be sharp.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Jumping Gap and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Jumping Gap as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Jumping Gap, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Jumping Gap. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Jumping Gap alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
