# JGB Futures Trading

## Introduction

JGB (Japanese [Government Bond](../g/government_bond.md)) [futures](../f/futures.md) are financial contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, a specific quantity of Japanese government bonds at a future date and for a price agreed upon at the time of the contract. JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) are widely used by investors and financial institutions to manage [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), speculate on [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements, and [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the Japanese [bond market](../b/bond_market.md).

## Overview of JGB Futures

JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) are traded on the Tokyo Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (TSE) and the Osaka [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (OSE). These [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are based on Japanese government bonds, which are denominated in Japanese yen. The most commonly traded JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) are the 10-year JGB [futures](../f/futures.md), although there are also [futures](../f/futures.md) available for 2-year, 5-year, and 20-year JGBs.

### Key Features

1. **Contract Size**: The standard contract size for 10-year JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) is ¥100 million. This means that each [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) represents ¥100 million worth of 10-year Japanese government bonds.

2. **[Quotation](../q/quotation.md)**: JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) are quoted in terms of their price, which represents a percentage of the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) bonds. For example, a price of 100.00 would indicate that the bonds are being traded at [par value](../p/par_value.md).

3. **[Tick Size](../t/tick_size.md)**: The minimum price movement, or [tick size](../t/tick_size.md), for JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) is 0.01, which corresponds to a change of ¥10,000 per contract.

4. **Delivery**: JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) can be settled either through [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) bonds or through cash settlement. However, in practice, most JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) are settled through cash settlement.

### Participants

The JGB [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) consists of various participants, including:
- **Institutional Investors**: Such as [asset](../a/asset.md) managers, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, and pension funds, who use JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) exposure.
- **Speculators**: Including [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms, who seek to [profit](../p/profit.md) from anticipated movements in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Strategies for JGB Futures Trading

There are several [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) employed by [market](../m/market.md) participants in the JGB [futures market](../f/futures_market.md). Here are some common strategies:

### Hedging

Hedging involves taking a position in the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) the [risk](../r/risk.md) of an adverse price movement in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) bonds. For example, if an [institutional investor](../i/institutional_investor.md) holds a portfolio of Japanese government bonds and is concerned about potential [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) increases (which would lead to a decline in [bond](../b/bond.md) prices), they can sell JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against this [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Speculation

Speculators take positions in JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) based on their expectations of future [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements. If a [trader](../t/trader.md) believes that [interest](../i/interest.md) rates [will](../w/will.md) rise, they might short-sell JGB [futures](../f/futures.md), expecting the price to fall. Conversely, if they believe [interest](../i/interest.md) rates [will](../w/will.md) decline, they might go long on JGB [futures](../f/futures.md), anticipating a price increase.

### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies involve taking advantage of price discrepancies between JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) bonds or other [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) instruments. Arbitrageurs aim to [profit](../p/profit.md) from these price differences with minimal [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Spread Trading

[Spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md) involves taking simultaneous long and short positions in different JGB [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from changes in the spread between them. For instance, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might go long on a 10-year JGB [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) while shorting a 2-year JGB [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) if they expect the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) to steepen.

## Risks in JGB Futures Trading

While JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) trading offers several opportunities, it also comes with various risks. Some of the key risks include:

### Market Risk

[Market risk](../m/market_risk.md) refers to the [risk](../r/risk.md) of losses due to adverse movements in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Since JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) are highly sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes, unexpected rate hikes or cuts can lead to significant losses.

### Liquidity Risk

[Liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md) arises when a [trader](../t/trader.md) is unable to enter or exit positions without significantly impacting the [market price](../m/market_price.md). Although the JGB [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) is generally [liquid](../l/liquid.md), certain [market](../m/market.md) conditions can reduce [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), making it challenging to execute large trades.

### Basis Risk

[Basis risk](../b/basis_risk.md) occurs when the price relationship between the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) bonds diverges. This can happen due to changes in [interest rate spreads](../i/interest_rate_spreads.md) or other factors that affect the pricing of the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) relative to the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) bonds.

### Counterparty Risk

[Counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the other party in a [trade](../t/trade.md) defaults on its [obligations](../o/obligation.md). In the case of JGB [futures](../f/futures.md), this [risk](../r/risk.md) is mitigated by the clearinghouse, which acts as an intermediary and guarantees the performance of both parties.

## Regulatory Environment

JGB [futures](../f/futures.md) trading is subject to regulation by Japanese financial authorities, including the Financial Services Agency (FSA) and the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA). These regulations aim to ensure the integrity and stability of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and protect investors.

### Key Regulations

1. **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Traders are required to post [margin](../m/margin.md), which is a percentage of the contract's [value](../v/value.md), as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to enter into a [futures](../f/futures.md) position. This ensures that both parties have a financial stake in the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

2. **Reporting Requirements**: [Market](../m/market.md) participants must report their [futures](../f/futures.md) positions to regulatory authorities to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and monitor for potential [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md).

3. **Limits on Positions**: There are limits on the maximum number of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) that a single [trader](../t/trader.md) can [hold](../h/hold.md), to prevent excessive [speculation](../s/speculation.md) and concentration of [market power](../m/market_power.md).
