# Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR)

The Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR) is the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which banks in South Africa borrow and lend funds among themselves. It serves as a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the cost of borrowing in the South African financial [market](../m/market.md) and is used as a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) for various financial instruments, including loans, mortgages, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). JIBAR is similar to other global interbank rates such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate, discontinued in 2023) and EURIBOR ([Euro](../e/euro.md) Interbank Offered Rate) but is specifically tailored to the South African banking environment.

## History and Development

### Inception

JIBAR was introduced in the mid-1990s amid the liberalization of South Africa’s [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). The rate was established to foster more [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in the nation's [money](../m/money.md) markets. Prior to JIBAR, South Africa primarily used the South African [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [Overnight Rate](../o/overnight_rate.md) (SABOR), but it was deemed less effective for term lending.

### Governing and Regulatory Bodies

JIBAR is governed by the South African Reserve [Bank](../b/bank.md) (SARB) and is calculated on a daily [basis](../b/basis.md) by the SARB. The rate represents the average of rates at which South African banks are willing to lend unsecured funds to each other over various periods, commonly ranging from one to twelve months.

## Calculation Methodology

The calculation of JIBAR is a straightforward process involving the following steps:

1. **Collection of Quotes**: Each morning, a panel of major South African banks submits their [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) quotes for interbank lending. These quotes represent the rates at which they are willing to lend funds to other banks.
2. **Exclusion of Outliers**: To avoid skewing the average, the highest and lowest 20% of the quotes are excluded from the calculation.
3. **Averaging the Remaining Quotes**: The remaining quotes are averaged to determine the JIBAR for that day.

### Publishing the Rate

The finalized rate is published daily by the SARB and various other financial information platforms. The published JIBAR rates include different maturities such as one-month, three-month, six-month, and twelve-month rates.

## Usage in Financial Instruments

JIBAR serves as a foundational [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) for a variety of financial products in South Africa:

### Loans and Mortgages

Many commercial loans and mortgages in South Africa are pegged to the JIBAR. Adjustments to [loan](../l/loan.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are typically structured as JIBAR plus a specified [margin](../m/margin.md). This ensures that lending rates reflect prevailing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Bonds and Fixed-Income Securities

Corporate and government bonds might also use JIBAR as a reference. Bonds issued with a [floating interest rate](../f/floating_interest_rate.md) often have coupon payments that are determined by JIBAR plus a predetermined spread.

### Derivatives

[Financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md), such as [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md), frequently use JIBAR as the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) rate. In these contracts, parties agree to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) future cash flows based on the specified JIBAR.

### Treasury Operations

Corporate treasuries use JIBAR for [cash management](../c/cash_management.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment. By [tying](../t/tying.md) lending and borrowing activities to JIBAR, treasurers can better manage [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md).

## Importance and Influence

### Economic Indicator

JIBAR is not only a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for financial transactions but also a vital [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md). Movements in the JIBAR can reflect changes in [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), and overall economic health.

### Policy Implications

The SARB closely monitors JIBAR as part of its [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) framework. Fluctuations in JIBAR can influence the central [bank](../b/bank.md)'s decisions on setting the repo rate, which in turn affects the broader [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Market Sentiment

Changes in JIBAR can also be an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). A rising JIBAR may suggest tightening [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) or increased [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) among banks, whereas a declining JIBAR may indicate easing conditions.

## Comparison with Other Interbank Rates

While JIBAR serves the South African [market](../m/market.md), it [shares](../s/shares.md) similarities with other global interbank rates but also exhibits unique characteristics tailored to local conditions:

### LIBOR

LIBOR, once the most widely used [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), represented the average rate at which major global banks lend to each other. While similar in function to JIBAR, LIBOR covered various currencies and maturities. Following manipulation scandals and structural weaknesses, LIBOR was discontinued in 2023 and replaced by risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and €STR (EUR).

### EURIBOR

EURIBOR serves the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) and is calculated as the average rate at which [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) banks lend to each other. It functions similarly to JIBAR in terms of its role as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) but is specifically for the [Euro](../e/euro.md) [currency](../c/currency.md).

### SABOR

The South African [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [Overnight Rate](../o/overnight_rate.md) (SABOR) is another [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate in South Africa but primarily targets overnight lending, whereas JIBAR covers longer maturities.

## Challenges and Criticisms

### Transparency and Manipulation

Like other interbank rates, JIBAR has faced scrutiny regarding its [transparency](../t/transparency.md). Concerns have been raised about potential manipulation by contributing banks, although stringent regulations and oversight by the SARB mitigate this [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Market Liquidity

The effectiveness of JIBAR as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) can be influenced by [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). In times of financial stress, limited transactions may skew the rate, making it less representative of the true cost of interbank lending.

## Recent Developments

### Transition to Risk-Free Rates

Globally, there has been a shift towards more transparent and [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates. While JIBAR remains [robust](../r/robust.md), there are ongoing discussions about whether South Africa should adopt additional rates or frameworks to [complement](../c/complement.md) or potentially replace JIBAR in the future.

### Digital and Fintech Integration

As the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) evolve, there is growing [interest](../i/interest.md) in integrating JIBAR with digital platforms and fintech solutions. This aims to enhance the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and accessibility of financial products linked to JIBAR.

## Conclusion

The Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR) is a cornerstone of the South African [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), providing a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for a myriad of financial instruments. Governed by the South African Reserve [Bank](../b/bank.md), JIBAR's [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reliability are crucial for maintaining confidence in South Africa’s [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Despite facing similar challenges as other interbank rates, JIBAR continues to be a pivotal element in South Africa's economic framework, evolving alongside global and technological developments.
