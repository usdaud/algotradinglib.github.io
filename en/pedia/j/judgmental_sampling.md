# Judgmental Sampling

### Introduction

Judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md), also known as purposive or subjective [sampling](../s/sampling.md), refers to a non-probability [sampling](../s/sampling.md) technique where the researcher's judgement is utilized to select the sample. This approach relies on the researcher's experience and knowledge of the population to choose participants who are most likely to provide valuable and relevant data. In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) can be a valuable method for selecting specific data points or securities to analyze and [trade](../t/trade.md), tailoring the dataset to fit unique strategies and insights.

### Application in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves using pre-programmed trading instructions to execute trades at high speed and [volume](../v/volume.md). The [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and success of these algorithms often depend upon the quality of the data used to train and optimize them. Judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) can play a pivotal role in this process by allowing traders and analysts to select data that best represents the [market](../m/market.md) conditions and behaviours they are interested in.

#### Data Selection

In judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md), analysts select data points based on specific attributes or criteria that they believe are crucial for [trade](../t/trade.md) decisions. For instance, they might focus on:
- [Stocks](../s/stock.md) from companies with similar [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations
- Securities from industries known for high [volatility](../v/volatility.md)
- Time periods with known economic events or trends

This targeted selection process can help ensure that the algorithm is trained on the most relevant data, potentially increasing its predictive power and effectiveness.

#### Examples from the Industry

1. **Renaissance Technologies**: This [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) is known for its highly sophisticated [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and heavy reliance on [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Renaissance Technologies uses vast amounts of data and various [sampling](../s/sampling.md) techniques, including judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md), to fine-tune its [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). For more information, visit [Renaissance Technologies](https://www.rentec.com).

2. **Two Sigma**: Another major player in the [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) space, Two Sigma employs [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and other advanced technologies to analyze large datasets. They might use judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) to ensure their models are fed with data most likely to [yield](../y/yield.md) valuable insights. More details can be found at [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com).

3. **AQR [Capital](../c/capital.md) Management**: AQR uses a combination of [quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) and judgmental decision-making when developing and implementing their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). This includes leveraging judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) to create datasets that reflect specific [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Explore their approach further at [AQR Capital Management](https://www.aqr.com).

### Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Strengths

- **Relevance**: By picking data points that are deemed most relevant, algorithms can potentially perform better in real-world scenarios.
- **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: This method saves time and resources since analysts and traders focus only on a subset of the data that meets specific criteria.
- **Flexibility**: Judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) allows for adjustments based on the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s or analyst’s evolving understanding of [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

#### Weaknesses

- **Bias**: The primary drawback is the introduction of bias. Personal [judgment](../j/judgment.md) can lead to biased samples that do not accurately represent the [market](../m/market.md) or trading conditions.
- **Lack of Generalizability**: Since the sample is not random, the results may not be applicable to broader [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
- **[Overfitting](../o/overfitting.md)**: There's a [risk](../r/risk.md) that the algorithm could overfit to the selected sample and perform poorly on unseen data.

### Best Practices

To mitigate the weaknesses of judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) while leveraging its strengths, various [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) can be employed:

1. **Combining with Random [Sampling](../s/sampling.md)**: Use a mix of judgmental and random [sampling](../s/sampling.md) to balance relevance and representativeness.
2. **Continuous Evaluation**: Regularly assess and update the judgmental criteria based on performance outcomes and new [market](../m/market.md) insights.
3. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Clearly document the criteria used for selecting samples to maintain [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and enable reproducibility of results.

### Case Studies

#### Case Study 1: Volatility Trading

A trading [firm](../f/firm.md) specializing in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) trading might use judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) to select periods of extreme [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) for training their algorithms. By focusing solely on these high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) periods, the [firm](../f/firm.md) ensures that their models are especially adept at navigating turbulent markets.

#### Case Study 2: Sector-Specific Models

Another [firm](../f/firm.md) might develop sector-specific [trading models](../t/trading_models.md). Using judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md), they could select data exclusively from the [technology sector](../t/technology_sector.md), allowing their algorithms to become highly specialized and efficient in trading tech [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### Implementing Judgmental Sampling

Implementing judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves several steps:

1. **Define Objectives**: Clearly define the objectives of the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) and what specific [market](../m/market.md) conditions or securities you are interested in.
2. **Criteria Selection**: Develop criteria for selecting data points based on your objectives. This could involve financial metrics, [market](../m/market.md) events, or historical [performance indicators](../p/performance_indicators.md).
3. **Data Collection and [Sampling](../s/sampling.md)**: Collect the data and apply your judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) criteria to extract the most relevant subset.
4. **Model Training and Testing**: Use the sampled data to train your [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). Ensure you evaluate the performance with [out-of-sample testing](../o/out-of-sample_testing.md) to avoid [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md).
5. **Adjustment and Iteration**: Continuously monitor the performance and adjust your [sampling](../s/sampling.md) criteria as necessary.

### Conclusion

Judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) is a critical technique in the toolbox of algorithmic traders, [offering](../o/offering.md) a way to tailor datasets to fit specific strategies and insights. While it comes with risks such as bias and lack of generalizability, these can be mitigated through [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) and careful implementation. As [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) continues to evolve, judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) [will](../w/will.md) remain a valuable method for traders and analysts looking to [gain](../g/gain.md) a competitive edge.

By understanding and applying judgmental [sampling](../s/sampling.md) effectively, trading firms can create more [robust](../r/robust.md) algorithms, optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and ultimately achieve better performance in the markets.
