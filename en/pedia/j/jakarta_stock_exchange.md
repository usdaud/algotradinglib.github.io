Situated in Jakarta, the [capital](../c/capital.md) city of Indonesia, IDX is a pivotal institution in the Southeast Asian financial landscape. The Jakarta Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), before its [merger](../m/merger.md), played a crucial role in the development of Indonesia's financial systems and [market](../m/market.md) regulations. This comprehensive analysis unfolds the historical evolution, structural framework, trading mechanisms, [market](../m/market.md) indices, and overall role of the Jakarta Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) in the algotrading context.

## Historical Evolution

The Jakarta Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) traces its roots back to December 1912, when it was established by the Dutch during the colonial period. Initially, its primary operations were modest, focusing on trading [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds from Dutch companies operating in the Dutch East Indies. However, activities were halted during World War II and did not [resume](../r/resume.md) until 1977, driven by the Indonesian government's initiatives under President Suharto.

### Revival and Growth

Under the supervision of the [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Supervisory Agency (Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal, Bapepam), the JSX was relaunched with the aim of developing the Indonesian [capital](../c/capital.md) [market](../m/market.md). The revival phase saw significant steps such as:

- **Introduction of Automated Trading System (ATS):** In 1995, to enhance trading [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md), JSX transitioned from manual trading methods to the Automated Trading System, marking a revolutionary technological shift. This system supported [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md), enhancing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [market depth](../m/market_depth.md).
- **Financial Reforms and [Deregulation](../d/deregulation.md):** The Indonesian government introduced several reforms aimed at deregulating the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), encouraging [foreign investment](../f/foreign_investment.md), and enhancing [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) standards.

### Merger and Formation of IDX

On December 1, 2007, the Jakarta Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) merged with the Surabaya Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) to form the Indonesia Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (IDX). This [merger](../m/merger.md) aimed to unify the trading platforms and streamline operations, thus creating a more [robust](../r/robust.md) and competitive marketplace. The IDX continues to inherit the legacy and operations of the JSX, including its automated systems conducive to algotrading.
