# JAX

JAX is a high-performance numerical computing library developed by Google, designed for high-performance [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) research. It extends the NumPy API with automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration on GPUs and TPUs.

### Key Components
- **NumPy API Compatibility:** Offers familiar array operations with high performance.
- **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd):** Allows for efficient gradient computations.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:** Speeds up computations by compiling Python functions to optimized machine code.
- **Parallelization:** Supports parallel processing across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) devices.

### Applications
- **Research Prototyping:** Rapid experimentation in numerical and scientific computing.
- **[Deep Learning](../d/deep_learning.md):** Building custom neural network architectures with high [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).
- **[Optimization](../o/optimization.md):** Solving complex [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems with fast gradient computations.
- **[Simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md) and Modeling:** High-speed computations for scientific simulations.

### Advantages
- High performance through JIT compilation and hardware acceleration.
- Seamless integration with NumPy makes it accessible to many researchers.
- Excellent for rapid prototyping and scaling research experiments.

### Challenges
- Steeper [learning curve](../l/learning_curve.md) for users not familiar with functional programming.
- Debugging JIT-compiled code can be challenging.
- Limited high-level abstractions compared to frameworks like [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md) or [PyTorch](../p/pytorch.md).

### Future Outlook
JAX is rapidly gaining popularity in the research community, and its ecosystem is growing. Future developments [will](../w/will.md) likely improve its ease-of-use and integration with other [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) libraries, further establishing it as a core tool for advanced numerical computing.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for JAX and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating JAX as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For JAX, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying JAX. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use JAX alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
