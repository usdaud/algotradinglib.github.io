# Japanese Candlestick Chart

A Japanese candlestick chart is a price chart that shows open, high, low, and close for each time period. Each candlestick has a body and wicks that display the range of trading during the period.

## Structure
- The body shows the range between open and close.
- The wicks show the high and low.
- A filled body often indicates a close below the open, while a hollow body indicates a close above the open.

## Why it is useful
Candlesticks make it easy to see momentum, volatility, and intraday rejection. Patterns such as doji, hammer, engulfing, and shooting star are used to interpret market sentiment.

## Example
A long bullish candle with a small upper wick shows strong buying pressure. A doji after a trend can signal indecision and a possible reversal.

## Practical notes
Candlestick patterns work best when combined with trend context and volume. A single candle is not a complete signal by itself.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Japanese Candlestick Chart and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Japanese Candlestick Chart as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Japanese Candlestick Chart, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Japanese Candlestick Chart. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Japanese Candlestick Chart alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
