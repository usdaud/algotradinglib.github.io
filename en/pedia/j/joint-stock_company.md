# Joint-Stock Company

## Definition and Characteristics

A [Joint](../j/joint.md)-Stock Company (JSC) is a [business](../b/business.md) entity where different [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be bought and owned by shareholders. Each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) owns a portion of the company’s stock in proportion, evidenced by their [shares](../s/shares.md) (certificates of ownership). The ownership structure provides a clear demarcation between owners (shareholders) and managers, setting the foundation for [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).

JSCs are characterized by:
- **Separate Legal Entity**: They have an identity separate from their shareholders. They can enter into contracts, acquire assets, incur liabilities, sue, and be sued in their name.
- **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) [Liability](../l/liability.md)**: The [liability](../l/liability.md) of shareholders for the company's debts is usually limited to the [value](../v/value.md) of their [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **Perpetual Succession**: The company's existence is not affected by changes in ownership or the death of shareholders.
- **Transferability of [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: [Shares](../s/shares.md) can typically be transferred without requiring the consent of other shareholders, facilitating the trading of [shares](../s/shares.md) through stock exchanges.
- **Corporate Management**: Managed by elected boards of directors and other appointed managers rather than by shareholders directly.

## History and Evolution

### Early Origins

The concept of a [joint](../j/joint.md)-stock company can be traced back to ancient Rome, but the modern form began to take shape in Europe during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. One of the earliest examples is the English East India Company, established in 1600.

### The 17th to 19th Centuries

During the 17th century, [joint](../j/joint.md)-stock companies became vehicles for colonial and trading enterprises. Notable entities included the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Hudson's Bay Company. These companies played a crucial role in the [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of [trade](../t/trade.md) and the establishment of colonial empires.

The [industrial revolution](../i/industrial_revolution.md) further spurred the growth of JSCs as large amounts of [capital](../c/capital.md) were needed to [finance](../f/finance.md) railways, [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), and other industrial activities. The concept of [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) became more formalized, encouraging more people to invest.

### 20th Century to Present

The 20th century saw the [globalization](../g/globalization.md) of economies and increased trading of [shares](../s/shares.md) on stock exchanges. Modern JSCs operate under stringent regulatory environments to protect investors and maintain [market](../m/market.md) integrity. Digital transformation and advancements in technology have revolutionized the way JSCs operate and [trade](../t/trade.md) [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Formation and Structure
