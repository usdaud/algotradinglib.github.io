# Jump Gap

A jump gap is a sudden price gap that occurs when price jumps from one level to another without trading in between. It often follows a sharp catalyst or a sudden order imbalance.

## Causes
- Breaking news or surprise announcements.
- Large market orders that sweep the book.
- Thin liquidity that cannot absorb demand.

## Trading implications
Jump gaps can act like breakaway gaps if they lead to sustained momentum. They can also be partially filled if the move was driven by temporary imbalance rather than fundamental change.

## Example
A stock trades at 30 and then opens at 33 after unexpected news. The gap between 30 and 33 is a jump gap. Traders watch whether price holds above 33 or fills back toward 30.

## Risks
Trading jump gaps is risky due to volatility and fast price movement. Slippage and wide spreads are common.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Jump Gap and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Jump Gap as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Jump Gap, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Jump Gap. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Jump Gap alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
