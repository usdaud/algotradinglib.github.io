## Overview and History
JCR was founded in April 1985. Since its inception, it has grown to become one of the leading [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies in Japan. The agency's primary mission is to promote the sound development of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) through the [provision](../p/provision.md) of reliable and accurate [credit](../c/credit.md) information. This objective is achieved through thorough analysis and an in-depth understanding of both the local and global economic environments.

The agency’s immense growth can be attributed to its vast knowledge of the Japanese [market](../m/market.md), alongside its methodical and consistent approach to [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) evaluation. JCR issues ratings on a broad spectrum of financial instruments including corporate bonds, government bonds, regional bonds, [structured finance](../s/structured_finance.md) products, and more. 

## Regulatory Framework
JCR operates under a stringent regulatory framework that ensures its ratings are both reliable and unbiased. In Japan, [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies are regulated by the Financial Services Agency (FSA). The stringent oversight by the FSA guarantees that JCR adheres to the highest standards of [transparency](../t/transparency.md), accountability, and accuracy in its [rating](../r/rating.md) processes. 

Additionally, JCR is a member of the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) and the Association for [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) [Securitization](../s/securitization.md) (ARES), which further underlines its commitment to ethical practices and [market](../m/market.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

## Rating Methodology
JCR employs a meticulous and multifaceted approach to [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md). Its methodology combines both quantitative and qualitative analyses, which are crucial in evaluating an entity’s ability to repay its [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). The methodology generally encompasses:

1. **[Financial Analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md)**: This includes the examination of [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), [liquidity ratios](../l/liquidity_ratios.md), [profitability ratios](../p/profitability_ratios.md), [leverage](../l/leverage.md), and [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) analyses.
  
2. **[Business](../b/business.md) Analysis**: Evaluation of the entity's [business](../b/business.md) model, [industry](../i/industry.md) position, [market share](../m/market_share.md), competitive landscape, and management effectiveness.
  
3. **Economic Environment**: Assessment of macroeconomic conditions, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, regulatory changes, and geopolitical factors that could affect the entity's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).
  
4. **[Corporate Governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and Management**: Evaluation of the company's governance structure, ethics, and the experience and competency of its management team.

JCR’s ratings [range](../r/range.md) from [AAA](../a/aaa.md), which represents the highest level of [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md), to D, indicating [default](../d/default.md). Intermediate ratings such as AA, A, and BBB denote varying degrees of [credit](../c/credit.md) quality and [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Expertise in Local Market
One of JCR's notable strengths is its profound understanding of the Japanese [market](../m/market.md). This local expertise allows JCR to provide more accurate and contextually relevant assessments compared to international ratings agencies. The agency’s judgments incorporate a granular understanding of the Japanese [corporate culture](../c/corporate_culture.md), regulatory environment, and localized economic phenomena.

For instance, JCR has specialized ratings criteria for sectors that are particularly significant in Japan, such as [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), and [finance](../f/finance.md). This sector-specific knowledge is critical for investors who require nuanced insights into the Japanese [market](../m/market.md).

## International Recognition

Moreover, JCR’s ratings are acknowledged by foreign regulatory bodies, highlighting its credibility and the robustness of its methodology.

JCR has established partnerships with several international [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies to enhance its global reach. These collaborations facilitate the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of knowledge and augment JCR’s ability to evaluate cross-border financial instruments comprehensively.
