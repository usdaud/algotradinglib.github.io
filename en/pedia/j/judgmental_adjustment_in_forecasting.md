# Judgmental Adjustment in Forecasting

Judgmental adjustment refers to the modification of statistical forecasts based on human intuition, expertise, or domain-specific knowledge. This process is particularly important in fields where experts believe that the statistical models alone cannot capture all the intricacies of the real-world phenomena they aim to predict. Judgmental adjustments can either complement or override purely data-driven models, enabling forecasters to incorporate additional information that may not be present in the historical data.

## Importance in Forecasting

While statistical models can process vast amounts of data and identify patterns that may not be visible to the human eye, they have limitations. Models are inherently backward-looking, deriving their predictions from historical data. This reliance on historical data means that they can struggle to account for unprecedented events or future changes in circumstances. Human judgment, however, can fill these gaps by incorporating insights from recent developments, expected policy changes, or emerging trends that are not reflected in historical data.

## Application Areas

Judgmental adjustment is used across various domains:
- **Financial Markets:** Traders might adjust forecasts of stock prices based on recent news that hasn't yet been reflected in the data.
- **Supply Chain Management:** Managers might adjust demand forecasts based on upcoming marketing campaigns or new product launches.
- **Weather Forecasting:** Meteorologists might modify computer-generated weather predictions based on recent observations or knowledge about unique local patterns.
  
## Techniques

There are several methods for integrating judgmental adjustments:

### Intuition-Based Adjustment
This involves modifying forecasts based on gut feelings or intuition. Experts might rely on their experience to make slight adjustments to model-based forecasts.

### Structured Judgment
More systematic, this approach involves rules and criteria to adjust forecasts. Methods like Delphi techniques or scenario planning can formalize how expert judgments are integrated into forecasts.

### Hybrid Models
Hybrid models combine statistical methods with expert input. Machine learning algorithms might incorporate human adjustments as additional features in the model.

## Challenges

Despite their usefulness, judgmental adjustments come with challenges:

### Bias
Human judgment is susceptible to biases like overconfidence, anchoring, and availability heuristic. These can lead to systematic errors in adjustments.

### Lack of Transparency
Unlike statistical models, judgmental adjustments can be opaque, making it difficult to understand how final forecasts were derived.

### Consistency
Judgmental adjustments can vary significantly between different experts, leading to inconsistencies in forecasts.

### Quantifying Impact
Measuring the benefit of judgmental adjustments can be challenging. It can be hard to attribute [forecast accuracy](../f/forecast_accuracy.md) to either the statistical model or the human input.

## Case Studies

### Financial Markets
In the financial industry, companies like Renaissance Technologies have leveraged both [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and human expertise. Employing a cadre of Ph.D.s in various scientific disciplines, they build robust models but also consider judgmental adjustments to account for events like [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md), [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md), etc. [Renaissance Technologies](https://www.rentech.com/)

### Supply Chain Management
Companies like Amazon use complex algorithms for [demand forecasting](../d/demand_forecasting.md) but still involve human oversight to account for variables like promotional activities, holidays, or economic shifts. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)

### Weather Forecasting
The National Weather Service (NWS) uses sophisticated meteorological models but allows seasoned meteorologists to make adjustments based on real-time observations and unique local weather patterns. [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/)

## Methods for Evaluating Judgmental Adjustments

To quantify the effectiveness of judgmental adjustments, different methodologies can be employed:
- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md):** Comparing predictions with and without adjustments against actual outcomes.
- **Real-world Experiments:** Implementing and monitoring outcomes to measure predictive accuracy.
- **Error Metrics:** Utilizing statistical error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root [Mean Squared Error](../m/mean_squared_error.md) (RMSE) to compare performance.

## Best Practices

### Training
Provide comprehensive training to improve the quality of judgmental inputs. Training can focus on identifying biases, understanding model limitations, and leveraging domain knowledge effectively.

### Systematic Approach
Adopt a structured approach for integrating judgmental adjustments. Consistently apply rules and criteria to ensure uniformity.

### Continuous Improvement
Regularly review and refine the adjustment process. Incorporate feedback loops to understand the impact and effectiveness of human inputs.

### Documentation
Thoroughly document the reasons for each adjustment. Transparency ensures that future adjustments benefit from historical context and rationales.

## Future Trends

### AI and Human Collaboration
Future advancements may see tighter integration between machine learning models and human judgment. AI can assist by flagging when human inputs are likely needed, or by learning from past judgmental adjustments to improve its own future recommendations.

### Real-time Data
The influx of real-time data sources can enhance judgmental adjustments by providing up-to-date information that models might not yet incorporate. Fields like IoT can offer immediate data feeds to shape short-term forecasts significantly.

### Enhanced Visualization
Sophisticated visualization tools can help human forecasters make better adjustments by providing clearer insights into both model predictions and the underlying data trends.

## Conclusion

Judgmental adjustment in forecasting remains a vital process across multiple domains, striking a balance between [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and human intuition. While challenges exist, adopting best practices and leveraging advancements in AI and [data visualization](../d/data_visualization.md) can enhance the efficacy and accuracy of this approach.
