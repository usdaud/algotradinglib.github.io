# Japanese Candlestick Patterns

Japanese [candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md) are a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool used by traders to predict future price movements of financial assets. These patterns are rooted in the historical techniques used in Japanese rice trading and have been refined over time. They are visually depicted as individual candles on a price chart, with each candle representing a specific time period. The [candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md) are a crucial aspect of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) in trading because they help traders to interpret [market](../m/market.md) psychology and sentiment, providing insights into potential price reversals or continuations.

## Structure of a Candlestick

A [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) consists of four primary components:
1. **[Open](../o/open.md)**: The [opening price](../o/opening_price.md) during the specified time period.
2. **Close**: The closing price during the specified time period.
3. **High**: The highest price reached during the specified time period.
4. **Low**: The lowest price reached during the specified time period.

### Candlestick Bodies and Shadows
- **Body**: The rectangular area between the [open](../o/open.md) and close prices. When the close is higher than the [open](../o/open.md), the body is filled or colored green/white. When the close is lower than the [open](../o/open.md), it's filled or colored red/black.
- **Upper Shadow (Wick)**: The line extending from the top of the body to the high of the period.
- **Lower Shadow (Tail)**: The line extending from the bottom of the body to the low of the period.

## Key Candlestick Patterns

[Candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md) are broadly categorized into two types based on their predictive [value](../v/value.md): **bullish** and **bearish**. Each pattern provides significant insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and potential future price movements.

### Bullish Patterns

1. **Hammer**
 - **Description**: A hammer is characterized by a small body near the top of the trading [range](../r/range.md) with a long lower shadow.
 - **Interpretation**: It suggests a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) from a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) to an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), indicating that buyers are stepping in after a period of selling pressure.

2. **Bullish Engulfing**

## Continuation Patterns

Apart from [reversal patterns](../r/reversal_patterns.md), there are also [continuation patterns](../c/continuation_patterns.md) that indicate the ongoing [trend](../t/trend.md) [will](../w/will.md) likely continue.

1. **Rising Three Methods**
 - **Description**: This pattern has a long bullish candle followed by a series of smaller bearish or [neutral](../n/neutral.md) candles, and ending with another long bullish candle. The small candles stay within the [range](../r/range.md) of the first and last candles.
 - **Interpretation**: It indicates a brief [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) before the [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) continues.
 -!Rising Three Methods Pattern

2. **Falling Three Methods**
 - **Description**: This pattern has a long bearish candle followed by a series of smaller bullish or [neutral](../n/neutral.md) candles, and ending with another long bearish candle. The small candles stay within the [range](../r/range.md) of the first and last candles.
 - **Interpretation**: It indicates a brief [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) before the [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) continues.
 -!Falling Three Methods Pattern

## Indecision Patterns

Indecision patterns usually signal that the [market](../m/market.md) [will](../w/will.md) move in one direction after a period of indecision.

1. **[Doji](../d/doji.md)**
 - **Description**: A [doji](../d/doji.md) candle has an almost invisible body with [open](../o/open.md) and close prices being virtually equal, and long shadows.
 - **Interpretation**: It indicates indecision in the [market](../m/market.md), often signaling potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points when appearing after a strong [trend](../t/trend.md).
 -!Doji Pattern

2. **Spinning Top**
 - **Description**: This pattern has a small body centered between long upper and lower shadows.
 - **Interpretation**: It indicates indecision but with slightly more weight on the potential continuation of the existing [trend](../t/trend.md).
 -!Spinning Top Pattern

## Interpretation of Patterns in Context

While individual [candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md) provide insights, their significance increases when interpreted in the context of overall [market](../m/market.md) behavior. Traders often look for confirmations by combining [candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md) with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, and [volume analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md).

1. **[Volume](../v/volume.md)**: High [volume](../v/volume.md) on pattern confirmation days strengthens the pattern indication.
2. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Lines**: Patterns occurring at key trendlines or support/resistance levels are more reliable.
3. **Moving Averages**: Patterns forming near major moving averages are often significant.
