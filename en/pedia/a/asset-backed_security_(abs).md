# Asset-Backed Security (ABS)

An [asset](../a/asset.md)-backed [security](../s/security.md) (ABS) is a type of financial investment that is collateralized by a pool of assets such as loans, leases, [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [debt](../d/debt.md), royalties, or receivables. Essentially, ABS allows investors to purchase a share in a diversified pool of assets rather than individual loans or receivables, thereby dispersing [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Structure and Components

### Assets
The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets in an ABS can be diverse, but they typically fall into a few categories:

- **Auto Loans**: Loans given to consumers to purchase vehicles.
- **[Credit Card](../c/credit_card.md) Receivables**: [Debt](../d/debt.md) owed by [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) holders.
- **[Home Equity](../h/home_equity.md) Loans**: Loans where the borrows use their [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) as [collateral](../c/collateral.md).
- **Student Loans**: Loans provided to students to cover educational expenses.
- **Small [Business](../b/business.md) Loans**: Loans given to small businesses, often SBA guaranteed.
- **Royalties**: [Income](../i/income.md) from intellectual property or other licensing [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams.

### Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)
An SPV is a separate legal entity created by a company to isolate [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md). In the context of ABS, the SPV buys the assets from the original [lender](../l/lender.md) or originator and structures them into a [security](../s/security.md). The SPV then issues bonds backed by these assets, distributing different [tranches](../t/tranches.md) with varying levels of priority and [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Tranches
ABS are often divided into segments called [tranches](../t/tranches.md), each representing a different level of [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md). The [tranches](../t/tranches.md) are typically termed as:

- **Senior [Tranches](../t/tranches.md)**: These are the least risky and have the highest [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md).
- **Mezzanine [Tranches](../t/tranches.md)**: These [offer](../o/offer.md) higher returns than senior [tranches](../t/tranches.md) but come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **[Equity](../e/equity.md) [Tranches](../t/tranches.md)**: These are the riskiest and have the highest potential returns.

### Credit Enhancement
To make ABS more attractive to investors, originators often implement [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancement techniques such as:
- **Overcollateralization**: Involves issuing fewer securities than the [value](../v/value.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.
- **Reserve Funds**: A portion of the [asset](../a/asset.md) cash flows is set aside to cover defaults.
- **Subordination**: Lower [tranches](../t/tranches.md) absorb losses before higher [tranches](../t/tranches.md), providing a cushion for senior [tranches](../t/tranches.md).

## Process of Securitization

### Step 1: Asset Pooling
The originator bundles together a pool of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. This [diversification](../d/diversification.md) helps mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with individual defaults.

### Step 2: Transfer to SPV
The pooled assets are transferred to an SPV. The SPV isolates these assets from the originator's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), protecting them from the originator's [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md).

### Step 3: Issuance of Securities
The SPV issues ABS to investors. These securities entitle investors to a portion of the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) generated by the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

### Step 4: Servicing
The originator often continues to service the loans—collecting payments, maintaining records, and handling delinquencies—but the cash flows are directed to the SPV, which then distributes payments to investors.

## Benefits of ABS

### For Originators
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Relief**: By selling assets to an SPV, originators can offload liabilities and free up [capital](../c/capital.md) for other lending activities.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Originators can manage and transfer [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the loans to a broader base of investors.

### For Investors
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Investors [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to a diversified pool of assets, reducing the impact of individual [asset](../a/asset.md) defaults.
- **Regular Cash Flows**: ABS typically provide a steady stream of [income](../i/income.md) from the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.
- **Customizable [Risk](../r/risk.md)/[Return](../r/return.md) Profile**: Through [tranches](../t/tranches.md), investors can choose the level of [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) that matches their [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md).

## Risks of ABS

### Credit Risk
This is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the borrowers of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) loans [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md). Various forms of [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancement are designed to mitigate this [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Prepayment Risk
Especially relevant in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (a subset of ABS), [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) occurs when borrowers pay off their loans early, affecting the expected [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) to investors.

### Interest Rate Risk
Changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can affect the profitability of the ABS. A rise in rates can lead to a decline in the [value](../v/value.md) of the [security](../s/security.md).

### Regulatory Risk
Changes in regulation can affect the performance and legality of ABS. For instance, regulations post-2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) significantly affected the issuance and structure of ABS.

## ABS Market Development and Trends

The ABS [market](../m/market.md) has evolved significantly since its inception in the late 1980s. Initially driven by securitizations of auto loans, [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) receivables, and [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) loans, the [asset](../a/asset.md)-backed [market](../m/market.md) today includes a much broader array of [asset](../a/asset.md) types.

### Notable Trends

- **[Expansion](../e/expansion.md) into Emerging Markets**: While ABS started in developed economies, there's now a growing [market](../m/market.md) in emerging economies.
- **Digital Transformation**: Technologies like [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) are being explored to increase [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in ABS transactions.
- **Green ABS**: An emerging segment focusing on environmentally friendly projects, such as renewable energy assets.

### Key Players in the ABS Market

- **[Investment Banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md)**: Institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan often serve as underwriters in ABS transactions.
- **[Rating](../r/rating.md) Agencies**: Companies like Moody's, S&P, and Fitch evaluate the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of ABS.
- **Servicers**: These are often the original lenders, responsible for servicing the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) loans.

## Regulations Governing ABS

ABS markets are subject to regulation to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protect investors. Key regulatory frameworks include:

- **U.S. Dodd-Frank Act**: Enacted in response to the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), it includes provisions to improve accountability and [transparency](../t/transparency.md).
- **[Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md)**: A global regulatory framework designed to strengthen [bank capital](../b/bank_capital.md) requirements and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).
- **European [Market](../m/market.md) [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) Regulation (EMIR)**: Focuses on increasing the stability of the OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md), affecting synthetic ABS.

## Conclusion

[Asset](../a/asset.md)-backed securities [offer](../o/offer.md) a means for financial institutions to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md), while providing investors with diverse and customizable investment opportunities. Despite the complexity and risks involved, ABS remain a significant component of the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). With ongoing developments in technology and regulation, the [market](../m/market.md) for ABS continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities and challenges for [market](../m/market.md) participants. As always, understanding the structure, risks, and rewards associated with these securities is critical for both issuers and investors.
