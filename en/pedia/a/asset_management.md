# Asset Management

[Asset](../a/asset.md) management refers to the systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets in a cost-effective manner. The term is most often used in the financial and investment sectors to describe the management of investments on behalf of clients. However, [asset](../a/asset.md) management as a concept can also be applied to physical assets such as [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), buildings, machinery, and equipment. This article focuses on [asset](../a/asset.md) management within the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md), where it plays a crucial role in generating [wealth](../w/wealth.md) for individual and institutional investors.

## Financial Asset Management

In [finance](../f/finance.md), [asset](../a/asset.md) management primarily involves the management of investment portfolios, which can include a wide [range](../r/range.md) of assets including [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), commodities, and other financial instruments. [Financial asset](../f/financial_asset.md) managers aim to achieve the best possible [return](../r/return.md) on investment while managing [risk](../r/risk.md) to acceptable levels. This is achieved through diverse strategies, including [active management](../a/active_management.md), passive management, and a combination of both.

### Investment Strategies

#### Active Management

[Active management](../a/active_management.md) is an approach where the [asset](../a/asset.md) manager makes specific investments with the goal of outperforming an investment [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md). This strategy involves continuous monitoring of the [market](../m/market.md), in-depth research, and a high level of involvement in [order](../o/order.md) to make buy, [hold](../h/hold.md), and sell decisions. [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers employing this strategy often use a variety of tools and techniques, including [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), and macroeconomic analysis. Despite the potential for high returns, [active management](../a/active_management.md) usually comes with higher fees and may also involve higher levels of [risk](../r/risk.md).

#### Passive Management

Passive management involves creating a portfolio designed to mirror the performance of a specific [index](../i/index_instrument.md), such as the S&P 500 or the FTSE 100. This approach is based on the [efficient market hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md), which suggests that it is difficult to consistently [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the [market](../m/market.md) due to its inherent [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). Passive management typically involves lower fees and lower [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) because it requires fewer trades. [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs) and [index](../i/index_instrument.md) funds are examples of investment vehicles commonly used in passive management strategies.

#### Hybrid Strategies

Many [asset](../a/asset.md) managers employ a combination of active and passive strategies to balance potential returns with [risk](../r/risk.md) and cost. For example, a manager might use a passive strategy for a core portfolio while actively managing a portion of the assets to take advantage of specific opportunities in the [market](../m/market.md).

### Asset Allocation

[Asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) is the process of deciding how to distribute a portfolio's assets among different [asset](../a/asset.md) categories, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and cash. The allocation depends on the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), investment goals, and [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md). Effective [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) is critical for balancing [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) and achieving long-term investment success.

#### Strategic Asset Allocation

Strategic [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) involves setting a target mix of assets based on an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s long-term goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md). This mix is typically reviewed periodically and adjusted as needed to maintain the desired [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md). The strategy aims to balance [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) over an extended period.

#### Tactical Asset Allocation

Tactical [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) involves taking short-term positions to exploit [market](../m/market.md) opportunities or to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against risks. This approach requires a more [active management](../a/active_management.md) style and could involve moving assets between different categories based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions or economic outlook.

### Risk Management

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is essential in [asset](../a/asset.md) management to protect the [value](../v/value.md) of investments and achieve desired returns. [Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks followed by coordinated application of resources to minimize and control their impact.

#### Types of Investment Risk

- **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) of losses due to changes in [market](../m/market.md) prices.
- **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) that a borrower [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md) on any type of [debt](../d/debt.md).
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) that an [investor](../i/investor.md) may not be able to buy or sell assets quickly without substantial price changes.
- **[Operational Risk](../o/operational_risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people, and systems.
- **[Regulatory Risk](../r/regulatory_risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) of regulatory changes that could affect the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s profitability.

### Performance Measurement

Performance measurement in [asset](../a/asset.md) management involves evaluating the performance of investment portfolios to determine whether they meet their objectives. Common methods for assessing performance include comparing returns to benchmarks, [peer group](../p/peer_group.md) comparisons, and analyzing [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

#### Key Metrics

- **[Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md):** The percentage [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss on an investment over a specified period.
- **[Alpha](../a/alpha.md):** A measure of an investment's performance relative to a [market index](../m/market_index.md).
- **[Beta](../b/beta.md):** A measure of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [volatility](../v/volatility.md) relative to the overall [market](../m/market.md).
- **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md):** A measure of [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md), calculated by dividing an investment's [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) by its [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md).
