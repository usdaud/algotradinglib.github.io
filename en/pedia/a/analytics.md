# Analytics

Analytics in trading turns raw data into actionable insight for strategy design, execution, and oversight. It supports decision making by quantifying performance, risk, and operational behavior.

## Types of Analytics
Descriptive analytics summarize what happened. Diagnostic analytics explain why it happened. Predictive analytics estimate what may happen next. Prescriptive analytics recommend actions based on expected outcomes.

## Core Performance Metrics
Common metrics include return, volatility, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, win rate, and profit factor. Attribution analysis breaks performance into sources such as signal contribution, execution costs, and timing decisions.

## Risk Analytics
Risk analytics focus on exposure, concentration, correlation, and tail risk. Stress testing and scenario analysis help reveal vulnerabilities that are not obvious in average performance numbers.

## Execution and Operational Analytics
Execution analytics measure slippage, market impact, fill rates, and routing quality. Operational analytics track data quality, system uptime, and latency. These metrics explain the difference between theoretical and realized performance.

## Reporting and Monitoring
Dashboards and automated reports provide timely visibility. Alerts should highlight limit breaches, abnormal volatility, or degraded execution quality. Consistent reporting supports accountability and continuous improvement.

## Conclusion
Strong analytics transform trading from intuition into a measurable process. They are essential for scaling strategies and maintaining discipline.
