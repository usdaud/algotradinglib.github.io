# Agency by Necessity

Agency by necessity is a legal doctrine that permits someone, typically an agent, to take action on behalf of another party without their explicit consent due to urgent and unavoidable circumstances. This principle is particularly relevant in scenarios where immediate decisions or actions are required to protect the interests or rights of the [principal](../p/principal.md) (the individual or entity being represented). In the context of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), understanding agency by necessity can be crucial, as it may guide the decisions made by brokers or automated systems when unforeseen situations arise.

## Overview of Agency by Necessity

Agency by necessity arises from [common law](../c/common_law.md), which recognizes that, under specific exigent circumstances, an agent can act unilaterally for the benefit of the [principal](../p/principal.md) to prevent harm or loss. The three primary conditions that typically justify the application of this doctrine are:

1. **Existence of an Emergency**: There must be a pressing situation that threatens imminent harm or significant loss to the [principal](../p/principal.md).
2. **Impossibility of Genuine Communication**: The agent must be unable to communicate with the [principal](../p/principal.md) in time to receive explicit instructions.
3. **Best Interests of the [Principal](../p/principal.md)**: The actions taken by the agent must be necessary and in the best interests of the [principal](../p/principal.md).

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), agency by necessity might come into play when [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) need to respond to real-time [market](../m/market.md) conditions that could not be anticipated by pre-written algorithms. For instance, if a system detects a sudden [market](../m/market.md) crash or other irregularities, it may execute trades or [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) positions to protect the portfolio from catastrophic losses, even if prior explicit consent from the [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md) is not in place.

### Key Principles

1. **Dynamic Decision-Making**: Algorithms must be equipped to make rapid decisions in the face of [market](../m/market.md) abnormalities. These decisions should aim to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md) and preserve the [value](../v/value.md) of the assets under management.
   
2. **Fallback Protocols**: [Trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) should incorporate fallback protocols that allow for pre-approved emergency measures. These might include auto-[liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) rules or preset protective trades.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Actions taken by an automated system under the doctrine of agency by necessity must comply with existing financial regulations. Such compliance ensures the legality and ethicality of the measures.

## Legal Precedents and Case Studies

### Historical Examples

Several legal cases illustrate the application of agency by necessity. For instance, in [maritime law](../m/maritime_law.md), a ship's captain might sell cargo to repair a vessel and ensure the safe continuation of the voyage. Another classic scenario involves emergency medical decisions made by a caregiver in the absence of the patientâ€™s legal guardian.

### Modern Financial Context

Modern applications in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) include instances where brokers must act swiftly during [market](../m/market.md) disruptions. For example, during the 2010 Flash Crash, [high-frequency trading algorithms](../h/high-frequency_trading_algorithms.md) executed numerous orders in milliseconds to stabilize client portfolios. These actions, while controversial, underscore the critical need for automated systems to have [contingency](../c/contingency.md) plans.

## Implementation Strategies

### Building Robust Algorithms

Developers of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) should ensure that:

- **Versatile [Heuristics](../h/heuristics.md)**: The algorithms are equipped with versatile [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md) capable of identifying various emergency scenarios.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: There are built-in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) protocols that can override normal trading behaviors during crises.
- **Automation of Emergency Contacts**: Systems should be able to attempt automated communication with relevant stakeholders before taking unilateral actions, adhering as closely as possible to standard operating procedures.

### Training and Documentation

Financial institutions implementing such algorithms need:

- **Regular Training**: Regular training sessions for traders and [risk](../r/risk.md) managers to understand the potential actions of automated systems during emergencies.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation of the algorithm's emergency protocols and the legal frameworks supporting them, ensuring clarity and accountability.

## Ethical Considerations

### Client Consent

While the doctrine allows for unilateral action, ongoing efforts should be made to secure prior client consent for emergency measures, emphasizing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and client [trust](../t/trust.md).

### Minimizing Negative Impact

Algorithms should aim to minimize any adverse effects on the [market](../m/market.md) and other participants when executing emergency measures. Ethical considerations should guide the development and refinement of these systems to prevent misuse or overreach.

## Future Directions

### Technological Advancements

Advancements in [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) could further enhance the capability of [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) to act under the doctrine of agency by necessity. [Predictive analytics](../p/predictive_analytics.md) might improve emergency response times and accuracy.

### Regulatory Evolution

As markets evolve, so too [will](../w/will.md) regulatory frameworks overseeing automated trading activities. Continuous dialogue between regulators, financial institutions, and technology providers [will](../w/will.md) be essential to ensure that the principles underpinning agency by necessity are upheld in the digital age.

### Collaboration with Regulatory Bodies

Proactively engaging with regulatory bodies to shape policies that accommodate the complexities of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) while protecting [investor](../i/investor.md) interests [will](../w/will.md) be crucial. This collaborative approach can help build a resilient and adaptive financial ecosystem.

## Companies Implementing Agency by Necessity

Several companies and trading platforms are known for their advanced [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems that incorporate aspects of agency by necessity:

## Conclusion

Agency by necessity in the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) represents a crucial intersection of legal doctrine, technological capability, and ethical responsibility. As markets continue to evolve and technology advances, the principles guiding these emergency measures [will](../w/will.md) need to adapt, ensuring that they continue to serve the best interests of all [market](../m/market.md) participants while upholding regulatory standards and ethical practices. By understanding and implementing [robust](../r/robust.md) strategies that respect the tenets of agency by necessity, financial institutions can better navigate the complexities of modern trading environments.
