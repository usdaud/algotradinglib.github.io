# Alpha Factor

An alpha factor is a measurable characteristic that helps explain or predict returns. Factors translate raw data into signals that can be ranked, combined, and traded.

## Common Factors
Common examples include value, momentum, size, quality, volatility, carry, and liquidity. Each factor captures a different economic or behavioral effect. The relevance of a factor can vary by asset class and market regime.

## Factor Construction
Constructing a factor starts with clean and consistent data. Raw inputs are usually normalized to remove scale effects and to reduce the impact of outliers. Many practitioners neutralize factors by sector, industry, or market beta to isolate the desired exposure.

## Evaluation and Validation
A factor should be tested across long time periods and multiple market conditions. Key checks include the information coefficient, hit rate, turnover, and stability of returns. Sensitivity analysis helps determine whether the factor is robust to small changes in parameters.

## Implementation Considerations
Factor strategies must balance signal strength with trading costs. High turnover factors can suffer from slippage and market impact. Portfolio construction should control for unintended exposures such as sector or size bias.

## Risks
Factors can crowd, leading to abrupt reversals when capital exits. The economic rationale behind a factor can weaken over time as market structure changes. Overfitting remains a constant risk in factor research.

## Conclusion
Alpha factors are building blocks for systematic strategies. Strong factors are grounded in sound logic, tested across regimes, and implemented with cost awareness.
