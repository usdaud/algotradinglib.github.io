# Amortized Bonds

Amortized bonds are a type of [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) [security](../s/security.md) where the [bond](../b/bond.md) [principal](../p/principal.md) (the amount initially lent to the borrower) is gradually paid off over the life of the [bond](../b/bond.md). This means that each [payment](../p/payment.md) made by the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) includes both [interest](../i/interest.md) and a portion of the [principal](../p/principal.md), reducing the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount over time until it is fully repaid by the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md). This is in contrast to traditional bonds, where the [principal](../p/principal.md) is repaid in full at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

## How Amortized Bonds Work

### Principal Repayment

Amortized bonds involve periodic payments that cover both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md). This amortizing process can be structured in various ways:

1. **Level Amortization**: Here, the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [payment](../p/payment.md) schedule is structured so that the total [payment](../p/payment.md) amount remains constant. Initially, a larger portion of each [payment](../p/payment.md) covers [interest](../i/interest.md), with a smaller portion going towards the [principal](../p/principal.md). Over time, as the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance decreases, the [interest](../i/interest.md) portion of the payments diminishes while the [principal](../p/principal.md) portion increases.

2. **Graduated Amortization**: In this format, the [bond](../b/bond.md) may start with lower payments that increase over time. This method might be chosen if the payments align better with the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s expected growth in cash flows.

3. **Bullet Amortization**: This involves paying off the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [principal](../p/principal.md) in one lump sum at a specific point during the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s life, often at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), but it still includes periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.

### Interest Payments

[Interest](../i/interest.md) payments on amortized bonds are typically fixed and included in the periodic payments. The [interest](../i/interest.md) is calculated on the outstanding [principal](../p/principal.md) amount. As the [principal](../p/principal.md) decreases, so does the [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md).

### Amortization Schedule

An [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md) outlines the bonds' [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan, breaking down each periodic [payment](../p/payment.md) into its [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal components](../p/principal_components_in_trading.md). This schedule can help investors understand how the [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) be repaid over time and the amount of [interest](../i/interest.md) they [will](../w/will.md) receive each period.

### Issuers and Investors

- **Issuers**: Corporations, municipalities, and other entities [issue](../i/issue.md) amortized bonds to [finance](../f/finance.md) projects without needing to come up with a lump sum to repay the [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). It provides the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) with a manageable way to spread out payments over time.

- **Investors**: Investors in amortized bonds receive regular cash flows, making these bonds attractive for those looking for steady [income](../i/income.md). These bonds can be less risky compared to zero-coupon bonds, where the [investor](../i/investor.md) risks receiving no payments until [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

## Example of Amortized Bond

Let’s consider a simplified example of an amortized [bond](../b/bond.md):

### Scenario

- **[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)**: $1,000
- **[Coupon Rate](../c/coupon_rate.md)**: 5% per annum
- **[Duration](../d/duration.md)**: 5 years
- **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Frequency**: Annually

### Calculation

1. **Annual [Payment](../p/payment.md) Calculation**:
 Given the [bond](../b/bond.md) is an amortized [bond](../b/bond.md), the payments are calculated to include both [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md). Using an amortization formula, or an [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md) tool, we determine the annual [payment](../p/payment.md):

 ```
 [Payment](../p/payment.md) = P [ r(1+r)^n ] / [ (1+r)^n – 1 ]
 Where:
 P = [Principal](../p/principal.md) ([Face Value](../f/face_value.md)) = $1,000
 r = [Periodic Interest Rate](../p/periodic_interest_rate.md) = 5%
 n = Number of periods = 5
 ```

 Plugging in the values:

 ```
 [Payment](../p/payment.md) = 1000 [ 0.05(1+0.05)^5 ] / [ (1+0.05)^5 – 1 ]
 ≈ $230.97
 ```

 Therefore, the borrower [will](../w/will.md) make annual payments of approximately $230.97.

2. **[Amortization Schedule](../a/amortization.md)**:
 We create an [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md) that breaks down each annual [payment](../p/payment.md) into [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md).

 - **Year 1**:
 - [Interest](../i/interest.md): $1,000 * 5% = $50
 - [Principal](../p/principal.md): $230.97 - $50 = $180.97
 - Remaining [Principal](../p/principal.md): $1,000 - $180.97 = $819.03

 - **Year 2**:
 - [Interest](../i/interest.md): $819.03 * 5% = $40.95
 - [Principal](../p/principal.md): $230.97 - $40.95 = $190.02
 - Remaining [Principal](../p/principal.md): $819.03 - $190.02 = $629.02

 - **Year 3**:
 - [Interest](../i/interest.md): $629.02 * 5% = $31.45
 - [Principal](../p/principal.md): $230.97 - $31.45 = $199.52
 - Remaining [Principal](../p/principal.md): $629.02 - $199.52 = $429.50

 - **Year 4**:
 - [Interest](../i/interest.md): $429.50 * 5% = $21.48
 - [Principal](../p/principal.md): $230.97 - $21.48 = $209.49
 - Remaining [Principal](../p/principal.md): $429.50 - $209.49 = $220.01

 - **Year 5**:
 - [Interest](../i/interest.md): $220.01 * 5% = $11.00
 - [Principal](../p/principal.md): $230.97 - $11.00 = $219.97
 - Remaining [Principal](../p/principal.md): $220.01 - $219.97 = $0.04

 Across five years, the [bond](../b/bond.md) is paid off completely, with [interest](../i/interest.md) costs decreasing each year as the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance goes down.

## Real-World Applications

**[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-Backed Securities (MBS)**: Amortized bonds are common in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities, where the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets are [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans that include both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) payments.

**Corporate Bonds**: Some corporations may [issue](../i/issue.md) amortized bonds to match their [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), spreading out the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) of the [debt](../d/debt.md) in a way that aligns with their [revenue](../r/revenue.md) projections.

**[Municipal Bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md)**: Cities or municipalities that [issue](../i/issue.md) bonds for [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects might prefer amortized bonds to avoid having to come up with a large sum at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Predictable Cash Flows**: Investors receive regular payments that include both [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md), which provides more predictable cash flows.
2. **Reduced [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: With [principal](../p/principal.md) gradually repaid, the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md) on a large lump sum [payment](../p/payment.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md) is minimized.
3. **[Interest Expense](../i/interest_expense.md)**: For issuers, [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md) reduces over time as the outstanding [principal](../p/principal.md) decreases, which might be financially advantageous.

### Disadvantages

1. **Lower [Interest](../i/interest.md) Payments Over Time**: As the [principal](../p/principal.md) decreases, the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments also reduce, which might be less attractive for investors seeking high regular [income](../i/income.md).
2. **Complexity in [Accounting](../a/accounting.md)**: Keeping track of an [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md) can be complex compared to zero-coupon bonds or traditional bonds.

In conclusion, amortized bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique structure that benefits both issuers and investors by providing predictable cash flows and reducing [payment](../p/payment.md) burdens over time. They are widely used in various financial sectors, including mortgages and municipal projects, to manage [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md) more effectively.
