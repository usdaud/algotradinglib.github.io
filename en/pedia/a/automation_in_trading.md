# Automation in Trading

Automation in trading replaces manual steps with repeatable processes across the trading workflow. It covers data handling, research pipelines, execution, reconciliation, and reporting.

## Areas to Automate
Common targets include data collection, data cleaning, signal calculation, portfolio construction, and order execution. Automation can also streamline compliance checks, reconciliation, and end of day reporting.

## Benefits
Automation improves speed, consistency, and auditability. It reduces operational errors and allows teams to focus on research and oversight rather than repetitive tasks.

## Risks and Challenges
Automation introduces dependencies on data quality and system stability. Small errors can scale quickly when processes run unattended. Testing, monitoring, and clear ownership are required to control these risks.

## Best Practices
Use staged rollouts, automated tests, and monitoring alerts. Keep critical overrides and manual controls available. Document workflows and ensure that operational staff can respond quickly to anomalies.

## Conclusion
Automation is a powerful productivity tool, but it must be paired with strong controls to avoid magnifying mistakes.
