# Algorithmic Trading Regulations

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), often referred to as "algo trading," utilizes sophisticated [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and high-speed data analysis to execute trades in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). While these technologies have fostered increased [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), they also bring risks that regulators aim to mitigate. Below is a comprehensive discussion on [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) regulations, spanning [multiple](../m/multiple.md) jurisdictions and regulatory bodies.

## 1. Introduction to Algorithmic Trading Regulations

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), by its nature, can significantly amplify [market](../m/market.md) movements and contribute to [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Recognizing these potential dangers, financial regulatory institutions across the globe have implemented a variety of rules and guidelines to govern and oversee the use of algorithms in trading practices.

## 2. United States Regulations

### 2.1 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

### 3.2 United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)

FCA, although currently departing slightly from ESMA guidelines due to [Brexit](../b/brexit.md), still places strict demands on [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md):

- **Senior Management Arrangements, Systems, and Controls (SYSC)**:
  - **Governance:** Requires adequate systems and controls for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies, including [stress testing](../s/stress_testing_in_trading.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment.
  - **Record Keeping**: Detailed record-keeping of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md)â€™ purpose and functionality, with specific conditions for firms engaged in HFT.

## 4. Asia-Pacific Regulations

### 4.1 Japan

### 4.1.1 Financial Services Agency (FSA)

Japan's Financial Services Agency has implemented rules to enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and stability in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md):

- **Financial Instruments and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Act (FIEA)**:
  - **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) Notification**: Requirements for traders to notify exchanges if they engage in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).
  - **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: [Obligations](../o/obligation.md) for pre-[trade](../t/trade.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) controls and constant monitoring of [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md).
