# Asset Swap

An [asset](../a/asset.md) [swap](../s/swap.md) is a financial [derivative](../d/derivative.md) [transaction](../t/transaction.md) where two parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) cash flows from different financial instruments. This is often done to modify the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) characteristics of their [asset](../a/asset.md) portfolio, optimally manage risks, or potentially exploit [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md). [Asset](../a/asset.md) swaps can combine elements of both [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) and [total return](../t/total_return.md) swaps, depending on the specific terms of the agreement.

## Key Characteristics of Asset Swaps

### 1. Parties Involved
- **Buyer**: The entity seeking to alter the [risk](../r/risk.md)/[return](../r/return.md) profile.
- **Seller**: The entity providing the desired [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) characteristics.

### 2. Components of a Typical Asset Swap
- **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: Often a [bond](../b/bond.md) or other financial [security](../s/security.md).
- **Fixed [Leg](../l/leg.md)**: Typically consists of fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments derived from the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s coupon.
- **Floating [Leg](../l/leg.md)**: Usually pegged to a [market](../m/market.md) [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) like SOFR (which replaced LIBOR in June 2023).

### 3. Pricing Structure
Pricing an [asset](../a/asset.md) [swap](../s/swap.md) involves considering the [value](../v/value.md) of both the [bond](../b/bond.md) and the [swap](../s/swap.md) component.

## Motivations for Asset Swaps

### Yield Enhancement
Traders and investors may engage in [asset](../a/asset.md) swaps to achieve better returns by converting fixed-rate [bond](../b/bond.md) flows into floating-rate flows or vice versa.

### Risk Management
[Hedging interest rate risk](../h/hedging_interest_rate_risk.md) or [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) can be effectively managed by matching the cash flows of assets and liabilities through [asset](../a/asset.md) swaps.

### Regulatory Compliance
Financial institutions might use [asset](../a/asset.md) swaps as a tool to comply with regulatory frameworks without altering the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) structure of their investment portfolios.

## Types of Asset Swaps

### 1. Par Asset Swap
In a par [asset](../a/asset.md) [swap](../s/swap.md), the [bond](../b/bond.md) is swapped at its [nominal value](../n/nominal_value.md). The vanilla structure involves the buyer paying a fixed rate (equal to the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md)) and receiving a floating rate indexed to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) like SOFR.

### 2. Market Asset Swap
In a [market](../m/market.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) [swap](../s/swap.md), the [bond](../b/bond.md) is traded at its current [market value](../m/market_value.md). This helps reflect the real [market](../m/market.md) prices in the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) [exchange](../e/exchange.md), and the [swap](../s/swap.md) is designed accordingly.

### 3. Cross-Currency Swaps
A type of [asset](../a/asset.md) [swap](../s/swap.md) where cash flows are exchanged between different currencies, effectively managing [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) in [international investing](../i/international_investing.md).

## Practical Applications

### Portfolio Management
[Asset](../a/asset.md) swaps provide portfolio managers with the flexibility to adjust their portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md)/[return](../r/return.md) profile without buying or selling the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) bonds.

### Arbitrage Opportunities
Traders can exploit pricing inefficiencies in the [bond market](../b/bond_market.md) versus the [swap](../s/swap.md) [market](../m/market.md), often aiming to lock in [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) profits.

### Liability Management
Corporations and banks might use [asset](../a/asset.md) swaps to align their [debt](../d/debt.md) servicing requirements more closely with their operating cash flows.

## Example

Suppose Company A holds a fixed-rate [bond](../b/bond.md) and expects [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to rise. It can enter into an [asset](../a/asset.md) [swap](../s/swap.md) agreement to receive fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments while paying floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates pegged to SOFR. This allows Company A to benefit if SOFR rates increase, enhancing their overall [yield](../y/yield.md).
