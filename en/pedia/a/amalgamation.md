# Amalgamation

Amalgamation in the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) refers to the integration of various strategies, data sources, and technology platforms to create an optimized trading system. This approach combines the strengths of different trading methodologies to achieve better performance, minimize risks, and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on diverse [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Let's explore the key components and aspects of this amalgamation in detail.

## 1. **Types of Algorithmic Trading Strategies**

1.1 **[Trend Following Strategies](../t/trend_following_strategies.md)**

[Trend following strategies](../t/trend_following_strategies.md) aim to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the continuation of existing [market](../m/market.md) trends. These algorithms typically use [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) like moving averages, the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI), and the [Average Directional Index](../a/average_directional_index_(adx).md) (ADX) to identify trends. A common [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategy is the moving average crossover, where a shorter-term moving average crossing above a longer-term moving average signals a buy, and vice versa for a sell.

1.2 **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) Strategies**

[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies are based on the statistical premise that [asset](../a/asset.md) prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical average or mean over time. These algorithms often use statistical measures like [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) and [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_band.md) to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions. A basic [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategy involves buying when the price is significantly below the historical average and selling when it is above.

1.3 **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) Strategies**

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies exploit price discrepancies between different markets or instruments. Examples include statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), which identifies mispriced securities based on statistical models, and [merger arbitrage](../m/merger_arbitrage.md), which profits from the price differences in the [stocks](../s/stock.md) of merging companies. High-frequency trading (HFT) often employs [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) techniques to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on minute price differences across exchanges.

1.4 **[Market](../m/market.md) Making Strategies**

[Market](../m/market.md) making involves providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the [market](../m/market.md) by continuously quoting buy and sell prices for a particular [asset](../a/asset.md). [Market](../m/market.md) makers earn profits from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md). Algorithmic [market](../m/market.md)-making involves sophisticated algorithms that dynamically adjust quotes based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions, [order](../o/order.md) flow, and [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels to optimize profitability.
