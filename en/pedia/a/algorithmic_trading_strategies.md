# Algorithmic Trading Strategies

## 1. Trend Following Strategies

**[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md)** strategies are among the oldest and simplest [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies. The primary principle behind [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is that prices tend to move in trends, either upward or downward. Algoritms designed for [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies typically rely on [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as moving averages, breakouts, and [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md).

- **Moving Averages**: Moving averages smooth out price data to identify the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md). Simple moving averages (SMA) and exponential moving averages (EMA) are common tools used. A popular [trend](../t/trend.md)-following technique is the Moving Average Crossover, where a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, signaling a buy, or crosses below signaling a sell.

- **Channel Breakouts**: In this strategy, a buy [order](../o/order.md) is triggered when the price breaks above a predetermined resistance level, while a sell [order](../o/order.md) is flagged when it drops below a support level. The Donchian Channel is a quintessential example of this strategy.

- **[Momentum Indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md)**: These indicators measure the velocity of price movements. Popular ones include the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD).

## 2. Mean Reversion Strategies

**[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)** strategies operate on the theory that [asset](../a/asset.md) prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their mean or average levels over time. This can apply to different financial metrics such as price, returns, or even fundamental ratios like P/E ratios.

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Known as "stat-arb", this strategy identifies pricing inefficiencies between assets expected to revert to the mean. For instance, [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md) involves identifying correlated pairs of [stocks](../s/stock.md); when the prices deviate beyond historical norm, the strategy buys the [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) stock and shorts the [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) one.

## 3. Arbitrage Strategies

**[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)** involves taking advantage of price differentials in different markets or forms. It usually requires precise timing and rapid [execution](../e/execution.md)â€”areas where algorithms excel.

- **Spatial [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: This form involves exploiting price differentials in the same [asset](../a/asset.md) across different markets or exchanges. For example, [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) might be sold at a higher price on one [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and bought at a lower price on another.

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: While it often overlaps with [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies, in statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), algorithms look for statistical relationships among various securities, working on the assumption that prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to the statistical mean.

## 4. Market Making Strategies

**[Market](../m/market.md) making** involves providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the [market](../m/market.md) by [offering](../o/offering.md) buy and sell quotes simultaneously. Algorithmic [market](../m/market.md) makers [profit](../p/profit.md) from the spread between the [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices. [Market](../m/market.md)-making algorithms continuously adjust the quotes to maintain desired [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) risks.

## 5. Sentiment Analysis Based Strategies

**[Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md)** strategies use [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP) and other [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) techniques to gauge [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) from news, [social media](../s/social_media.md), and other sources.

- **News-Based Trading**: Algorithms scan news sources like [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) or [Reuters](../r/reuters.md) for [market](../m/market.md)-moving news. If favorable, a buy [order](../o/order.md) might be triggered; if unfavorable, a sell [order](../o/order.md) might be issued.

- **[Social Media Analytics](../s/social_media_analytics.md)**: Algorithms scrape data from [social media](../s/social_media.md) platforms like Twitter or stock forums to analyze public sentiment. Positive sentiment may trigger a buy, whereas negative sentiment may trigger a sell.

## 6. High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

**High-frequency trading** strategies operate at extremely high speeds, executing numerous orders per second. These strategies [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on small price discrepancies and usually involve co-location services to ensure minimal latency. HFT strategies can be complex, often incorporating elements from other [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies but executed within millisecond timeframes.

## 7. Machine Learning and AI-Based Strategies

**[Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md)** and AI-based strategies utilize advanced statistical models and algorithms to predict future price movements. [Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models are trained on historical data and can include regressive models, [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) architectures, reinforcement [learning algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md), and more.

- **[Supervised Learning](../s/supervised_learning.md) Models**: These models are trained on labeled historical data to predict future prices. Examples include [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md), [decision trees](../d/decision_trees.md), and [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md).

- **[Unsupervised Learning](../u/unsupervised_learning.md) Models**: These models look for hidden patterns in the data. [Clustering algorithms](../c/clustering_algorithms.md) such as K-means can identify related groups of assets or [price patterns](../p/price_patterns.md).

- **[Reinforcement Learning](../r/reinforcement_learning.md)**: In this framework, algorithms learn the best actions to take through trial and error, continually updating their strategy to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

## 8. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Strategy

A **VWAP** strategy aims to execute orders around the [Volume](../v/volume.md) [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price for a given period. VWAP is calculated by multiplying all sell transactions by their corresponding volumes and then dividing by the total [volume](../v/volume.md). This strategy helps in minimizing the [market](../m/market.md) impact and achieving closer to average prices.

## 9. Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) Strategy

**TWAP** strategy is similar to VWAP but uses time-segmented data instead. Here, orders are spread evenly across a specific time period. TWAP strategies are useful for large orders that need [execution](../e/execution.md) over time to minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact.

## 10. Implementation Shortfall Strategies

**Implementation [shortfall](../s/shortfall.md)** strategies aim to minimize the difference between the [execution](../e/execution.md) price and the decision price by breaking large orders into smaller chunks. These strategies consider [market](../m/market.md) conditions and use a dynamic approach that adjusts the trading pace.
