# Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

An Automated Teller Machine, commonly referred to as an ATM, is an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic financial transactions without the need of a branch representative or teller. ATMs are known for their convenience and are strategically placed in locations within easy reach of customers, such as in banks, shopping centers, airports, and other public areas. They [offer](../o/offer.md) a wide array of services and have significantly evolved since their inception to become an integral part of the global financial [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).

## History and Evolution

The first mechanical cash dispenser was developed and used by Luther George Simjian in 1960s, but it was the invention by John Shepherd-Barron that is considered the prototype of modern ATMs. Baron's device, installed by Barclays [Bank](../b/bank.md) in London in 1967, allowed customers to withdraw a fixed amount of cash using a special paper [voucher](../v/voucher.md).

As technology advanced, the design and functionality of ATMs saw significant improvements:
1. **Magnetic Stripe Cards**: In the 1970s, the adoption of magnetic stripe cards replaced the paper vouchers, enabling secure storage of [customer](../c/customer.md) account information.
2. **Telecommunication Networks**: By the 1980s, developments in telecommunication networks allowed ATMs to connect to central banking systems, enabling real-time [transaction](../t/transaction.md) processing.
3. **Graphical Interfaces**: In the 1990s, ATMs began incorporating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that made them more user-friendly.
4. **Enhanced [Security](../s/security.md) Features**: The 2000s saw the introduction of advanced [security](../s/security.md) features such as EMV chips, anti-skimming technologies, and biometric authentication.

## How ATMs Work

### Components of an ATM

1. **Card Reader**: Reads the card information using either a magnetic stripe or an embedded chip.
2. **Keypad**: Used by customers to input their Personal Identification Number (PIN) and other [transaction](../t/transaction.md) details.
3. **Screen**: Displays [transaction](../t/transaction.md) [options](../o/options.md) and instructions, often in a graphical user interface.
4. **Cash Dispenser**: Mechanism that dispenses cash in various denominations as requested by the [customer](../c/customer.md).
5. **Receipt Printer**: Prints out [transaction](../t/transaction.md) [receipts](../r/receipt.md) for [customer](../c/customer.md) records.
6. **Communication Board**: Ensures connectivity with the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s central server for authorization and processing of transactions.
7. **[Security](../s/security.md) Components**: Includes cameras, encryption modules, and tamper-resistant construction to ensure the safety and [security](../s/security.md) of both the machine and users.

### Transaction Process

Here is a step-by-step overview of how a typical ATM [transaction](../t/transaction.md) works:

1. **Card Insertion**: The [customer](../c/customer.md) inserts their ATM or [debit](../d/debit.md) card into the card reader.
2. **PIN Entry**: The [customer](../c/customer.md) inputs their PIN using the keypad. This PIN is encrypted and sent to the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s server for verification.
3. **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Selection**: The [customer](../c/customer.md) selects the type of [transaction](../t/transaction.md) they wish to perform, such as [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md), balance inquiry, [fund](../f/fund.md) transfer, etc.
4. **Amount Entry**: If withdrawing cash, the [customer](../c/customer.md) enters the desired amount.
5. **Authorization**: The ATM communicates with the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s central server to verify the [customer](../c/customer.md)'s identity, [check](../c/check.md) [account balance](../a/account_balance.md), and authorize the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
6. **Dispensing Cash**: Upon authorization, the ATM dispenses the requested amount of cash.
7. **Receipt Printing**: The ATM prints a receipt detailing the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
8. **Card Ejection**: Finally, the card is ejected and the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is complete.

## Security Mechanisms

Given the financial nature of transactions, ATMs have a number of [security](../s/security.md) features designed to protect both the user and the banking institution:

1. **Encryption**: All communication between the ATM and the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s server is encrypted to prevent interception and tampering.
2. **PIN Protection**: PINs are crucial for authenticating users, and measures like PIN shuffling, keypads with shields, and encrypted PIN pads help protect PIN entry.
3. **Skimming Devices**: ATMs today are equipped with anti-skimming technology that detects and prevents the attachment of unauthorized card reading devices.
4. **CCTV Cameras**: Most ATMs are monitored by cameras that record transactions, providing evidence in case of fraudulent activity.
5. **Firmware Integrity**: The software running on ATMs is regularly updated and monitored for integrity to prevent malicious attacks and malware infections.
6. **Physical [Security](../s/security.md)**: The machines are constructed with tamper-resistant materials and often contain dye packs to mark stolen cash.

## Types of ATMs

1. **On-site ATMs**: Located within the premises of a [bank](../b/bank.md) branch. They often provide a wider array of services.
2. **Off-site ATMs**: Found in non-banking locations like malls, airports, and convenience stores. These are primarily for basic functions like cash [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md).
3. **Standalone ATMs**: Machines that operate independently and are not affiliated with any particular [bank](../b/bank.md). They often charge higher fees for usage.
4. **Drive-through ATMs**: Convenient for customers to carry out transactions from their vehicles.
5. **Mobile ATMs**: Portable ATMs are used at events or in areas lacking permanent banking facilities.

## Innovations in ATM Technology

As the financial [industry](../i/industry.md) continues to embrace technological advancements, ATMs have also seen numerous innovations:

1. **Biometric ATMs**: These use biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint, facial recognition, or iris scans to verify the identity of the user.
2. **Contactless ATMs**: Allow transactions to be initiated using contactless cards or mobile devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology.
3. **Video Teller ATMs**: Feature [video conferencing](../v/video_conferencing.md) capabilities, allowing customers to interact with a [bank](../b/bank.md) representative in real time.
4. **[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) ATMs**: Also known as BTMs, these allow users to buy and sell [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and other cryptocurrencies.
5. **Smart ATMs**: Equipped with advanced software to allow a wider [range](../r/range.md) of transactions, including [utility](../u/utility.md) bill payments, mobile top-ups, and [check](../c/check.md) deposits.

## Benefits of ATMs

ATMs [offer](../o/offer.md) numerous advantages for both banks and customers:

1. **Convenience**: Customers can access banking services 24/7, not being restricted to the working hours of a physical branch.
2. **Reduced [Bank](../b/bank.md) Crowds**: By handling routine transactions electronically, ATMs reduce the number of customers in [bank](../b/bank.md) branches, streamlining operations.
3. **Cost [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: ATMs reduce the need for staff to conduct routine transactions, lowering operational costs for banks.
4. **Accessibility**: ATMs extend banking services to remote areas where [bank](../b/bank.md) branches might not be viable.
