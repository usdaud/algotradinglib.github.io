This ratio helps assess the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of a company in relation to its [earnings](../e/earnings.md). It is calculated as:

### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E Ratio)
This ratio evaluates the company’s financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md) by comparing its [total liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) to shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md). It is calculated as:

The [current ratio](../c/current_ratio.md) measures the company's ability to meet its short-term [obligations](../o/obligation.md) with its short-term assets. It is calculated as:
\[ \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}} \]
