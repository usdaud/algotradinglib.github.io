# Adjudication

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), often referred to as algo trading, leverages computer algorithms to execute trades on [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) at speeds and frequencies that human traders cannot match. Adjudication, within the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), pertains to the processes and protocols for analyzing, resolving, and finalizing disputes or decisions arising from algorithmic transactions and operations.

## Introduction

In the financial world, adjudication in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) is essential for maintaining [market](../m/market.md) integrity, ensuring compliance with regulations, and enhancing [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence. The adjudication process can address various issues, including [trade](../t/trade.md) discrepancies, regulatory non-compliance, technology failures, and [market](../m/market.md) manipulations. This article explores the intricacies of adjudication within [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), detailing its objectives, processes, key players, and technological innovations to support equitable and efficient decision-making.

## Objectives of Adjudication

### Accuracy in Trade Execution
Accuracy is paramount in algo trading. Algorithms must execute trades precisely based on predefined criteria to ensure [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) and avoid financial losses. Adjudication mechanisms are established to verify the accuracy of these trades and rectify any discrepancies.

### Compliance with Regulations
[Financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) are heavily regulated to prevent [fraud](../f/fraud.md), [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md), and to protect investors. Adjudication ensures that all [trade](../t/trade.md) transactions comply with existing laws and standards set forth by regulatory bodies such as the SEC (Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md)) or ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority).

### Risk Management
With high-frequency trading, the potential for substantial financial loss due to errors or system failures is high. Adjudication frameworks help manage and mitigate these risks by conducting thorough investigations into incidents, ensuring preventive measures are in place, and applying appropriate sanctions if necessary.
