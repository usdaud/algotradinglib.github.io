# Abnormal Return

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), the concept of "abnormal [return](../r/return.md)" is pivotal in gauging the performance of an investment relative to the general [market](../m/market.md) expectations. Abnormal [return](../r/return.md), often denoted as AR, is the difference between the actual [return](../r/return.md) of a [security](../s/security.md) and the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md), given the [risk](../r/risk.md) level and [market](../m/market.md) conditions. It is a key metric that investors and analysts use to determine whether a [security](../s/security.md) has performed better or worse than the [market](../m/market.md) anticipated.

### Understanding Abnormal Return

Abnormal returns arise as a result of an event or a series of events that impact the [value](../v/value.md) of a [security](../s/security.md), separate from the expected [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) values that are forecasted by [market](../m/market.md) models. These models incorporate various [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md) and historical performance data to project the expected returns. When the actual [return](../r/return.md) deviates from this [expected return](../e/expected_return.md), it is termed as an "abnormal [return](../r/return.md)."

### Calculation of Abnormal Return

The calculation of abnormal [return](../r/return.md) can be depicted through the following formula:

\[ AR = R_i - E(R_i) \]

Where:
- \( AR \) stands for abnormal [return](../r/return.md).
- \( R_i \) is the actual [return](../r/return.md) of the [security](../s/security.md).
- \( E(R_i) \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the [security](../s/security.md).

#### Expected Return Models

Several models exist to estimate the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) (\( E(R_i) \)):

1. **[Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM):**
   The CAPM is a popular model that relates the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of a [security](../s/security.md) to its [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), as measured by [beta](../b/beta.md) (\( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \)):

   \[ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (R_m - R_f) \]

   Where:
   - \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.
   - \( \beta_i \) is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the [security](../s/security.md).
   - \( R_m \) is the expected [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md).

2. **Fama-French Three [Factor](../f/factor.md) Model:**
   This model expands on CAPM by including two additional factors beyond [market risk](../m/market_risk.md): size and [value](../v/value.md):

   \[ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (R_m - R_f) + s_i (SMB) + h_i (HML) \]

   Where:
   - \( SMB \) stands for the size [premium](../p/premium.md) (small minus big).
   - \( HML \) stands for the [value premium](../v/value_premium.md) (high minus low).

3. **[Arbitrage Pricing Theory](../a/arbitrage_pricing_theory.md) (APT):**
   APT is a [multi-factor model](../m/multi-factor_model.md) that considers various macroeconomic factors:

   \[ E(R_i) = R_f + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \beta_{ij} F_j \]

   Where:
   - \( \beta_{ij} \) measures the sensitivity of the [security](../s/security.md) to [factor](../f/factor.md) \( j \).
   - \( F_j \) represents the [risk premium](../r/risk_premium.md) for [factor](../f/factor.md) \( j \).

### Significance in Finance

Abnormal returns are significant for a variety of reasons:

1. **Event Studies:**
   Abnormal returns are widely used in event studies to measure the impact of corporate events like mergers, [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md), or regulatory changes on stock prices.

2. **Performance Evaluation:**
   Investors and portfolio managers use abnormal returns to assess the performance of an investment or portfolio. Superior skill or strategy should [yield](../y/yield.md) consistent positive abnormal returns.

3. **[Market Efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md):**
   The concept of abnormal returns is central to [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) theories. In efficient markets, abnormal returns should be rare and statistically insignificant over the [long run](../l/long_run.md).

### Practical Applications

#### Quantitative Hedge Funds

[Quantitative hedge funds](../q/quantitative_hedge_funds.md) often [leverage](../l/leverage.md) sophisticated algorithms and statistical models to identify and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on abnormal returns. These funds rely on a [range](../r/range.md) of data sources and techniques such as [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), to find inefficiencies in the [market](../m/market.md).

For example, **Two Sigma** [two sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) is a known quantitative [fund](../f/fund.md) that employs vast amounts of data and [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) to detect abnormal returns and exploit these opportunities through [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).

#### Performance Analysis by Financial Analysts

Financial analysts and portfolio managers make use of abnormal [return](../r/return.md) metrics to determine the efficacy of their investment strategies. An analyst may compare the actual returns of a portfolio to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) to calculate the abnormal [return](../r/return.md) and subsequently refine strategies based on the insights gained.

### Risk and Return Adjustments

To accurately capture abnormal returns, it is crucial to consider [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) measures such as the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) or [Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md). These measures help in contextualizing abnormal returns by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the [risk](../r/risk.md) undertaken to achieve those returns.

1. **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md):**
   The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) indicates the [average return](../a/average_return.md) earned beyond the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate per unit of [volatility](../v/volatility.md):

   \[ [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p} \]

   Where:
   - \( R_p \) is the portfolio [return](../r/return.md).
   - \( \sigma_p \) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the portfolio returns.

2. **[Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md):**
   [Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md) measures the abnormal [return](../r/return.md) generated by a portfolio above the theoretical [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) based on CAPM:

   \[ \[alpha](../a/alpha.md) = R_p - [R_f + \beta_p (R_m - R_f)] \]

   Where:
   - \( \[alpha](../a/alpha.md) \) is [Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md).
   - \( \beta_p \) is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the portfolio.

### Limitations and Challenges

While the concept of abnormal [return](../r/return.md) is enormously useful, several limitations and challenges exist:

1. **Model Accuracy:**
   The accuracy of [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) models like CAPM or APT is critical. Misestimating the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) can lead to incorrect assessments of abnormal returns.

2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Changes:**
   [Financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) are dynamic, and factors influencing expected returns can change, making static models less reliable over time.

3. **[Noise](../n/noise.md) and Data Quality:**
   The presence of [noise in financial data](../n/noise_in_financial_data.md) and inaccurate input can distort the calculation of abnormal returns, leading to misleading conclusions.

4. **Short-term Focus:**
   Overemphasis on short-term abnormal returns can deter investors from maintaining a long-term investment perspective, often leading to suboptimal investment decisions.

### Conclusion

Abnormal [return](../r/return.md) remains an essential concept in [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), providing a critical measure of performance beyond [market](../m/market.md) expectations. It serves as a diagnostic tool for event studies, performance evaluations, and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) analyses. Despite its limitations, it continues to be an invaluable metric for investors seeking to measure and optimize their investment strategies. Whether through sophisticated [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) or [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted performance evaluations, detecting and understanding abnormal returns is a perpetual endeavor for financial analysts and investors alike.
