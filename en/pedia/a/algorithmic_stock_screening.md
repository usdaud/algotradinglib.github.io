# Algorithmic Stock Screening

Algorithmic stock screening is a critical application of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) that leverages technology and computational power to filter through extensive stock data. The goal is to identify [stocks](../s/stock.md) that meet certain predefined criteria, making it easier for traders and investors to focus on potential opportunities without manually analyzing each stock.

## Introduction to Stock Screening

Stock screening is a process where investors use a set of criteria to find [stocks](../s/stock.md) that meet specific financial, technical, or fundamental parameters. Traditionally, this could involve manual analysis, but with the advent of computing power and sophisticated algorithms, this has become more efficient and effective.

## Components of Algorithmic Stock Screening

### 1. **Data Collection**

**Data** is the foundation of any successful stock screening algorithm. The data sources can be diverse, including:

- **[Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md)**: [Income](../i/income.md) statements, balance sheets, and [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) statements.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Data**: Real-time and historic quotes, trading volumes, and price changes.
- **Qualitative Data**: News articles, [social media sentiment](../s/social_media_sentiment.md), and analyst reports.

### 2. **Preprocessing**

**Preprocessing** involves cleaning and organizing the raw data into a more usable format. This can include:

- **[Data Cleaning](../d/data_cleaning.md)**: Removing discrepancies, filling missing values, and correcting errors.
- Filtering out irrelevant information.
- Normalizing data to ensure uniformity in formats.

### 3. **Feature Selection and Extraction**

**Feature selection** and **extraction** involve identifying and creating relevant metrics and attributes from the data that [will](../w/will.md) be used for screening. Examples include:

- **Fundamental Indicators**: P/E ratio, EPS, ROE, etc.
- **[Technical Indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md)**: Moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.
- **Custom Indicators**: Combination or transformation of existing indicators.

### 4. **Building the Screening Algorithm**

**Building the algorithm** is perhaps the most crucial part of the process. This step involves:

- **Defining Criteria**: Establishing what financial, technical, or other criteria a stock must meet. These criteria can be user-defined or based on established models.
- **[Algorithm Design](../a/algorithm_design.md)**: Creating the logic that [will](../w/will.md) apply the criteria to the stock data to filter out relevant [stocks](../s/stock.md). This can be based on simple logic rules or more complex [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models.

### 5. **Backtesting**

**[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)** is the process of testing the algorithm on historical data to evaluate its performance. This is an essential step to understand the potential effectiveness of the screening algorithm.

- **Procedure**: Running the algorithm on past data and checking how well the selected [stocks](../s/stock.md) would have performed.
- **Metrics**: Analyzing various [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) such as accuracy, precision, recall, and [return](../r/return.md) on investment (ROI).

### 6. **Optimization and Fine-Tuning**

**[Optimization](../o/optimization.md)** involves tweaking the algorithm to improve its performance. This can include:

- **Parameter Tuning**: Modifying thresholds and conditions in the criteria.
- **Algorithm Improvement**: Incorporating feedback from [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) to make the algorithm smarter.
- **Validation**: Ensuring the algorithm performs well on out-of-sample data sets.

## Types of Screening Algorithms

### **Rule-Based Screening**

**Rule-based screening** algorithms apply a predefined set of rules to filter [stocks](../s/stock.md). These rules are based on investment strategies like [value](../v/value.md), growth, or [momentum investing](../m/momentum_investing.md).

- **Example**: A rule-based algorithm might filter [stocks](../s/stock.md) with a P/E ratio below a certain threshold and an EPS growth rate above a specific percentage.

### **Machine Learning-Based Screening**

**[Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md)-based screening** algorithms use advanced statistical models to identify patterns and make predictions about [stocks](../s/stock.md).

- **Example**: Using a random forest classifier to predict stock price movements based on various input features like [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) and financial metrics.

### **Hybrid Approaches**

Some screening algorithms combine **rule-based** and **[machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md)** techniques to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the benefits of both approaches.

- **Example**: A hybrid algorithm might first use rule-based screening to narrow down the universe of [stocks](../s/stock.md) and then apply a [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) model to rank the best [options](../o/options.md).
