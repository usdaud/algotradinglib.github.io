# Altcoin

The term "Altcoin" is short for "alternative coin" and is used to describe all cryptocurrencies other than [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md). When [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) was launched in 2009, it became the first decentralized cryptocurrency. As [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)'s popularity soared, various developers created alternative cryptocurrencies. These alternative cryptocurrencies are collectively referred to as altcoins, indicating their nature as alternatives to the original [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md).

## Origins and Evolution of Altcoins

### Early Beginnings

After the advent of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), it became clear that the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology had much more potential than just facilitating digital payments. Developers started to explore other applications for this technology, leading to the creation of the first altcoins. Essentially, [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) laid the foundational blueprint, and altcoins emerged to extend or modify that blueprint.

The first altcoin created was Namecoin, developed in April 2011. Namecoin was designed to provide more decentralization, [security](../s/security.md), and censorship resistance in the internet's naming and identity [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). Thus, Namecoin attempted to replace the traditional DNS.

### The Rise in Popularity

[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), launched in 2015, dramatically changed the altcoin landscape. [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) allowed developers to run decentralized applications (DApps) and [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) on its platform. The [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) included an integrated programming language that facilitated the creation of these [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), essentially software codes that automatically execute based on predetermined conditions. The introduction of [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) marked a significant shift in the perception and [utility](../u/utility.md) of altcoins, making them instrumental in broader [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) applications beyond just payments.

## Categories of Altcoins

Altcoins can be categorized into several broad groups based on their functionalities and goals:

### 1. **Mining-Based Coins**
[Mining](../m/mining.md)-based coins are cryptocurrencies that are obtained through the [mining](../m/mining.md) process, which entails solving complex cryptographic problems to validate transactions on the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). Examples include Litecoin, Monero, and [ZCash](../z/zcash.md).

### 2. **Stablecoins**
Stablecoins aim to provide price stability by [pegging](../p/pegging.md) their [value](../v/value.md) to a reserve [asset](../a/asset.md) such as fiat [currency](../c/currency.md), commodities, or other cryptocurrencies. Popular examples include Tether (USDT), DAI, and TrueUSD.

### 3. **Security Tokens**
[Security](../s/security.md) tokens represent ownership in an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), often a company’s [shares](../s/shares.md) or [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). These tokens are subject to federal securities regulations, differentiating them from other cryptocurrencies. Examples include Polymath and [tZero](../t/tzero.md).

### 4. **Utility Tokens**
[Utility](../u/utility.md) tokens [offer](../o/offer.md) users access to a product or service within a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) ecosystem. These tokens are not designed as investments but serve as functional digital assets in specific applications. Examples include Basic Attention Token (BAT) used in the Brave browser ecosystem and Chainlink (LINK) used for connecting [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) with real-world data.

### 5. **Forks**
Forks occur when a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) diverges into two potential paths forward. Forks are of two types: hard forks, which result in a new cryptocurrency, and soft forks, which are updates to the original [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). Examples include [Bitcoin Cash](../b/bitcoin_cash.md) (hard fork of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic (hard fork of [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md)).

## Technological Differences from Bitcoin

### Consensus Mechanisms

While [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) utilizes a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, altcoins have experimented with a variety of alternative mechanisms aimed at improving [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), speed, and [scalability](../s/scalability.md):

#### Proof of Stake (PoS)
Popularized by coins like [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) 2.0 and Cardano, PoS requires validators to [hold](../h/hold.md) and lock a certain amount of [currency](../c/currency.md) as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to validate transactions, as opposed to solving complex cryptographic puzzles.

#### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
In DPoS, such as in [EOS](../e/eos.md) and TRON, token holders vote for delegates who then validate transactions and secure the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). This aims to enhance [scalability](../s/scalability.md) and performance.

#### Proof of Authority (PoA)
Utilized by some private, permissioned blockchains, PoA relies on a few trusted nodes for [transaction](../t/transaction.md) validation. This method offers higher [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) but compromises on decentralization.

### Features and Functionalities

#### Smart Contracts
[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) introduced the concept of [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), which are now a mainstay in the altcoin world. By enabling programmable, automated transactions, [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) [open](../o/open.md) up myriad possibilities ranging from financial services to [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management.

#### Privacy
Privacy-focused altcoins like Monero and [ZCash](../z/zcash.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure [transaction](../t/transaction.md) anonymity, addressing concerns around [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)’s pseudonymity.

#### Interoperability
Some altcoins strive to facilitate interoperability between different [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) networks. For instance, Polkadot and Cosmos aim to allow data and tokens to move seamlessly across varying blockchains.

## Impact on the Financial World

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
DeFi refers to financial services that use [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology to [offer](../o/offer.md) decentralized alternatives to traditional [finance](../f/finance.md). Most DeFi projects are built on [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), utilizing its smart contract capabilities. Examples include lending platforms like Aave, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, and synthetic [asset](../a/asset.md) generators like Synthetix.

### Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)
Between 2017 and 2018, ICOs became a popular way for startups to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing new altcoins. Although ICOs provided an innovative funding route, they also led to numerous scams and regulatory scrutiny, causing them to fall out of favor.

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
NFTs represent ownership of unique digital assets and have gained widespread attention for their application in digital art, gaming, and collectibles. [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), with its [robust](../r/robust.md) smart contract functionality, has become the predominant platform for NFTs, although other blockchains like [Binance](../b/binance.md) Smart Chain and Flow are also entering the space.

## Legal and Regulatory Challenges

Altcoins face a labyrinth of legal and regulatory challenges. Governments worldwide grapple with how to categorize altcoins: as securities, commodities, or entirely new types of assets. The U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC), for example, has taken a cautious approach, often treating ICOs as securities offerings. Regulation remains a double-edged sword; while it can stifle innovation, it also lends credibility and protection to genuine projects.

## Major Players and Platforms

### Ethereum
[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) has become the leading platform for [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) and DApps. Its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md). The [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) platform has paved the way for the burgeoning DeFi and NFT sectors. More about [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) can be found at the Ethereum Foundation.

### Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
The [Binance](../b/binance.md) Smart Chain was developed by the [Binance](../b/binance.md) [exchange](../e/exchange.md) to [offer](../o/offer.md) a high-performance [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) that supports [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) and DApps. BNB, its native token, is widely used for [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) and staking.
