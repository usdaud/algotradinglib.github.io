# Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate [marketing](../m/marketing.md) is a performance-based [marketing strategy](../m/marketing_strategy.md) where businesses reward affiliates (partners) for driving traffic, sales, or other desired actions to the company's website through the affiliate's own [marketing](../m/marketing.md) efforts. This strategy creates a symbiotic relationship where both the [business](../b/business.md) and the affiliate benefit from successful conversions.

## Key Players in Affiliate Marketing

### The Merchant (Advertiser)

The merchant, also known as the advertiser or retailer, is the company that wants to sell its products or services. They use affiliate [marketing](../m/marketing.md) to expand their reach and sales by leveraging the efforts of a network of affiliates. Examples of merchants include large e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) websites, software companies, and service providers.

Affiliates, also called publishers, are individuals or companies that promote the merchant's products or services through various [marketing](../m/marketing.md) channels, such as websites, blogs, [social media](../s/social_media.md), and email [marketing](../m/marketing.md). Affiliates can [range](../r/range.md) from bloggers and influencers to large media websites.

### The Consumer

The consumer is the end user who interacts with the affiliate's [marketing](../m/marketing.md) content and completes the desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a service. The consumer may or may not be aware that they are part of an affiliate [marketing](../m/marketing.md) scheme.

3. **Promotion**: Affiliates create and distribute content to promote the merchantâ€™s products or services through their chosen channels.
4. **Tracking and Conversion**: When a consumer clicks an affiliate link and completes a purchase or another action, the affiliate network or merchant tracks the conversion.
