# Arbitrage Strategies in Different Markets

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is the simultaneous purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from a difference in the price across different markets or forms. It exploits short-term discrepancies in the prices of identical or similar financial instruments on different markets or in different forms. These strategies are fundamental in making markets more efficient as they help in achieving price [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) by balancing discrepancies through immediate trading actions. 

## Types of Arbitrage

### 1. **Pure Arbitrage**

Pure [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), often referred to as classical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), involves buying and selling the same [asset](../a/asset.md) simultaneously in different markets to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price discrepancies. The key here is that the price difference represents a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md).

**Example:**
If a stock is trading at $100 on the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) and at $101 on the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LSE), a [trader](../t/trader.md) could buy the stock on NYSE and simultaneously sell it on LSE, capturing a [profit](../p/profit.md) of $1 per share minus [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

### 2. **Risk Arbitrage**

[Risk](../r/risk.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), also known as [merger](../m/merger.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), occurs when an [investor](../i/investor.md) attempts to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [merger](../m/merger.md) or [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) announcements. Investors typically buy the stock of the company being acquired and short sell the stock of the acquiring company, banking on the spread between the [offer](../o/offer.md) price and the current trading price narrowing as the deal closes.

**Example:**
Company A announces plans to acquire Company B for $50 per share, but Company B’s [shares](../s/shares.md) are currently trading at $45. An [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md) might buy [shares](../s/shares.md) of Company B at $45 and [profit](../p/profit.md) if the deal goes through and [shares](../s/shares.md) eventually [trade](../t/trade.md) up to the [offer](../o/offer.md) price of $50.

### 3. **Convertible Arbitrage**

Convertible [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking a long position in a company’s convertible securities, like bonds or preferred [shares](../s/shares.md), and a short position in the company’s [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). The expectation is that the convertible [security](../s/security.md) and the short stock position [will](../w/will.md) [offset](../o/offset.md) one another, allowing small, consistent profits regardless of the [market](../m/market.md) direction.

**Example:**
An [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) and shorts the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock. If the stock price drops, the [short sale](../s/short_sale.md) profits [offset](../o/offset.md) the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s decreased [value](../v/value.md), and if the stock price rises, the convertible feature allows for profitable conversion.

### 4. **Fixed-Income Arbitrage**

Fixed-[income](../i/income.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies involve the simultaneous purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of different bonds to exploit price differences. This can include trading between bonds of different maturities, ratings, or from different issuers.

**Example:**
A [trader](../t/trader.md) notices that 10-year [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bonds are [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) relative to 5-year [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bonds. They might buy the 10-year bonds and short the 5-year bonds, profiting as the spread between them adjusts.

### 5. **Statistical Arbitrage**

Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves using complex [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) to identify temporary price discrepancies among a set or 'basket' of securities. Traders use algorithms to predict price movements based on historical relationships, and profits are made on the convergence of the securities' prices.

**Example:**
A statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) model might identify that stock A and stock B typically have a price [correlation](../c/correlation.md). If this [correlation](../c/correlation.md) temporarily diverges, the [trader](../t/trader.md) may short the over-performing stock and go long the under-performing stock to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the reversion to the mean.

### 6. **Triangular Arbitrage**

Triangular [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) typically occurs in the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md), involving three currencies. Traders exploit discrepancies between three related [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs, converting one [currency](../c/currency.md) to another, then to a third, and back to the first, ideally ending up with a [profit](../p/profit.md) after the round-trip conversion.

**Example:**
If USD/EUR, EUR/GBP, and GBP/USD quotes presented an inconsistency, a [trader](../t/trader.md) could [exchange](../e/exchange.md) USD for EUR, then EUR for GBP, and finally GBP back to USD, ultimately ending with more USD than initially held due to the exploited rate differences.

### 7. **Cross-Border Arbitrage**

Cross-border [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies involve taking advantage of the price differences of securities that [trade](../t/trade.md) on [multiple](../m/multiple.md) international exchanges. The [trader](../t/trader.md) buys the [asset](../a/asset.md) in the [market](../m/market.md) where it is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) and sells it in the [market](../m/market.md) where it is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md).

**Example:**
A stock traded on both the Tokyo and New York exchanges might be priced differently due to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies, or other factors. An [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md) might buy the stock in Tokyo where it is cheaper and sell it in New York where it is more expensive.

## Arbitrage in Different Markets

### **Equity Markets**

[Equity](../e/equity.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves exploiting price discrepancies of [stocks](../s/stock.md) on different exchanges or [derivative](../d/derivative.md) markets. This can include [index](../i/index_instrument.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), and sector-based strategies.

**Example:**
[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) takes advantage of discrepancies between [index futures](../i/index_futures.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md). If the future is overpriced relative to the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) [value](../v/value.md), arbitragers may sell the future and buy the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) and vice versa.

### **Commodity Markets**

[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) deals with price differences in commodities across different markets or forms. Traders make profits from misalignments in the prices of related [commodity](../c/commodity.md) contracts or between spot markets and [futures](../f/futures.md).

**Example:**
A [trader](../t/trader.md) might notice that gold is priced differently in the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) compared to the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md). By buying gold in the cheaper [market](../m/market.md) and simultaneously selling it in the higher-priced [market](../m/market.md), they can lock in a [profit](../p/profit.md).

### **Foreign Exchange Markets**

In forex markets, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) trading involves exploiting minor price discrepancies among different [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs or among [currency](../c/currency.md) exchanges. 

**Example:**
[Currency](../c/currency.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) could include taking advantage of different [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates offered by banks or forex brokers for the same [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs. Using triangular [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), traders can [profit](../p/profit.md) from minute differences in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates.

### **Credit Markets**

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) in [credit](../c/credit.md) markets involves exploiting pricing inefficiencies between different [credit](../c/credit.md) instruments or between [credit](../c/credit.md) instruments and their [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

**Example:**
In the case of [bond](../b/bond.md) and [credit](../c/credit.md) [default](../d/default.md) [swap](../s/swap.md) (CDS) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), the [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md) takes opposite positions in the [bond](../b/bond.md) and its corresponding CDS to lock in the price discrepancy and [profit](../p/profit.md) from the difference in [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) pricing.

### **Cryptocurrency Markets**

The relatively new and less efficient cryptocurrency markets [offer](../o/offer.md) unique [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities due to significant price differences across various exchanges.

**Example:**
A [bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md) might notice price differences for [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) on [Binance](../b/binance.md) and [Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md). By buying [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) at a lower price on one [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and selling it at a higher price on the other, they can capture a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md) after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for trading fees.

### **Derivative Markets**

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities in the [derivative](../d/derivative.md) markets involve exploiting price differences between [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and their [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. These could exist in [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), or other [derivative](../d/derivative.md) products.

**Example:**
[Options](../o/options.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), like the "conversion" or "[reversal](../r/reversal.md)" strategy, involves a combination of buying and selling the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock and various [options](../o/options.md) to lock in a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md) when the pricing between the stock and [options](../o/options.md) is misaligned.
