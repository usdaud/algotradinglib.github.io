# Advanced Technical Analysis

[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) is a method used to evaluate and predict the future price movements of financial instruments, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), currencies, or commodities, by analyzing past [market](../m/market.md) data, primarily price and [volume](../v/volume.md) data. Advanced [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) goes a step further, employing more complex indicators, patterns, and techniques to [gain](../g/gain.md) deeper insights and enhance [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). This comprehensive guide [will](../w/will.md) delve into the various aspects, tools, and methodologies involved in advanced [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md).

### 1. Depth of Market (DOM)

Depth of [Market](../m/market.md), often referred to as the [order book](../o/order_book.md), is a tool that shows the [volume](../v/volume.md) of buy and sell orders for a particular [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) at various price levels. This allows traders to gauge the [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics, providing insights into potential price movements. Traders can identify significant [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, assess [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and detect possible manipulation.

### 2. Volume Analysis

[Volume analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md) involves interpreting trading volumes to assess the strength or weakness of a price movement. Higher trading volumes often indicate stronger price trends, while lower volumes may signal a lack of conviction. Key [volume](../v/volume.md)-based indicators include:

- **On-Balance [Volume](../v/volume.md) (OBV)**: OBV measures cumulative buying and selling pressure by adding the [volume](../v/volume.md) on up days and subtracting it on down days.
- **[Volume](../v/volume.md)-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price (VWAP)**: VWAP is the average price a [security](../s/security.md) has traded at throughout the day, [weighted](../w/weighted.md) by [volume](../v/volume.md).

### 3. Chart Patterns

[Advanced chart patterns](../a/advanced_chart_patterns.md) are formations that emerge in price charts, which can indicate potential future price movements based on historical trends. Some of the most important [advanced chart patterns](../a/advanced_chart_patterns.md) include:

- **Head and Shoulders**: This [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern indicates a change from bullish to bearish [trend](../t/trend.md) or vice versa. It consists of three peaks: a higher peak between two lower peaks, resembling a head and shoulders.
- **[Double Top](../d/double_top.md) and [Double Bottom](../d/double_bottom.md)**: These are classic [reversal patterns](../r/reversal_patterns.md). A [double top](../d/double_top.md) signals a bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md) after reaching a resistance level twice, while a [double bottom](../d/double_bottom.md) indicates a bullish [reversal](../r/reversal.md) after hitting a support level twice.
- **Triangles (Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical)**: These [continuation patterns](../c/continuation_patterns.md) indicate periods of [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) before a continuation of the prevailing [trend](../t/trend.md).

### 4. Advanced Candlesticks

[Candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md) are essential tools in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). Advanced [candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md) provide deeper insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and potential reversals. Some key patterns include:

- **Engulfing Pattern**: A [bullish engulfing pattern](../b/bullish_engulfing_pattern.md) takes place when a small bearish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) is followed by a larger bullish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) that completely engulfs it. A [bearish engulfing pattern](../b/bearish_engulfing_pattern.md) occurs when a small bullish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) is followed by a larger bearish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md).
- **[Doji](../d/doji.md)**: A [doji](../d/doji.md) candle forms when the [open](../o/open.md) and close prices are virtually the same, signifying indecision or a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) in the [market](../m/market.md).
- **Hammer and Hanging Man**: A hammer indicates a potential bullish [reversal](../r/reversal.md) after a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), characterized by a small body and a long lower shadow. The hanging man signals a potential bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md) after an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), with similar characteristics to the hammer.

### 5. Technical Indicators

[Technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) are mathematical calculations based on price, [volume](../v/volume.md), or [open interest](../o/open_interest.md) data. Advanced [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) help traders to make more informed decisions. Some popular advanced indicators include:

- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI)**: RSI measures the speed and change of price movements, ranging from 0 to 100. A [value](../v/value.md) above 70 typically indicates [overbought](../o/overbought.md) conditions, while a [value](../v/value.md) below 30 suggests [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.
- **Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD)**: MACD is a [trend](../t/trend.md)-following [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that shows the relationship between two moving averages. The MACD line is the difference between a 26-period and 12-period EMA, and the signal line is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line.
- **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) consist of a middle band (a simple moving average) and an upper and lower band (standard deviations from the middle band). They provide a visual representation of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential price breakouts.

### 6. Fibonacci Analysis

Fibonacci analysis involves using mathematical ratios derived from the Fibonacci sequence to identify potential [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels. Key Fibonacci levels include 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%, which often coincide with significant price [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points. Traders use [Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) and extension tools to project potential price targets and entry/exit points.

### 7. Elliott Wave Theory

[Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md), developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott, is a form of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) that identifies recurring [wave patterns](../w/wave_patterns_in_trading.md) to predict [market](../m/market.md) trends. The theory consists of two types of waves: impulse waves (in the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md)) and corrective waves (against the [trend](../t/trend.md)). [Elliott Wave patterns](../e/elliott_wave_patterns.md) help traders understand the cyclical nature of markets and anticipate future price movements.

### 8. Ichimoku Cloud

The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, or [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md), is a comprehensive technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that provides information on support/resistance levels, [trend](../t/trend.md) direction, and [momentum](../m/momentum.md). It consists of five main components:

- **Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line)**: The average of the highest high and lowest low over the previous 9 periods.
- **Kijun-sen (Base Line)**: The average of the highest high and lowest low over the previous 26 periods.
- **Senkou Span A (Leading Span A)**: The average of the Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen, plotted 26 periods ahead.
- **Senkou Span B (Leading Span B)**: The average of the highest high and lowest low over the previous 52 periods, plotted 26 periods ahead.
- **Chikou Span (Lagging Span)**: The closing price plotted 26 periods behind.

### 9. Market Profile

[Market](../m/market.md) profile is a charting technique that displays the [volume](../v/volume.md) traded at various price levels over a specified time period. It provides a graphical representation of where the most trading activity occurs, indicating significant [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels.

### 10. Sentiment Analysis

[Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) involves gauging the overall mood of [market](../m/market.md) participants to predict potential price movements. Advanced sentiment tools include:

- **Commitment of Traders (COT) Report**: Published by the [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC), the COT Report provides insights into the positions of different [market](../m/market.md) participants, such as commercial traders, non-commercial traders, and small traders.
- **[Social Media](../s/social_media.md) Analysis**: Analyzing [social media sentiment](../s/social_media_sentiment.md), such as tweets, forum posts, and news articles, can provide real-time insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and potential price moves.

### 11. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

[Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and AI are increasingly being integrated into advanced [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to improve the accuracy and efficacy of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Techniques such as [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md), [support vector machines](../s/support_vector_machines_in_trading.md), and [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) enable traders to analyze vast amounts of data, uncover hidden patterns, and make more informed decisions.

### 12. Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo-trading, involves using computer algorithms to execute trades based on predefined criteria. Advanced [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tools and indicators are often integrated into these algorithms to enhance their precision and profitability.
