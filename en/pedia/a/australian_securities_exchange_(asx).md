# Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)

The Australian Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ASX) is Australia's primary securities [exchange](../e/exchange.md), located in Sydney, New South Wales. ASX operates markets for a diverse [range](../r/range.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes including equities, [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), commodities, and more. It acts as a comprehensive platform that serves various stakeholders in the financial [industry](../i/industry.md), such as companies looking to raise [capital](../c/capital.md), investors seeking to buy and sell securities, and various firms engaging in investment and financial services. Algortrading is one such domain deeply interlinked with the functioning of ASX.

## Historical Background

The history of ASX dates back to the 19th century with the establishment of Australia's first stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in Melbourne in 1861. Over the years, six state-based stock exchanges operated independently. The [amalgamation](../a/amalgamation.md) of these exchanges in the late 20th century led to the formation of a unified [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

The Australian Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Limited (ASX) was established in 1987 under the Australian Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Act. In 2006, the ASX merged with the Sydney [Futures](../f/futures.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), further extending its [market](../m/market.md) capabilities. This [merger](../m/merger.md) resulted in the present-day Australian Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md).

## Market Structure

ASX operates under a highly structured environment taking into account various factors that support an efficient and transparent [market](../m/market.md) system. This includes:

### Equity Market

The [equity market](../e/equity_market.md) is one of ASX's most prominent trading platforms, where [shares](../s/shares.md) of publicly-[listed](../l/listed.md) companies are bought and sold. Companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on ASX [range](../r/range.md) from small- and mid-sized enterprises to large multinational corporations. The [market](../m/market.md) provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), enabling investors to [trade](../t/trade.md) securities and companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md).

### Fixed Income

ASX also operates markets for various fixed-[income](../i/income.md) products including government bonds, corporate bonds, and other [debt](../d/debt.md) securities. These markets provide mechanisms for governments and corporations to [issue](../i/issue.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) and for investors to diversify their portfolios.

### Derivatives Market

The [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md) on ASX allows participants to [trade](../t/trade.md) [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), and other complex financial products. These instruments are valuable for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), hedging, and speculative purposes.

### ETFs and Managed Funds

ASX offers a [range](../r/range.md) of [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs) and managed funds, giving investors new avenues for investment. These instruments can be traded similarly to [stocks](../s/stock.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) exposure to a broad array of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

## Algortrading and Electronic Market Operations

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algortrading) has seen significant adoption within ASX. [Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) involves using [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) and pre-defined rules to execute trades. The increased speed, accuracy, and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) provided by algortrading have revolutionized trading on ASX.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency trading is a subset of algortrading that involves making numerous trades in fractions of a second. HFT uses algorithms to recognize [market](../m/market.md) signals and execute trades at extremely high speeds, often capitalizing on small price discrepancies.

### Market Access and Trading Technology

ASX has invested heavily in advanced trading technology to support algortrading. The ASX [Trade](../t/trade.md) platform is built to [handle](../h/handle.md) high-speed and high-frequency trading operations, ensuring low latency and high [throughput](../t/throughput.md). Moreover, ASX has integrated FIX (Financial Information [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)) protocol for streamlined electronic trading.

## Regulatory Environment

ASX operates within a stringent regulatory framework overseen by the Australian Securities and Investments [Commission](../c/commission.md) (ASIC) and the Reserve [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Australia (RBA). These bodies ensure that trading on ASX remains fair, transparent, and orderly.

### ASX Listing Rules

The ASX Listing Rules are comprehensive guidelines that companies must adhere to for listing and ongoing compliance. These rules encompass aspects like financial reporting, [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements to protect investors and maintain [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

### Surveillance and Monitoring

ASX employs sophisticated surveillance systems to monitor trading activities and detect any form of [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) or abuse. Their [Market](../m/market.md) Insights unit analyzes trading patterns and can alert authorities about suspicious activities.
