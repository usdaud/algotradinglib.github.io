# Active Trading

Active trading is a style of trading that involves frequent buying and selling of financial instruments in order to profit from short-term price movements. The holding period can range from seconds to days, and the approach emphasizes execution speed, risk control, and consistent opportunity selection.

## Key Characteristics
- High trade frequency and short holding periods.
- Reliance on technical analysis, order flow, or short-term catalysts.
- Active position management with predefined exits and risk limits.

## Typical Instruments
Active traders often focus on liquid markets with tight spreads, such as major equities, index futures, liquid options, and major FX pairs. High liquidity reduces slippage and makes risk management more predictable.

## Infrastructure Requirements
Because active trading depends on speed and precision, it benefits from reliable market data, low latency execution, and robust trading platforms. Order routing quality and real-time risk controls are often more important than complex models.

## Risk and Discipline
Frequent trading increases exposure to transaction costs, execution risk, and psychological fatigue. A clear plan for position sizing, stop placement, and daily risk limits is essential to avoid overtrading.

## Performance Measurement
Key metrics include win rate, average win versus average loss, profit factor, and maximum drawdown. Consistency and risk-adjusted returns are more important than occasional large wins.

## Advantages and Challenges
Active trading can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and exploit short-term inefficiencies. However, it requires strong discipline, a repeatable edge, and a realistic understanding of costs and slippage.

## Edge Sources

Strategies seek an edge from structural effects, behavioral biases, risk premia, or informational advantages. A clear statement of the edge helps determine where and when the strategy should work.

The edge should be tested across multiple market regimes to avoid overreliance on a narrow historical period.

## Process and Workflow

A disciplined workflow typically includes signal generation, risk checks, execution planning, and post trade review. Each step should be standardized to reduce discretionary errors.

Automation can improve consistency, but manual oversight is still important when market conditions change.

## Risk Controls

Key controls include position sizing, stop placement, and exposure limits by asset or factor. Risk should be expressed in both price and dollar terms to avoid surprises.

Scenario analysis is useful for understanding the impact of gaps, volatility spikes, and liquidity shocks.

## Costs and Capacity

Transaction costs, slippage, and financing can erode expected returns. The strategy should be tested with realistic cost assumptions and with an estimate of capacity.

A strategy that works at small size may fail at scale if liquidity is limited.

## Evaluation

Evaluate performance using risk adjusted metrics such as Sharpe, drawdown, and hit rate. Stability of returns and adherence to the strategy rules are as important as headline profit.

## Example Scenario

Consider a liquid instrument with stable spreads and average volatility. A rule based implementation can be tested on a multi year sample and then on an out of sample period. The goal is to verify that the behavior of Active Trading is consistent across regimes and that the edge does not depend on a narrow set of conditions.

## Implementation Checklist

- Confirm data quality and consistent timestamps
- Define entry and exit rules in plain language
- Validate position sizing and risk limits
- Track execution costs and slippage
- Review performance by regime and by instrument
