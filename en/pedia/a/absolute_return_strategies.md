# Absolute Return Strategies

[Absolute return](../a/absolute_return.md) strategies aim to generate positive returns regardless of [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Unlike traditional strategies that [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) performance against a [market index](../m/market_index.md), [absolute return](../a/absolute_return.md) strategies focus on achieving consistent positive returns in both rising and falling markets. These strategies are often associated with [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and other managed investment products. Below, we delve into the different methodologies, instruments, and characteristics of [absolute return](../a/absolute_return.md) strategies.

## Types of Absolute Return Strategies

### 1. Market Neutral Strategies
[Market neutral strategies](../m/market_neutral_strategies.md) aim to minimize [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) by taking long and short positions in various [stocks](../s/stock.md) or securities. These positions are structured to [offset](../o/offset.md) each other, helping to provide a [return](../r/return.md) that is largely independent of the overall [market](../m/market.md) movements.

**Example:**
A [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) might take a long position in [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) while simultaneously taking short positions in [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). The goal is to achieve a "[neutral](../n/neutral.md)" exposure to [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), while profiting from the relative performance of the selected [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### 2. Arbitrage Strategies
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies exploit price discrepancies between related securities. By simultaneously buying and selling similar or related instruments, traders can lock in [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits.

#### Subtypes:
- **Convertible [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Involves buying convertible securities (such as bonds) and shorting the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) common [stocks](../s/stock.md).
- **[Merger](../m/merger.md) [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Capitalizes on price differences between the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of a target company's stock and the [offer](../o/offer.md) price in a proposed [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

**Example:**
If Company A announces the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of Company B at a share price higher than Company B's current trading price, an [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md) might buy [shares](../s/shares.md) of Company B and short [shares](../s/shares.md) of Company A, expecting to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the eventual price convergence.

### 3. Statistical Arbitrage
Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves using [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) to identify and exploit pricing inefficiencies. Techniques often include [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies and [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), where traders simultaneously buy and sell correlated assets to achieve [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) exposure.

**Example:**
A [trader](../t/trader.md) might use historical price data and sophisticated algorithms to find pairs of [stocks](../s/stock.md) (e.g., two technology companies) that typically move together. When the prices diverge beyond a certain threshold, the [trader](../t/trader.md) could buy the underperforming stock and short the outperforming stock, expecting the prices to converge.

### 4. Event-Driven Strategies
Event-driven strategies seek to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on price movements stemming from specific events such as mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, or [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md). 

**Example:**
- **[Merger](../m/merger.md) [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** As discussed, involves taking positions based on announced mergers.
- **[Distressed Securities](../d/distressed_securities.md):** Focuses on companies in [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md), betting that the securities might recover in [value](../v/value.md).

### 5. Global Macro
[Global macro strategies](../g/global_macro_strategies.md) involve taking long and short positions in various [equity](../e/equity.md), [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), [currency](../c/currency.md), and commodities marketsâ€”and are driven by broad economic and political views.

**Example:**
A [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) might take a long position in Japanese yen while shorting the [euro](../e/euro.md), based on economic forecasts and geopolitical [risk](../r/risk.md) assessments.

### 6. Multi-Strategy
Multi-strategy funds diversify across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [absolute return](../a/absolute_return.md) methodologies to reduce [risk](../r/risk.md) and enhance returns. This involves simultaneously employing different strategies like [market neutral](../m/market_neutral.md), [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), and event-driven within a single [fund](../f/fund.md).

**Example:**
A multi-strategy [fund](../f/fund.md) might allocate a portion of its [capital](../c/capital.md) to statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), another portion to event-driven strategies, and yet another to [global macro](../g/global_macro.md) plays.

## Key Characteristics of Absolute Return Strategies
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Strategies often feature advanced [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques, including [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), hedging, and [diversification](../d/diversification.md).
- **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md):** Some [absolute return](../a/absolute_return.md) strategies, especially those employed by [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, may use [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to amplify returns.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):** Strategies may focus on highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) securities to ensure quick entry and exit from trades, although some might take positions in less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) markets.
- **Sophistication:** These strategies typically require advanced understanding of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md), and [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) analysis.
- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** Lower [transparency](../t/transparency.md) compared to traditional mutual funds, often due to the proprietary nature of the strategies used.
