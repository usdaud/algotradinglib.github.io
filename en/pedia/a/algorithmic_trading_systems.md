# Algorithmic Trading Systems

Algorithmic trading systems are end-to-end setups that include data, models, execution, risk, and operations. Unlike a framework, a system encompasses the full production environment and the processes used to run it.

## System Architecture
A complete system includes market data feeds, storage, strategy engines, order management, risk controls, and monitoring. It also requires scheduling, configuration management, and incident response procedures. Each layer must be reliable because failures can propagate quickly.

## Development Lifecycle
The lifecycle typically moves from research to backtesting, then to paper trading, and finally to live deployment. Each stage adds realism and operational checks. Change control is critical, especially when multiple strategies share infrastructure.

## Operations and Reliability
Live systems need high availability, redundant connections, and automated failover. Logging and metrics allow teams to detect problems quickly. Clear runbooks help respond to unusual market conditions or system failures.

## Governance and Compliance
Trading systems must follow internal policies and external regulations. Audit trails, access controls, and approval workflows protect against unauthorized changes. Regular reviews ensure that strategies remain within risk limits.

## Conclusion
Reliable algorithmic trading systems balance performance with operational stability. The goal is to produce consistent results while limiting the impact of unexpected events.
