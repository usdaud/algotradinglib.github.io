# Automated Trading

Automated trading is the use of software to execute trades with minimal human intervention. It ranges from simple rule based systems to complex models that adapt to market conditions.

## How It Works
The system ingests market data, generates signals, and submits orders through a broker or exchange. Risk checks validate each order and monitor overall exposure. Monitoring and logging provide oversight and auditability.

## Benefits
Automation enables consistent execution and faster reaction to market changes. It can scale across many instruments and time zones without fatigue. It also reduces emotional bias in decision making.

## Challenges
Automation does not remove risk. Software bugs, data errors, and infrastructure outages can cause rapid losses. Strategy performance can degrade as market regimes change or as competitors adopt similar approaches.

## Governance
Strong governance includes change control, testing, and documented procedures. Operators need clear tools for monitoring and for shutting down systems when conditions become unsafe.

## Conclusion
Automated trading delivers speed and consistency but requires disciplined engineering and risk management to remain safe in live markets.
