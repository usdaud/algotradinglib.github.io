# Always Be Closing (ABC)

"Always Be Closing" (ABC) is a strategy used commonly in sales and [business](../b/business.md) development that emphasizes the need for salespeople to focus continually on closing deals. In the world of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (often abbreviated as algo-trading), this philosophy translates into a relentless pursuit of optimizing [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) for [profit](../p/profit.md) maximization. 

## The Origin of ABC

The term "Always Be Closing" was popularized by David Mamet's 1992 film "Glengarry Glen Ross," which depicts the aggressive culture of a [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) sales office. In one famous scene, Alec Baldwin's character delivers a monologue that underscores the key tenet of sales: always be on the lookout for the next opportunity to close a deal. This approach insists that every action taken by the salesperson should be driving towards the end goal: closing a [sale](../s/sale.md).

## ABC in the Context of Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) employs powerful algorithms and financial models to make trading decisions at speeds and volumes unparalleled by human traders. ABC, when adapted to algo-trading, reflects a methodology where the primary focus is on constant [optimization](../o/optimization.md) and [execution](../e/execution.md) of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that lead to profitable transactions.

### Key Aspects of ABC in Algorithmic Trading

1. **Strategy Development**: Just as salespeople are always looking for techniques to close a deal, algo-traders must continually develop and refine algorithms that can identify [market](../m/market.md) opportunities and execute trades optimally.

2. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and [Optimization](../o/optimization.md)**: [Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) algorithms on historical data helps ensure that they perform as expected. This continuous refinement process is akin to honing a sales pitch to perfect the art of closing.

3. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: The speed of [execution](../e/execution.md) in algo-trading is critical, much like the timing of a sales pitch. An algo-[trader](../t/trader.md) achieves "closing" by executing trades at the perfect moment to maximize profitability.

4. **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Post-[execution](../e/execution.md), algorithms require constant monitoring to adapt to [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This mirrors the need to follow up on deals in sales, ensuring that any emerging issues are swiftly addressed.

5. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Effective algo-[trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) incorporate [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices. Just as sales professionals manage objections and rejections, algo-traders must mitigate risks to maintain steady profitability.

## Examples of ABC in Algo-Trading Companies

### 1. QuantConnect

[QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com) is a platform that provides tools for [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), enabling traders to backtest and execute strategies across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. [QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) places an emphasis on continuous improvement and [optimization](../o/optimization.md), embodying the ABC philosophy in the development and deployment of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

### 2. Two Sigma

[Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com) employs a scientific approach to [investment management](../i/investment_management.md). The [firm](../f/firm.md) uses [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), distributed computing, and vast sets of data to optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) continually, focusing on "closing" profitable transactions in the competitive landscape of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### 3. Renaissance Technologies

[Renaissance Technologies](https://www.rentec.com) is one of the world's most successful [quantitative hedge funds](../q/quantitative_hedge_funds.md). They are known for their relentless focus on leveraging [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) to close trades profitably, consistently refining their strategies to maintain an edge over the [market](../m/market.md).

## Tools and Technologies Supporting ABC in Algo-Trading

### 1. Machine Learning

[Machine learning algorithms](../m/machine_learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) enable the development of adaptive models that can learn from data and improve over time. By identifying patterns and trends, these models help in "closing" more profitable trades.

### 2. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Systems

HFT systems execute hundreds or thousands of trades per second. The speed at which these systems operate ensures that opportunities are capitalized upon immediately, embodying the "Always Be Closing" mantra in a literal sense.

### 3. Data Analytics and Big Data

Large datasets provide the raw material for analysis and strategy development. Advanced analytics techniques allow traders to extract actionable insights from [big data](../b/big_data_in_trading.md), optimizing their algorithms for better performance.

## Ethical and Practical Considerations

### Market Impact

While ABC can drive significant profits, it also raises ethical considerations. High-frequency trading, for example, can contribute to [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and impact [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Traders must balance their pursuit of profits with the broader implications for [market](../m/market.md) health and fairness.

### Transparency and Regulation

Regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing algorithmic and high-frequency trading. [Transparency](../t/transparency.md) in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) practices ensures a fairer marketplace and builds [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence. Algo-traders must comply with regulations while maintaining their focus on closing trades profitably.

## Conclusion

The "Always Be Closing" philosophy in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) underscores the importance of continuous development, [optimization](../o/optimization.md), and [execution](../e/execution.md) of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). By leveraging advanced technologies and [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md), algo-traders strive to "close" as many profitable trades as possible, embodying the relentless pursuit of success that the ABC mantra encapsulates. The examples of companies like [QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md), Two Sigma, and Renaissance Technologies illustrate how this philosophy is applied in the real world, driving innovation and profitability in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
