AAX, short for Atom [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), was a cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) platform that offered various financial services including spot trading, [futures](../f/futures.md) trading, savings products, and more. The platform was known for its [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), [security](../s/security.md), and adoption of high-frequency trading technologies.

## Overview

AAX was established in 2018 and had its headquarters in Hong Kong. The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) is built by a team of financial professionals and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) experts who aim to [offer](../o/offer.md) a seamless trading experience for both retail and institutional traders. AAX is distinguished by being the first cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) to be powered by the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Group's (LSEG) technology, which significantly enhances its trading engine's speed and reliability.

## Key Features

For more advanced traders, AAX provides [futures](../f/futures.md) trading [options](../o/options.md).
