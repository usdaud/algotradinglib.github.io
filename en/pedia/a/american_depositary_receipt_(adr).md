# American Depositary Receipt (ADR)

An American [Depositary Receipt](../d/depositary_receipt.md) (ADR) is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that allows U.S. investors to purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) in foreign companies without the complexities of dealing with a foreign stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). ADRs are certificates issued by U.S. banks, representing one or more [shares](../s/shares.md) of a foreign company, and are traded on U.S. exchanges like the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md). This creates a more accessible and convenient means for U.S. investors to diversify their portfolio internationally within a familiar marketplace.

## History and Development of ADRs

The concept of ADRs was introduced in 1927 by J.P. Morgan, when the [bank](../b/bank.md) helped British retailer Selfridges [float](../f/float.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) in the United States. The primary motivation behind ADRs was to enable American investors to own [shares](../s/shares.md) in foreign companies and earn dividends in U.S. dollars. By addressing issues related to cross-border [taxation](../t/taxation.md), [currency](../c/currency.md) conversion, and other complexities, ADRs facilitated a smoother [transaction](../t/transaction.md) process.

## Structure and Function of ADRs

ADRs are created when a U.S. [bank](../b/bank.md) purchases a bulk number of [shares](../s/shares.md) from a foreign [firm](../f/firm.md) and deposits them with a foreign branch or [custodian](../c/custodian.md). The [bank](../b/bank.md) then issues a proportional number of ADRs that represent these [shares](../s/shares.md) and can be traded on U.S. exchanges. ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars, and any dividends distributed by the foreign company are converted to U.S. dollars for the ADR holders.

ADRs can be classified into three levels based on the degree of compliance with U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) regulations and the extent to which they are traded:

### Level I ADRs

These are the simplest form and least regulated by the SEC. Companies issuing Level I ADRs do not need to meet full SEC reporting requirements and typically [trade](../t/trade.md) over-the-counter (OTC), providing limited [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [visibility](../v/visibility.md). They are often used by companies wishing to establish a U.S. [market](../m/market.md) presence without undergoing the rigorous compliance needed for full [exchange](../e/exchange.md) listing.

### Level II ADRs

Level II ADRs require more stringent SEC compliance, including the submission of Form 20-F, which aligns with the reporting standards similar to those followed by U.S. companies. These ADRs can list on major exchanges like NYSE or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md), resulting in greater [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and improved [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for the foreign [issuer](../i/issuer.md). They [offer](../o/offer.md) a significant advantage in terms of enhancing the company’s [market](../m/market.md) reach and [investor](../i/investor.md) base in the U.S.

### Level III ADRs

Level III ADRs [offer](../o/offer.md) the highest level of compliance with SEC regulations and are associated with initial public offerings (IPOs) on U.S. exchanges. Companies issuing Level III ADRs must adhere to full SEC [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements, including adhering to Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These ADRs provide the greatest benefits in terms of [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and credibility, facilitating substantial [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising opportunities directly from U.S. investors.

## Benefits of ADRs

### For Investors

1. **Simplified Investment in Foreign Securities**: ADRs enable U.S. investors to easily diversify their portfolios by directly [investing](../i/investing.md) in foreign companies without dealing with the complexities of foreign exchanges.

2. **[Currency](../c/currency.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md) Reduction**: ADRs eliminate the need for investors to manage [currency](../c/currency.md) conversions, as dividends are paid in U.S. dollars, mitigating the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) fluctuations.

3. **Regulatory Safeguards**: ADRs traded on major exchanges are subject to SEC regulations, which provide a level of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) protection comparable to that afforded to U.S. securities.

4. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Convenience**: Dividends are distributed in U.S. dollars, making it convenient for investors to manage their [income](../i/income.md) streams without dealing with foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) exchanges.

### For Foreign Companies

1. **Access to U.S. [Capital Markets](../c/capital_markets.md)**: ADRs [offer](../o/offer.md) foreign companies exposure to a vast pool of U.S. investors and [capital](../c/capital.md), potentially lowering their [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) due to the [market](../m/market.md)'s [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and depth.

2. **Increased [Visibility](../v/visibility.md) and [Investor](../i/investor.md) Base**: Listing ADRs on U.S. exchanges grants foreign companies greater [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and access to a broader [investor](../i/investor.md) base, enhancing their global profile and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) diversity.

3. **Regulatory Credibility**: Compliance with SEC regulations can enhance the credibility and perceived stability of foreign companies, instilling greater confidence among investors.

## Risks and Considerations

### Exchange Rate Risk

While ADRs mitigate specific [currency](../c/currency.md) risks by denominating dividends in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) between the U.S. dollar and the foreign company's operational [currency](../c/currency.md) can still impact the overall investment returns.

### Political and Economic Risks

Foreign companies are subject to political and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) in their [home](../h/home.md) countries, which can affect their operational performance and, subsequently, the [value](../v/value.md) of their ADRs. These factors include regulatory changes, economic instability, and geopolitical events.

### Differences in Accounting Standards

Foreign companies might adhere to different [accounting principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) compared to U.S. GAAP, leading to discrepancies in financial reporting. Investors need to consider these differences when evaluating the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and performance of ADR-issuing companies.

## Examples and Key Players

### Alibaba Group

Alibaba Group, the Chinese multinational [conglomerate](../c/conglomerate.md) specializing in e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md), technology, and retail, is a prominent example of a company with Level III ADRs [listed](../l/listed.md) on the NYSE. This listing has significantly increased Alibaba’s [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) base in the U.S., facilitating [capital](../c/capital.md) raising and global [expansion](../e/expansion.md) efforts.

## ADR Issuance Process

The issuance process for ADRs involves several steps:

1. **Selection of a Depositary [Bank](../b/bank.md)**: The foreign company selects a U.S.-based depositary [bank](../b/bank.md) to manage the ADR process. This [bank](../b/bank.md) [will](../w/will.md) act as the intermediary between the foreign company and U.S. investors.

2. **[Deposit](../d/deposit.md) of [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: The foreign company deposits its [shares](../s/shares.md) with the chosen depositary [bank](../b/bank.md) or its [custodian](../c/custodian.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) located in the company's [home](../h/home.md) country.

3. **Issuance of ADRs**: The depositary [bank](../b/bank.md) issues ADRs representing these [shares](../s/shares.md). Each ADR can represent one or more [shares](../s/shares.md) of the foreign company, based on the predetermined ratio.

4. **SEC Registration**: Depending on the ADR level, the foreign company may need to register the ADRs with the SEC and comply with relevant reporting and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements.

5. **Listing and Trading**: Once registered, ADRs can be [listed](../l/listed.md) and traded on U.S. exchanges or OTC markets, making them accessible to U.S. investors.

## Conclusion

American Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) (ADRs) are a pivotal mechanism that bridges the gap between U.S. investors and foreign companies, [offering](../o/offering.md) a simplified and regulated pathway to international investment. By providing an accessible and familiar means to diversify portfolios and raise [capital](../c/capital.md), ADRs have become an integral part of the global financial landscape, benefiting both investors and issuing companies alike.
