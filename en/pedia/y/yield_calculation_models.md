# Yield Calculation Models

[Yield](../y/yield.md) calculation models represent the set of mathematical and statistical techniques employed to determine the profitability of financial instruments, particularly bonds, but also other investment products. [Yield](../y/yield.md) serves as a critical measure reflecting the returns generated by an investment, which is pivotal for assessing and comparing the relative attractiveness of different investment opportunities. In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (algo-trading), these models play a crucial role as they help in the decision-making process by providing quantitative insights into expected returns, [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment, and optimal [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md). This detailed exploration covers various widely adopted [yield](../y/yield.md) calculation models, their methodologies, applications, and pertinence to algo-trading.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## 1. Current Yield

**[Current Yield](../c/current_yield.md)** is a straightforward [yield](../y/yield.md) calculation model predominantly used for bonds to assess the annual [income](../i/income.md) generated relative to its current [market price](../m/market_price.md). The formula for [current yield](../c/current_yield.md) is:
\[ \text{[Current Yield](../c/current_yield.md)} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon [Payment](../p/payment.md)}}{\text{Current [Market Price](../m/market_price.md)}} \]

### Application in Algo-Trading
In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the [current yield](../c/current_yield.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) a quick estimation of the [income](../i/income.md) [return](../r/return.md) on bonds, allowing [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) to spot [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) bonds that provide higher [income](../i/income.md) relative to their [market](../m/market.md) prices. However, [current yield](../c/current_yield.md) does not account for the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [maturity](../m/maturity.md), price changes, or [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) risks.

## 2. Yield to Maturity (YTM)

**[Yield to Maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) (YTM)** is a comprehensive [yield](../y/yield.md) metric considering the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s current [market price](../m/market_price.md), [par value](../p/par_value.md), coupon [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), and time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md). It represents the internal [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (IRR) of the [bond](../b/bond.md), as it equates the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of all future cash flows (coupon payments and [par value](../p/par_value.md)) to the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s current [market price](../m/market_price.md). The YTM is calculated using a trial and error method since the formula involves solving for the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) in the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of cash flows equation.

### Application in Algo-Trading
YTM is widely utilized in algo-trading for its holistic consideration of [bond](../b/bond.md) characteristics. [Trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) [leverage](../l/leverage.md) YTM to evaluate and compare investment bonds, making it easier to identify investments with favorable returns. Algorithms can also recalibrate portfolios dynamically based on changing YTM values.

## 3. Yield to Call (YTC)

**[Yield to Call](../y/yield_to_call.md) (YTC)** applies to callable bonds, incorporating the potential that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) might redeem the [bond](../b/bond.md) before [maturity](../m/maturity.md) at a preset call date. The YTC formula focuses on the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s coupon payments, price, call price, and the time to call.

\[ \text{YTC} = \frac{C + \frac{CP - P}{t}}{\frac{CP + P}{2}} \]

Where:
- \(C\) = coupon [payment](../p/payment.md)
- \(CP\) = call price
- \(P\) = current [market price](../m/market_price.md)
- \(t\) = years to call

### Application in Algo-Trading
YTC becomes crucial for algo-[trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) involving callable bonds as it factors in the additional dimension of call [risk](../r/risk.md). Algorithms using YTC can better assess and mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with premature [bond](../b/bond.md) [redemption](../r/redemption.md) by issuers.

## 4. Yield to Worst (YTW)

**[Yield to Worst](../y/yield_to_worst.md) (YTW)** calculates the lowest potential [yield](../y/yield.md) that can be received on a [bond](../b/bond.md) without the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) defaulting. This metric considers all possible call dates or other provisions that might affect the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [yield](../y/yield.md).

### Application in Algo-Trading
YTW is integral for [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies. By pinpointing the worst-case [yield](../y/yield.md) scenario, [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) can provide a buffer for investment portfolios, selecting bonds that maintain an acceptable [yield](../y/yield.md) threshold under adverse conditions.

## 5. Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)

**SOFR** is a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for dollar-denominated loans and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). It reflects the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by Treasury securities, and is seen as a [robust](../r/robust.md) alternative to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

### Application in Algo-Trading
In algo-trading, SOFR serves as a key [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) for pricing short-term [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) instruments, including [futures](../f/futures.md), [options](../o/options.md), and swaps. Algorithms can deploy SOFR to enhance the precision of [valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md), [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md), and to ensure resilience against [market](../m/market.md) shifts due to changes in [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates.


## 6. Zero-Coupon Yield

Zero-Coupon [Yield](../y/yield.md) derives from zero-coupon bonds, which do not make periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments but are issued at a deep [discount](../d/discount.md) to their [face value](../f/face_value.md), paying the full [face value](../f/face_value.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). The [yield](../y/yield.md) is calculated by understanding the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the face amount.

\[ \text{[Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \left(\frac{F}{P}\right)^{\frac{1}{t}} - 1 \]

Where:
- \(F\) = [face value](../f/face_value.md)
- \(P\) = [present value](../p/present_value.md) or purchase price
- \(t\) = time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md)

### Application in Algo-Trading
Zero-Coupon [Yield](../y/yield.md) is valuable for [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) construction, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and portfolio immunization in algo-trading. Algorithms assess these yields to match liabilities and optimal timing for cash flows.

## 7. Discount Yield

**[Discount Yield](../d/discount_yield.md)** is typically used for Treasury Bills and other similar instruments. It calculates the [yield](../y/yield.md) based on the difference between [nominal](../n/nominal.md) [par value](../p/par_value.md) and the purchase price, annualized based on a 360-day year.

\[ \text{[Discount Yield](../d/discount_yield.md)} = \frac{F - P}{F} \cdot \frac{360}{t} \]

### Application in Algo-Trading
In algo-trading, [discount yield](../d/discount_yield.md) aids in the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) and comparison of short-term government securities. This metric allows algorithms to rapidly assess Treasuries' returns, making for effective short-term investment and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) management strategies.

## 8. Spot Rate

**[Spot Rate](../s/spot_rate.md)** represents the [yield](../y/yield.md) on a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) maturing at a particular point in time. It typically builds the foundation of the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md).

### Application in Algo-Trading
Spot rates are crucial for constructing [yield](../y/yield.md) curves used in pricing and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) of financial instruments. Algorithms utilize spot rates for [discounting](../d/discounting.md) cash flows to [present value](../p/present_value.md) and for [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities to exploit discrepancies.

## 9. Forward Rate

**[Forward Rate](../f/forward_rate.md)** is the agreed-upon [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for future periods, inferred from the [spot rate](../s/spot_rate.md) curve. It’s critical for contracts like [Forward Rate](../f/forward_rate.md) Agreements (FRAs).

### Application in Algo-Trading
Forward rates are essential for formulating algo-[trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) around [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and future-oriented contracts. Algorithms use forward rates to price FRAs, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements, and develop [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) forecasts.

## 10. Effective Yield

**[Effective Yield](../e/effective_yield.md)** adjusts the [nominal yield](../n/nominal_yield.md) for the effects of [compounding](../c/compounding.md), providing a more accurate measure of returns.

\[ \text{[Effective Yield](../e/effective_yield.md)} = \left(1 + \frac{i}{n}\right)^n - 1 \]

Where:
- \(i\) = [nominal interest rate](../n/nominal_interest_rate.md)
- \(n\) = number of [compounding](../c/compounding.md) periods per year

### Application in Algo-Trading
[Effective yield](../e/effective_yield.md) finds considerable use in algo-trading by delivering a true depiction of [investment income](../i/investment_income.md), particularly for bonds with frequent coupon payments. Algorithms use [effective yield](../e/effective_yield.md) for ensuring investment strategies are aligned with realistic [return](../r/return.md) expectations.

## Conclusion

[Yield](../y/yield.md) calculation models are indispensable in the quantification and evaluation of [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) returns. In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), these models facilitate precise, data-driven decisions that align closely with the investment objectives and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) levels of the trading entity. The integration of various [yield](../y/yield.md) models enhances the algorithms' capability to perform thorough analyses, optimizations, and strategic executions, thereby significantly influencing [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md) and profitability.
