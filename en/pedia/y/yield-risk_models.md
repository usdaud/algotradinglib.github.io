# Yield-Risk Models

[Yield](../y/yield.md)-[Risk Models](../r/risk_models_in_trading.md) are essential tools in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) for assessing potential returns against their inherent risks. These models help traders design, evaluate, and execute [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) by quantitatively analyzing historical data and [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This document [will](../w/will.md) delve into the intricacies of [Yield](../y/yield.md)-[Risk Models](../r/risk_models_in_trading.md), discussing their fundamental principles, types, key components, and applications in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). 

## Fundamental Principles

At their core, [Yield](../y/yield.md)-[Risk Models](../r/risk_models_in_trading.md) aim to balance the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between expected returns ([yield](../y/yield.md)) and associated risks. The goal is to optimize the [benefit-cost ratio](../b/benefit-cost_ratio.md) to maximize profitability while minimizing potential losses. Two primary factors drive these models:

1. **[Yield](../y/yield.md):** The [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) from an investment, typically measured as annual percentage [yield](../y/yield.md) (APY) or [return](../r/return.md) on investment (ROI).
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md):** The susceptibility of returns to rise or fall, commonly evaluated using metrics like [volatility](../v/volatility.md), [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR), and [beta](../b/beta.md) coefficients.

## Types of Yield-Risk Models

### 1. **Mean-Variance Optimization Model**
  - Developed by [Harry Markowitz](../h/harry_markowitz.md), this model is part of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).
  - **Formula:**
    \[
    \text{[Expected Return](../e/expected_return.md)} = \sum_{i} w_i \times r_i
    \]
    \[
    \text{[Portfolio Variance](../p/portfolio_variance.md)} = \sum_{i} \sum_{j} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}
    \]
  - **Applications:**
    - [Portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md).
    - Adjusting the weights of assets to maximize [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md).

### 2. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**
  - Developed by William Sharpe, CAPM determines the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) based on its [beta](../b/beta.md) and expected [market](../m/market.md) returns.
  - **Formula:**
    \[
    E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)
    \]
  - **Applications:**
    - Evaluating the required [return](../r/return.md) to justify the [risk](../r/risk.md).
    - Benchmarking [asset](../a/asset.md) performance against [market](../m/market.md) trends.

### 3. **Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)**
  - Introduced by Stephen Ross, APT is a multifactor model to estimate [asset](../a/asset.md) returns.
  - **Formula:**
    \[
    E(R_i) = \alpha_i + \beta_{i1} F_1 + \beta_{i2} F_2 + \ldots + \beta_{in} F_n
    \]
  - **Applications:**
    - Identifying and leveraging [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities.
    - Diversifying through [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md).

### 4. **Black-Scholes Model**
  - A model for pricing [European options](../e/european_options.md) and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton.
  - **Formula:**
    \[
    C = S_0 N(d1) - X e^{-rt} N(d2)
    \]
    
    where,
    \[
    d1 = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{S_0}{X}\right) + \left(r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)t}{\sigma \sqrt{t}}
    \]
    
    \[
    d2 = d1 - \sigma \sqrt{t}
    \]
  - **Applications:**
    - Calculating fair prices of [options](../o/options.md).
    - Assessing [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies.

### 5. **Factor Models**
  - Include Fama-French three-[factor](../f/factor.md) model, Carhart four-[factor](../f/factor.md) model, and others.
  - **Formula (Fama-French):**
    \[
    R_i - R_f = \alpha_i + \[beta](../b/beta.md) (R_m - R_f) + s SMB + h HML + e_i
    \]
  - **Applications:**
    - Enhancing CAPM by including size [risk](../r/risk.md) and [value](../v/value.md) [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md).
    - Evaluating performance through [multiple](../m/multiple.md) dimensions of [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Key Components of Yield-Risk Models

### Historical Data Analysis
  - [Yield](../y/yield.md)-[Risk Models](../r/risk_models_in_trading.md) rely heavily on historical data to project future performance.
  - Factors analyzed include past returns, [asset](../a/asset.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and historical price trends.

### Risk Metrics
  - **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** A measure of price fluctuations.
  - **[Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR):** The potential loss in [value](../v/value.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) over a defined period for a given [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md).
  - **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md):** Measures [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md). 
  - **[Beta Coefficient](../b/beta_coefficient.md):** Evaluates an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s sensitivity to [market](../m/market.md) movements.
  
### Optimization Algorithms
  - Algorithms play a crucial role in refining model parameters.
  - Techniques include [genetic algorithms](../g/genetic_algorithms_in_trading.md), [simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md), and gradient descent.
