# Yoyo Market

A yoyo market is a market condition characterized by frequent reversals and choppy price action. Prices swing up and down without sustained direction, making trend trading difficult.

## Characteristics
- Short lived moves that reverse quickly.
- Many false breakouts and breakdowns.
- Higher noise relative to signal.

## Example
An index rallies for two days, then sells off for two days, repeating without breaking the broader range. Traders describe this as a yoyo market.

## Trading implications
In a yoyo market, mean reversion strategies may work better than trend following. Tight risk control and selective entries are important.

## Practical notes
Traders may reduce size or stay on the sidelines during yoyo conditions to avoid overtrading.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Yoyo Market and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Yoyo Market as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Yoyo Market, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Yoyo Market. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Yoyo Market alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
