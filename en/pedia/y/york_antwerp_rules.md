# York Antwerp Rules

The York Antwerp Rules are a set of principles that define the application and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of General Average in maritime transport. General Average is a legal principle under [maritime law](../m/maritime_law.md) wherein all stakeholders in a sea voyage proportionally share any losses resulting from voluntary sacrifices of part of the ship or cargo to save the whole in an emergency. The York Antwerp Rules provide a standardized method for calculating and distributing these shared losses and have been widely adopted in international shipping.

## Origins and Development

The York Antwerp Rules were first established in 1890 during the International Law Association (ILA) conference in York and were later amended in Antwerp in 1924, hence the name. The purpose of these rules was to eliminate the inconsistencies and uncertainties that existed in domestic maritime laws regarding General Average. Over the years, the rules have been reviewed and updated [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times to meet the changing dynamics of global shipping. Key revisions occurred in 1950, 1974, 1994, and most recently in 2016. The 2016 version is the most current and is generally referred to in international contracts for carriage of goods by sea.

## Key Principles of the York Antwerp Rules

### Rule A: General Average Defined

This rule defines what constitutes a General Average act. It states that any extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure made intentionally and reasonably for the common safety and for the purpose of preserving from peril the property involved in a sea adventure is considered a General Average act.

### Rule B: Common Maritime Adventure

Rule B specifies the conditions under which General Average may apply, focusing on the requirement that the venture be a common maritime adventure. This means that all parties involved, including shipowners, cargo owners, and other stakeholders, have combined interests in the voyage's successful completion.

### Rule C: Exclusions

Rule C clarifies that losses or damages that are not directly associated with the act of General Average are not covered. This includes damages caused by delay and wages and maintenance of crew during the detention of the ship.

### Rule D: Fault

Rule D states that the fault or neglect of any party to the venture [will](../w/will.md) not automatically disqualify an incident from being considered as General Average. However, the idea is to base the claim on the act itself rather than on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) cause or fault.

### Rule E: Claims

Rule E outlines the procedural requirements for presenting a claim under General Average. It mandates timely notification and adequate documentation to substantiate the claim.

### Apportionment and Settlement

The York Antwerp Rules provide detailed guidelines for apportioning the loss among the different parties based on the [value](../v/value.md) of each party's [interest](../i/interest.md) in the maritime venture. The rules specify that the apportionment should be fair and equitable, reflecting the contributions of the various parties to the overall [value](../v/value.md) at [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Application in Modern Shipping

The York Antwerp Rules are integral to maritime contracts and are often cited in standard contracts of carriage such as the Hague-Visby Rules and various charter parties. Their application ensures that stakeholders have a predictable and standardized method for handling losses due to General Average, thereby reducing the potential for disputes and litigation.

### Example of Application

Suppose a ship carrying [multiple](../m/multiple.md) cargoes encounters a severe storm, leading the captain to jettison some containers overboard to stabilize the vessel. Under the York Antwerp Rules, the shipowner, along with the owners of the remaining cargo, would share the financial burden of the loss of the jettisoned containers proportionally to their interests in the voyage.

## Criticisms and Limitations

While the York Antwerp Rules provide a comprehensive framework, they are not without criticisms and limitations. One major criticism is the complexity involved in calculating and documenting claims under the rules. Additionally, some stakeholders argue that the rules are outdated and do not adequately address modern shipping practices and technologies.

## Conclusion

The York Antwerp Rules form a cornerstone of modern [maritime law](../m/maritime_law.md), providing a [robust](../r/robust.md) and standardized framework for sharing losses due to extraordinary sacrifices made for the common good during maritime adventures. While they have evolved over more than a century and continue to be widely adopted, ongoing assessments and revisions are necessary to keep the rules relevant to the changing landscape of global shipping.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for York Antwerp Rules and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.
