# Yield-Curve Trading

[Yield](../y/yield.md)-curve trading, a sophisticated strategy employed predominantly in [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) markets, involves trading based on the anticipated movements of the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md). The [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) is a graphical representation showing the relationship between the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) ([yield](../y/yield.md)) and the time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of the [debt](../d/debt.md) for a given borrower in a given [currency](../c/currency.md). Typically, this term structure illustrates yields for [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities for various maturities, ranging from short-term instruments like one-month bills to long-term securities like 30-year bonds.

## Understanding Yield Curves

### Types of Yield Curves

1. **Normal [Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md)**:
 - The most common [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) shape.
 - Long-term yields are higher than short-term yields.
 - Indicates [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) expectations and [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

2. **Inverted [Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md)**:
 - Short-term yields are higher than long-term yields.
 - Often seen as a predictor of economic [recession](../r/recession.md).

3. **Flat [Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md)**:
 - Short-term and long-term yields are approximately equal.
 - Indicates uncertain [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

4. **Humped [Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md)**:
 - Yields increase with longer maturities up to a point then decline for even longer maturities.
 - Uncommon and can indicate complex [market](../m/market.md) expectations.

## Key Concepts in Yield-Curve Trading

### Yield Spread

The difference between yields on different maturities of bonds is known as the [yield spread](../y/yield_spread.md). Traders often focus on the spread between two specific maturities, for example, the 2-year and [10-year Treasury yield](../1/10-year_treasury_yield.md) spread, to guide trading decisions.

### Duration and Convexity

- **[Duration](../d/duration.md)** measures a [bond](../b/bond.md)’s sensitivity to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes.
- **[Convexity](../c/convexity.md)** measures the curvature of the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s price-[yield](../y/yield.md) relationship.

Understanding both helps in modeling how [bond](../b/bond.md) prices [will](../w/will.md) react to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, which is critical for [yield](../y/yield.md)-curve trading.

### Strategies in Yield-Curve Trading

1. **Trading the Steepener**:
 - This strategy profits from an expectation that the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) [will](../w/will.md) steepen.
 - Involves positioning in long-dated securities over short-dated ones when expecting higher long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

2. **Trading the Flattener**:
 - This strategy profits from an expectation that the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) [will](../w/will.md) flatten.
 - Involves buying short-dated securities and short-selling long-dated securities when expecting lower long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

3. **[Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md)**:
 - A [neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategy involving three bonds: one with a short [maturity](../m/maturity.md), one with a long [maturity](../m/maturity.md), and one with an intermediate [maturity](../m/maturity.md).
 - Profits from changes in the shape of the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md).

4. **[Duration](../d/duration.md)-[Neutral](../n/neutral.md) Strategies**:
 - Positions are constructed such that the overall [portfolio duration](../p/portfolio_duration.md) is [neutral](../n/neutral.md), aiming to minimize [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) while capitalizing on [relative value](../r/relative_value.md) between different maturities.

## Tools and Techniques for Yield-Curve Trading

### Yield Curve Models

1. **Nelson-Siegel Model**:
 - Offers a flexible approach to model [yield](../y/yield.md) curves with parameters representing the level, slope, and curvature.

2. **Vasicek Model**:
 - A one-[factor](../f/factor.md) model describing the evolution of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates using a mean-reverting stochastic process.

3. **CIR Model**:
 - Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model, a one-[factor](../f/factor.md) model similar to Vasicek but with mean-reverting variance.

## Risks and Considerations

### Interest Rate Risk

- The primary [risk](../r/risk.md) in [yield](../y/yield.md)-curve trading, involving potential losses from adverse movements in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Liquidity Risk

- Particularly relevant for less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) bonds, making it challenging to enter or exit positions without impacting prices.

### Model Risk

- The potential for losses due to inaccuracies in the models used for [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) curves.

## Conclusion

[Yield](../y/yield.md)-curve trading remains a core strategy in fixed-[income](../i/income.md) markets, demanding a deep understanding of [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements, macroeconomic indicators, and sophisticated [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques. It encompasses a [range](../r/range.md) of strategies from basic trades based on [yield](../y/yield.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) to complex positions involving [duration](../d/duration.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategies and advanced [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) models.

Strategizing trades based on the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md)'s anticipated changes enables traders and financial institutions to potentially [profit](../p/profit.md) from shifts in macroeconomic conditions, making it an essential component of modern financial [market](../m/market.md) operations.
