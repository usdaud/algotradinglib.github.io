# West Texas Intermediate (WTI)

West Texas Intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas light sweet, is a grade of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) used as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) in oil pricing. This type of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) is described as light because of its relatively low density and sweet due to its low sulfur content. WTI is considered one of the highest quality crude oils because it is easily refined into gasoline and diesel fuel. Produced primarily in the United States, WTI is the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [commodity](../c/commodity.md) of the New York Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)'s (NYMEX) oil [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md).

## Characteristics of WTI

### Lightness and Sweetness

WTI is classified as "light" because its density is lower compared to other types of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md). This makes it easier and less expensive to refine. The term "sweet" indicates a lower sulfur content, typically around 0.24%. Sulfur content is a critical [factor](../f/factor.md) in [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) quality because lower sulfur amounts reduce the environmental impact of emissions when the oil is burned.

### API Gravity

API gravity is a measure of how heavy or light [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) [liquid](../l/liquid.md) is compared to water. If a [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) [liquid](../l/liquid.md)â€™s API gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water; if it is less than 10, it is heavier and sinks. WTI has an API gravity of around 39.6 degrees, making it lighter than most grades of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md).

### Usage and Production

WTI is primarily produced in [landlocked](../l/landlocked.md) areas of the United States, particularly in Texas, North Dakota, and parts of the Midwest. The oil is transported to refineries along the Gulf Coast of the United States, where it is processed into end products such as gasoline, diesel, and other petrochemicals.

## Pricing and Market Dynamics

### Futures and Spot Market

WTI is primarily traded on [futures](../f/futures.md) markets, notably the NYMEX [exchange](../e/exchange.md), part of the CME Group. [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) allow traders to buy or sell oil at a predetermined future date and price. The [spot market](../s/spot_market.md), on the other hand, involves the buying and selling of oil for immediate delivery. Since WTI is a major [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), its price heavily influences global oil markets.

### Benchmark Comparison

WTI is one of several benchmarks worldwide, with others including Brent Crude and Dubai Crude. Brent Crude is sourced from the North Sea and is considered a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for other parts of the world. Historically, WTI has often traded at a [premium](../p/premium.md) compared to Brent due to its higher quality and lower transportation costs within the United States. However, different economic and geopolitical factors can cause WTI to [trade](../t/trade.md) at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to Brent.

### Factors Influencing WTI Prices

Several factors impact the price of WTI, including:

- **[Supply](../s/supply.md) and [Demand](../d/demand.md):** Changes in global oil production and consumption.
- **Geopolitical Events:** Conflicts, sanctions, and treaties affecting oil-producing countries.
- **[Economic Indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md):** [Economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) rates, employment data, and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).
- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Speculation](../s/speculation.md):** Trading activities by investors and speculators on [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges.
- **[Inventory](../i/inventory.md) Levels:** U.S. [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
- **Technological Advancements:** Improvements in extraction and refining technologies.

## Trading WTI

### Futures Contracts

[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) for WTI are standardized agreements to buy or sell a specified quantity of oil at a predetermined price on a future date. These contracts are heavily traded on the NYMEX platform and are crucial for both physical [market](../m/market.md) participants and financial traders. A typical NYMEX WTI [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) represents 1,000 barrels of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md).

### Options

[Options](../o/options.md) on WTI [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) provide another layer of trading opportunities. These financial instruments give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell WTI [futures](../f/futures.md) at a specific price before the option expires. This allows for more sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), including hedging and speculating on price movements with limited [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

[Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds that track WTI prices [offer](../o/offer.md) another way to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) without trading [futures](../f/futures.md) directly. ETFs like the United States Oil [Fund](../f/fund.md) (USO) are designed to mirror the performance of WTI [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), allowing retail investors to partake in oil trading more easily.

### Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) has become increasingly prevalent in WTI markets. Sophisticated algorithms analyze [market](../m/market.md) data and execute trades at speeds unimaginable for human traders. These systems employ a variety of strategies, including statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), [trend following](../t/trend_following.md), and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on small price discrepancies and [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies.

## Environmental and Regulatory Factors

### U.S. Regulation

The trading of WTI in the U.S. is subject to various regulations to ensure [market](../m/market.md) integrity and protect participants. The [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC) oversees [futures](../f/futures.md) markets, while the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) regulates ETFs and other financial instruments tied to WTI. Additionally, environmental regulations impacting drilling and refining processes also influence WTI production and pricing.

### Shale Boom

The U.S. shale boom dramatically increased WTI production, turning the United States into one of the world's largest oil producers. [Hydraulic fracturing](../h/hydraulic_fracturing.md) (fracking) and horizontal drilling technologies made it economically viable to extract oil from shale formations, leading to a significant increase in [supply](../s/supply.md).

### Environmental Concerns

Though beneficial economically, the extraction and utilization of WTI have raised numerous environmental concerns. The fracking process has been criticized for groundwater contamination and increased seismic activity. Moreover, the combustion of fossil fuels contributes to air pollution and global climate change.

## Conclusion

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) remains a cornerstone of the global oil [market](../m/market.md), acting as a primary [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) pricing. Its distinct characteristics of being light and sweet make it a highly desirable grade for refining into gasoline and other end products. While its production and trading dynamics are shaped by a myriad of factors including geopolitical events, technological advancements, and [market](../m/market.md) [speculation](../s/speculation.md), WTI continues to be a central element in understanding and navigating the complex world of energy markets. The evolution of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), particularly through algorithms, reflects the ongoing advancements in financial technologies impacting WTI markets.
