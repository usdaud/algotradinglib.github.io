# Win Rate

Win rate is the percentage of trades that are profitable. It is a simple metric that summarizes how often a strategy produces positive outcomes.

## Calculation
Win rate equals the number of winning trades divided by total trades. It can be calculated across all trades or within specific categories such as long or short positions.

## Interpretation
Win rate alone does not determine profitability. A low win rate strategy can be profitable if wins are large relative to losses. A high win rate strategy can still lose money if losses are large or if costs are high.

## Limitations
Win rate ignores trade size, volatility of returns, and drawdown. It can also be misleading for small sample sizes. It should be evaluated alongside expectancy, profit factor, and risk metrics.

## Conclusion
Win rate is useful for quick diagnostics, but it should never be used in isolation when evaluating a strategy.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Win Rate and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Win Rate as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Win Rate, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Win Rate. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Win Rate alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
