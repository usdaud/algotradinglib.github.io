# Wrong Way Risk

Wrong way risk occurs when exposure to a counterparty increases at the same time that the counterparty's ability to pay decreases. It is a key concern in credit and derivatives markets.

## Example
A bank has a derivatives exposure to an energy company. If energy prices fall, the company becomes weaker and the exposure may increase because the derivatives move in the bank's favor. The bank faces higher credit risk when it is owed more.

## Why it matters
Wrong way risk can amplify losses during stress events. It is monitored in risk systems and affects collateral and capital requirements.

## Practical notes
Managing wrong way risk involves collateral rules, counterparty limits, and diversification across counterparties.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Wrong Way Risk and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Wrong Way Risk as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Wrong Way Risk, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Wrong Way Risk. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Wrong Way Risk alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
