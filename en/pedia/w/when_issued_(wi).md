# When Issued (WI)

When Issued (WI) is a term used in financial contexts to describe a situation where a [new issue](../n/new_issue.md) of securities, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds, is authorized but not yet actually issued or delivered. These securities are traded on a conditional [basis](../b/basis.md), meaning the actual [trade](../t/trade.md) [will](../w/will.md) only be completed if and when the securities are officially issued. The term is particularly common in the contexts of treasury securities, initial public offerings (IPOs), and other new issues.

## Definition and Mechanics

### Preliminary Sale

When securities are sold on a WI [basis](../b/basis.md), the transactions are contingent. This means that the buyer and seller agree to a deal, but the completion of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is dependent on the [new issue](../n/new_issue.md) being approved and actually becoming available. This mechanism allows for [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) and provides investors a chance to [trade](../t/trade.md) the [new issue](../n/new_issue.md) even before it becomes available. It is a sort of [forward contract](../f/forward_contract.md) where the actual instruments are yet to be created.

### Conditional Nature

The transactions under a WI [basis](../b/basis.md) are conditional based on certain terms and events. If the conditions are not met—for instance, if a regulatory body does not approve the issuance—the [trade](../t/trade.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be settled, and both buyers and sellers [will](../w/will.md) essentially be released from the contract. In the time leading up to the issuance, various factors can influence the price of the WI securities, including [market](../m/market.md) conditions, [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment, and announcements from the issuing entity.

### Regulation

Trading on a WI [basis](../b/basis.md) is subject to regulation to ensure fair practices. In the United States, for example, the Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) oversee WI trading to protect investors and ensure [market](../m/market.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md). Specific rules govern the [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md), trading, and settlement conditions for WI securities.

## Applications of WI Trading

### Treasury Securities

WI trading is prevalent in the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [market](../m/market.md). When the Treasury announces a [new issue](../n/new_issue.md) of bonds, notes, or bills, these instruments often begin trading on a WI [basis](../b/basis.md). This pre-issuance trading can help to gauge [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) and establish a preliminary price for the securities. As a result, by the time the securities are officially issued, there might already be an established [market price](../m/market_price.md), promoting [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

Details on [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities and WI trading specifics can be found on the U.S. Department of the Treasury's

### Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)

In the context of IPOs, WI trading allows investors to begin trading [shares](../s/shares.md) of a company before its stock officially goes public. This can be especially useful for gauging [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) and establishing an initial [market price](../m/market_price.md) for the company's [shares](../s/shares.md). IPO WI transactions are typically contingent upon the official issuance date and confirmatory actions from both the regulatory bodies and the issuing company.

### Corporate Bonds

Much like with government securities, new issues of corporate bonds may also [trade](../t/trade.md) on a WI [basis](../b/basis.md). Companies might announce a new [debt](../d/debt.md) issuance, and these bonds can [trade](../t/trade.md) conditionally before they are formally issued. This practice helps to facilitate [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) and manage investment risks associated with new [debt](../d/debt.md) offerings.

## Risk Considerations

### Execution Risk

[Execution risk](../e/execution_risk.md) is one of the primary concerns in WI trading. Given that WI transactions are conditional, there's a [risk](../r/risk.md) that the new securities might never be issued. Investors holding WI securities may face the potential of [trade](../t/trade.md) cancellations, impacting their investment strategies and possibly leading to opportunity costs.

### Market Risk

WI securities are still subject to [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), meaning that fluctuations in the broad [market](../m/market.md) or in the specific [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s perceived [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) can affect the WI [security](../s/security.md)'s price. For instance, adverse news about an issuing company or a government can lead to notable price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in WI markets.

### Settlement Risk

Settlement [risk](../r/risk.md), also known as [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md), is inherent in WI transactions as with other forms of trading. The [risk](../r/risk.md) comes into play if one party, either the buyer or the seller, fails to fulfill their [obligations](../o/obligation.md) once the [security](../s/security.md) is issued. Regulatory frameworks often stipulate measures to mitigate these risks, such as [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements.

## Benefits of WI Trading

### Price Discovery

One of the main advantages of WI trading is the [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) it facilitates. WI trading allows [market](../m/market.md) participants to gauge [demand](../d/demand.md) and establish an initial pricing [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for new securities. This can help in smoother transitions once the securities are formally issued.

### Liquidity

WI trading promotes [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by creating an active [market](../m/market.md) for securities even before they are issued. This [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) is beneficial to investors who wish to enter or exit positions rapidly, helping to stabilize [market](../m/market.md) conditions around new issues.

### Risk Management

Investors can use WI trading for hedging purposes or to manage their portfolios more effectively. By engaging in WI transactions, institutional and retail investors can manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with new issuances ahead of time, potentially hedging against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) risks or other [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations.

## Conclusion

When Issued trading is a crucial aspect of modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). It allows for conditional trading of securities that are yet to be issued, providing key benefits such as [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Despite its advantages, WI trading also carries certain risks, including [execution](../e/execution.md), [market](../m/market.md), and settlement risks. Regulatory oversight ensures fair practices and mitigates some of these inherent risks, promoting an efficient and transparent [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

For more detailed information and regulatory guidelines, potential investors and participants can refer to official resources and platforms of financial regulatory bodies like FINRA or the SEC. The continued evolution and regulation of WI trading [will](../w/will.md) likely play a significant role in the fluidity and robustness of global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
