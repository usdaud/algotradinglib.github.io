# Writing Options

Writing options means selling options contracts and collecting premium. The writer takes on the obligation to fulfill the contract if the option is exercised by the buyer.

## Types
- Writing calls: obligation to sell the underlying at the strike.
- Writing puts: obligation to buy the underlying at the strike.

## Example
A trader sells a covered call by owning the stock and writing a call option. If the stock stays below the strike, the premium is kept. If it rises above, the stock may be called away.

## Risks
- Naked call writing has unlimited risk if the stock rises sharply.
- Put writing can lead to large losses if the stock collapses.

## Practical notes
Option writers should understand assignment risk, margin requirements, and the impact of volatility on option prices.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Writing Options and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Writing Options as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Writing Options, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Writing Options. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Writing Options alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
