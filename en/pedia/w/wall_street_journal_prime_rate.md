# Wall Street Journal Prime Rate

The [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md) [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) (often referred to simply as the "[Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md)") is a significant lending [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) in the United States [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). It plays a pivotal role in determining the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on various financial products, including personal loans, mortgages, and [credit](../c/credit.md) cards. As such, it is a critical component for both borrowers and lenders.

## Definition

The [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md) [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) is the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least 70% of the 10 largest banks in the United States. This rate is compiled and published by the [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md) (WSJ) based on a survey of these banks. The [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) is considered an important [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the direction of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and the health of the broader [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Determination and Publication

The [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) is not set by any government agency or central [bank](../b/bank.md). Instead, it is determined by individual banks. However, the rate that gets widely recognized and used is the one published by the [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md). The determination process is as follows:

1. **Survey by the [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md)**: The WSJ surveys the 10 largest U.S. banks, asking each for their current base rate on corporate loans.
2. **Publication**: The [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) is then published in the [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md) only if at least 70% of these banks change their base rate. This ensures that the rate is reflective of broad trends in the banking [industry](../i/industry.md).
3. **Frequency**: While the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) can theoretically change at any time, it usually changes in sync with the Federal Reserve's policy decisions on the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md).

## Historical Context

The [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) has undergone numerous changes over the decades in response to [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and policy measures. Here's a brief historical overview:

- **Inflationary 1970s**: The [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) reached unprecedented levels, going as high as 21.5% in December 1980 due to inflationary pressures.
- **[Economic Recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) 1980s-2000s**: The rate gradually declined and stabilized as the [economy](../e/economy.md) recovered.
- **Global [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) 2008**: The [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) dropped significantly as the Federal Reserve cut [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to stimulate the [economy](../e/economy.md).
- **Post-Crisis Era**: The rate remained low for an extended period, reflecting the low-[interest](../i/interest.md)-rate environment adopted by the Federal Reserve.

## Impact on Financial Products

### Mortgages

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lenders use the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for setting [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on variable-rate [home](../h/home.md) loans. These loans typically start with an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) tied directly to the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) plus a [margin](../m/margin.md). Therefore, changes in the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) can directly impact homeowners' monthly payments.

### Personal Loans and Credit Cards

Personal [loan](../l/loan.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates often vary with the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md). Similarly, [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are commonly calculated as the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) plus a certain spread. This means that any adjustment in the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) can affect the cost of borrowing for consumers.

### Business Loans

For [business](../b/business.md) borrowers, the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) serves as a [baseline](../b/baseline.md) for determining [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on various [credit](../c/credit.md) products, including lines of [credit](../c/credit.md) and term loans. Large corporations often have the flexibility to negotiate [interest](../i/interest.md) rates that closely track the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md), while smaller businesses may face higher rates.

## Prime Rate vs. Federal Funds Rate

The [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) is closely linked to the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), which is the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight. The Federal Reserve (the Fed) controls the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) through its [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) actions. The relationship between these two rates is significant:

- **Direct Influence**: When the Fed increases or decreases the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) usually follows suit. Banks adjust their Prime Rates shortly after a change in the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) is announced.
- **Economic Signal**: Movements in the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) signal the Fed's outlook on [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), influencing banks to adjust their lending rates accordingly.

## Economic Indicators and Influences

Several [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) and factors influence changes in the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md):

- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md)**: Rising [inflation](../i/inflation.md) often leads to higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates as lenders seek to compensate for the decreased [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of [money](../m/money.md) over time.
- **Employment**: High employment levels can lead to increased borrowing and spending, prompting banks to raise the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) to manage growth.
- **[Economic Growth](../e/economic_growth.md)**: Strong [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) can lead to higher rates, whereas periods of [recession](../r/recession.md) or slow growth often see lower rates to encourage borrowing.
- **Federal Reserve Policy**: The Fed's decisions on the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), based on their dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment, are a primary driver of changes in the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md).

## Applications and Use Cases

### Risk Management

For financial institutions, the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) plays a crucial role in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). By linking their lending rates to a commonly accepted [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), banks can better manage the risks associated with [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations. This helps in stabilizing their [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md) while [offering](../o/offering.md) competitive rates to customers.

### Investment Strategies

Investors may use the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) as a [factor](../f/factor.md) in developing investment strategies. For example, rising Prime Rates can signal a tightening [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), which could negatively affect [bond](../b/bond.md) prices but potentially benefit sectors like banking and [finance](../f/finance.md) due to higher lending rates.

### Financial Planning

For consumers, understanding the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) and its movements is essential for effective [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md). Knowledge of the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) can help individuals make informed decisions about when to borrow, [refinance](../r/refinance.md), or lock in fixed rates for loans.

## Examples of Prime Rate Use

Several major financial institutions and lenders use the [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md) [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for their [loan](../l/loan.md) products. Some examples include:

- **Chase Bank**: Chase uses the WSJ [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) as a reference for setting [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on its lending products, including [credit](../c/credit.md) cards and mortgages.
- **Bank of America**: [Bank](../b/bank.md) of America adjusts its variable [loan](../l/loan.md) rates based on changes in the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md).
- **Wells Fargo**: Wells Fargo ties the rates for certain loans and lines of [credit](../c/credit.md) to the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md), reflecting changes promptly following adjustments.

These examples demonstrate the widespread adoption of the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) as a standard in the U.S. banking system.

## Criticisms and Limitations

While the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) is a widely accepted [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), it is not without its criticisms and limitations:

- **Lag in Reaction**: There can be a lag between changes in the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) and adjustments in the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md), potentially leading to discrepancies in real-time [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md) Issues**: Some critics argue that the process of determining the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) lacks [transparency](../t/transparency.md), as it relies on the internal decisions of the largest banks without a standardized public [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md).
- **Economic Disconnect**: During periods of economic [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) or crisis, the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) may not accurately reflect [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), leading to potential mismatches in borrowing costs.

## Conclusion

The [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md) [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) is a cornerstone of the U.S. [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), serving as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for a wide array of lending products. Its close relationship with the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) makes it a critical tool for both financial institutions and borrowers. Understanding the dynamics of the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md), including its determination, impact on financial products, and broader economic implications, is essential for navigating the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and making informed financial decisions.
