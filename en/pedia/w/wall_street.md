# Wall Street

Wall Street, a globally recognized name, symbolizes the heart of the American [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md) and the epicenter of global [finance](../f/finance.md). Located in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, Wall Street encompasses a small yet incredibly powerful area that houses major financial institutions, stock exchanges, and trading firms.

## Historical Significance

Wall Street's name is derived from the wooden wall Dutch colonists built in the 17th century for protection against Native Americans and British colonists. Over time, as the American [economy](../e/economy.md) grew, Wall Street became synonymous with [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and the American [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). It transformed from a simple street to the hub of economic activities and investments.
