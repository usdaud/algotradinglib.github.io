# Wedge

In [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), a wedge is a [market](../m/market.md) pattern that develops when trading instrument prices are consolidating in an upward or downward direction. Traders often see wedges as potential signs of a [breakout](../b/breakout.md), either bullish or bearish. The wedge pattern forms when the trading [range](../r/range.md) of a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) becomes narrower over time, typically characterized by convergence of [trend](../t/trend.md) lines drawn above and below the price series.

## Types of Wedges

There are two main types of wedges:

1. **Rising Wedge:**
 - A rising wedge occurs when both the [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) lines slope upwards, but the support line is steeper than the resistance line.
 - Usually seen as a bearish continuation or [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern.
 - It indicates that the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price is likely to fall once it breaks out of the pattern.

2. **Falling Wedge:**
 - A falling wedge happens when both the [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) lines are sloping downwards, but the resistance line is steeper than the support line.
 - Generally seen as a bullish continuation or [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern.
 - It suggests that the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price is expected to rise once it breaks out of this pattern.

## Formation of Wedge Patterns

[Wedge patterns](../w/wedge_patterns.md) form through a series of higher lows and higher highs in a rising wedge, or lower highs and lower lows in a falling wedge. These patterns typically emerge over a period ranging from a few weeks to several months. The formation is complete when the price breaks through one of the [trend](../t/trend.md) lines with significant [volume](../v/volume.md).

### Rising Wedge Formation
1. Prices make higher highs and higher lows.
2. The price [range](../r/range.md) starts to narrow as the [trend](../t/trend.md) lines converge.
3. [Volume](../v/volume.md) tends to decrease as the pattern develops.
4. [Breakout](../b/breakout.md), usually on increased [volume](../v/volume.md), occurs downward, indicating a potential sell signal.

### Falling Wedge Formation
1. Prices make lower highs and lower lows.
2. The price [range](../r/range.md) narrows over time as the [trend](../t/trend.md) lines converge.
3. Decreasing [volume](../v/volume.md) is often observed as the pattern progresses.
4. The [breakout](../b/breakout.md) typically occurs upward, accompanied by higher [volume](../v/volume.md), which signals a buy opportunity.

## Interpreting Wedge Patterns

Wedges can be tricky to interpret because they appear as both continuation and [reversal patterns](../r/reversal_patterns.md). Therefore, additional [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) often help confirm the signal given by a wedge.

### Confirmation Indicators
- **[Volume](../v/volume.md):** An increase in [volume](../v/volume.md) at the point of [breakout](../b/breakout.md) helps confirm the authenticity of the move.
- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI):** RSI [divergence](../d/divergence.md) can indicate the strength or weakness behind the move.
- **Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD):** The alignment of moving averages can provide further insights into the direction of the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).

## Real-world Examples and Applications

### Equities
In the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), wedges often appear in individual stock charts and broader indices. For example, a rising wedge in an [equity](../e/equity.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) like the S&P 500 might signal an impending [market](../m/market.md) [correction](../c/correction.md).

### Forex
[Currency](../c/currency.md) pairs also exhibit [wedge patterns](../w/wedge_patterns.md). For instance, a falling wedge in EUR/USD might signal an upcoming bullish [trend](../t/trend.md), indicating a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) from a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

### Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies, known for their [volatility](../v/volatility.md), frequently show wedge formations. Observing these patterns in [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) or [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) could be crucial for timely trading decisions.

## Trading Strategies

### Entry and Exit Points
- **For Rising Wedge:**
 - **Entry:** When the price breaks below the lower support [trend](../t/trend.md) line.
 - **Exit:** A predetermined target level or based on [trailing stop](../t/trailing_stop.md) loss methods.

- **For Falling Wedge:**
 - **Entry:** When the price breaks above the upper resistance [trend](../t/trend.md) line.
 - **Exit:** Based on resistance levels or [trailing stop](../t/trailing_stop.md) loss.

### Risk Management
- **Stop-Loss:** Placing [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) just outside the pattern's boundary can minimize potential losses.
- **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md):** Adjusting the trading position size depending on the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) profile.

## Advanced Considerations

### Fibonacci Retracement
Combining [Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels with [wedge patterns](../w/wedge_patterns.md) can enhance the prediction of [breakout](../b/breakout.md) levels. For example, in a falling wedge, the [retracement](../r/retracement.md) levels might align with the potential [breakout](../b/breakout.md) points, providing a clearer target for traders.

### Algorithmic Trading
Algorithmic traders can program [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) to identify [wedge patterns](../w/wedge_patterns.md) automatically. By using tools like [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md), and traditional [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md), these systems can efficiently spot and [trade](../t/trade.md) [wedge patterns](../w/wedge_patterns.md) across various markets.

### Software
Several trading platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) tools and indicators to identify [wedge patterns](../w/wedge_patterns.md).
- **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md):** Offers customizable charts and alerts to identify [wedge patterns](../w/wedge_patterns.md).
- **MetaTrader 4 & 5:** Provides automated tools to integrate wedge [pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) into [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

For further information, [portfolio management](../p/par.md) insights, and advanced [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), organizations like QuantConnect provide platforms for developing [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md) involving various technical patterns, including wedges.

Understanding the comprehensive nature of [wedge patterns](../w/wedge_patterns.md) and their implications across different [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) allows traders and investors to make informed, strategic decisions, enhancing their [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md) and [portfolio management](../p/par.md).
