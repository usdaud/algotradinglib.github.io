# WM/Reuters Benchmark Rates

WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) (WMR) [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Rates, also broadly recognized as the WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) FX Benchmarks, represent some of the most critical [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) data utilized within the financial [industry](../i/industry.md). They provide a reliable, transparent, and independent reference to global [currency](../c/currency.md) [market](../m/market.md) rates. This [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) is essential for various transactions including portfolio [valuation](../v/valuation.md), performance evaluation, and trading in [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) markets.

## Overview

### What are WM/Reuters Benchmark Rates?

The WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Rates are [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) and [currency](../c/currency.md) benchmarks calculated by WM Company and distributed by Thomson [Reuters](../r/reuters.md). They serve as a standardized reference point for [market](../m/market.md) participants who require accurate, reliable, and transparent forex rates for various financial applications. The benchmarks are typically released at specific times throughout the day, capturing the [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) at those points.

### Historical Background

The benchmarks were established in 1994 to provide a transparent and fair indication of [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates. Over the years, they have evolved continuously to better reflect the actual trading conditions. Originally disseminated six times a day, the rates are now available hourly, catering to the needs of a global, always-on financial [market](../m/market.md).

### Importance

The WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Rates are essential for:

- Portfolio [valuation](../v/valuation.md): Ensuring that the [value](../v/value.md) of foreign securities within a portfolio is current and accurate.
- Performance measurement: Comparing the performance of investments against standardized [currency](../c/currency.md) rates.
- [Trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md): [Offering](../o/offering.md) reference points for executing [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) transactions.

## Calculation Methodology

### Data Collection

WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) collects forex rate data from a diverse [range](../r/range.md) of global [market](../m/market.md) participants, including banks and trading platforms. This data is aggregated from various [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) providers to ensure it reflects a comprehensive view of the [market](../m/market.md).

### Calculation Window

One of the unique aspects of WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Rates is the "fix" or "calculation window." This is a predefined period during which forex [market](../m/market.md) data is collected and analyzed to compute the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate. The commonly used fix window is one minute, centered around the hour, representing the most accurate [market](../m/market.md) snapshot for that particular time.

### Averaging Process

The collected [trade](../t/trade.md) data during the fix window is averaged to derive the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate. Different types of averaging methods can be applied depending on the [currency](../c/currency.md) pair and [market](../m/market.md) conditions, including:

1. **[Median](../m/median.md) Price:** The middle [value](../v/value.md) of all collected price points.
2. **[Volume](../v/volume.md)-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price (VWAP):** Averaging price points [weighted](../w/weighted.md) by trading [volume](../v/volume.md).
3. **Time-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price (TWAP):** Averaging price points over time.

### Data Integrity

Ensuring data integrity is paramount. WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) incorporates filtering mechanisms to exclude outliers or spurious data points that could distort the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate. Advanced algorithms automatically flag suspicious trades for review, ensuring the reliability of the final calculated rate.

## Key Fixing Times

### Major Fixes

- **4 PM London Time Fix:** This is the most significant fix and is widely used for portfolio valuations and trading purposes around the world. The 4 PM fix coincides with the closing of the UK [trading session](../t/trading_session.md), facilitating transition to the US [market](../m/market.md).
- **11 AM New York Time Fix:** Important for the North American markets, often used by US-based financial institutions.
- **7 PM Tokyo Time Fix:** Relevant for the Asian markets, aligns with the end of the trading day in Japan.

### Other Fixes

In addition to the major fixes, WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) provides hourly fixes around the clock to accommodate the needs of a global financial community operating across different time zones.

## Applications

### Portfolio Management

[Asset](../a/asset.md) managers and institutional investors globally use WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) Rates for daily valuations of international portfolios. Accurate forex rates are crucial to correctly assessing [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure.

### Currency Trading

Forex traders utilize these [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates as anchor points for executing trades, ensuring that transactions are aligned with standardized [market](../m/market.md) rates.

### Asset Pricing

WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) Rates are indispensable in pricing financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies. They ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and consistency in pricing [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), bonds, and other transnational assets.

### Regulatory Compliance

Financial regulations in many jurisdictions require the use of standardized benchmarks for reporting and compliance purposes. WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) Rates fulfill this need by providing an officially recognized reference.

## Challenges and Controversies

### Market Manipulation Risks

In the past, WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Rates have been at the center of controversies related to [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md). Regulators discovered instances where traders colluded to influence the fix rates for profitable gains. These scandals led to increased scrutiny and calls for reform.

### Reform Measures

To enhance the integrity of the benchmarks, several reforms have been implemented:

1. **Enhanced Oversight:** Greater regulatory oversight and independent audits to ensure compliance with [ethical standards](../e/ethical_standards_in_trading.md).
2. **Extended Calculation Windows:** Longer fix windows to dilute the impact of individual trades on the final rate.
3. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** Improved [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in data sources and calculation methodologies to rebuild [market](../m/market.md) [trust](../t/trust.md).

### Technological Challenges

Calculating accurate benchmarks requires [robust](../r/robust.md) technological [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) to [handle](../h/handle.md) enormous data volumes in real-time. WM/[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) has continuously invested in advanced technology to manage these demands efficiently.
