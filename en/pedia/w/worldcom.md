# WorldCom

WorldCom was a major American telecommunications company that became infamous for its role in one of the largest [accounting](../a/accounting.md) scandals in U.S. corporate history. The company, which was once a powerhouse in the telecommunications sector, collapsed in 2002 due to widespread financial [fraud](../f/fraud.md), leading to significant regulatory changes in how public companies report their financials.

## Background

WorldCom was incorporated in 1983 as a long-distance telephone service provider. It grew rapidly through a series of acquisitions, most notably its [merger](../m/merger.md) with MCI Communications in 1998. By the late 1990s, it was the second-largest long-distance telecommunications company in the United States, behind AT&T.

## The Rise of WorldCom

### Early Success and Expansion

Initially known as Long Distance [Discount](../d/discount.md) Services (LDDS), WorldCom was founded by Bernard Ebbers and a small group of investors. It leveraged [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md) in the telecommunications [industry](../i/industry.md) to [offer](../o/offer.md) long-distance services at competitive rates. The company went public in 1989 and began a series of aggressive acquisitions. These included:

- **Metromedia Communication Corp** in 1992 for $1.2 billion
- **Resurgens Communications Group** in 1993 for $2.5 billion
- **Advanced Telecommunications [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)** in 1994 for $2.2 billion

### Merger with MCI Communications

The [merger](../m/merger.md) with MCI Communications was a landmark event. Valued at $37 billion, it was the largest [merger](../m/merger.md) in U.S. history at the time. This move transformed WorldCom into a telecommunications giant, positioning it as a key player in the burgeoning internet and data communications [market](../m/market.md).

## The Financial Scandal

### Accounting Malpractices

Between 1999 and 2002, WorldCom committed serious [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md). The company inflated its [earnings](../e/earnings.md) by classifying its operating expenses as [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures. This helped the company overstate its net [income](../i/income.md) and its assets by billions of dollars.

#### Key Figures

- **Bernard Ebbers**: The CEO who was orchestrating these fraudulent activities. Ebbers was convicted of [fraud](../f/fraud.md), conspiracy, and false filings with the SEC.
- **Scott Sullivan**: The CFO who played a central role in the [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md). Sullivan approved many of the aggressive, false [accounting](../a/accounting.md) entries.

### The Unraveling

The scandal came to light in 2002, primarily due to internal audits and whistleblowers. Cynthia Cooper, WorldCom’s Vice President of Internal Auditing, played a crucial role in uncovering the fraudulent activities. Upon discovery, the company disclosed that it had improperly booked $3.8 billion in expenses. Subsequent investigations revealed that the total amount of inflated [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reached $11 billion.

WorldCom filed for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) on July 21, 2002. At that time, it was the largest [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in U.S. history.

## Impact and Aftermath

### Legal Repercussions

- **Bernard Ebbers**: Sentenced to 25 years in federal prison in 2005.
- **Scott Sullivan**: Sentenced to five years in prison but received a reduced sentence in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for his cooperation.

### Regulatory Changes

The scandal led to significant regulatory reforms, including the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](../s/sarbanes-oxley_(sox)_act_of_2002.md). This act introduced stringent reforms to improve financial disclosures from corporations and prevent [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md). Key features include:

- **Enhanced Financial Disclosures**: Public companies must disclose critical financial information.
- **[Internal Controls](../i/internal_controls.md)**: Corporations must establish and maintain [robust](../r/robust.md) [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md) over financial reporting.
- **Increased Penalties**: The act imposes severe penalties for fraudulent financial activities.

### Corporate Governance

The WorldCom scandal underscored the importance of ethical [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md). It served as a case study illustrating the dire consequences of neglecting fiduciary responsibilities, leading to more rigorous corporate oversight and greater accountability for executives.

## Legacy

Despite its downfall, WorldCom played a significant role in the history of telecommunications. Its ambitious mergers and acquisitions strategy laid the groundwork for modern telecom [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). The collapse emphasized the importance of ethical behavior and integrity in corporate operations.
