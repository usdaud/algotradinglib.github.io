# Weekly Return Analysis

## Introduction

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) leverages computer algorithms to create and execute [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). One key aspect of these strategies is the analysis of returns, specifically focusing on periods like days, weeks, or months. Weekly [return](../r/return.md) analysis, in particular, has garnered attention due to its ability to smooth out daily [noise](../n/noise.md) and provide insights into medium-term trends.

## Fundamentals of Weekly Return Analysis

### Definition of Weekly Return

Weekly [return](../r/return.md) is the [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) in the [value](../v/value.md) of an investment over one week. It's calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Weekly [Return](../r/return.md)} = \left( \frac{\text{Price at end of week} - \text{Price at beginning of week}}{\text{Price at beginning of week}} \right) \times 100 \]

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), weekly [return](../r/return.md) analysis helps in understanding the performance of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and the [market](../m/market.md) over a longer period than daily analysis but shorter than monthly or quarterly assessments.

### Importance in Algorithmic Trading

1. **Reducing [Noise](../n/noise.md):** Daily returns can be extremely volatile due to [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations. Weekly returns filter out some of this [noise](../n/noise.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a clearer picture.
2. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Identification:** It aids in identifying short-to-medium term trends, which can be crucial for [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) strategies.
3. **Strategy Performance Evaluation:** Weekly [return](../r/return.md) metrics provide better insights for evaluating the performance of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) over a practical time frame.
4. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Understanding weekly [return](../r/return.md) distributions assists in setting more rational stop-loss levels and [risk](../r/risk.md) parameters.

## Steps Involved in Weekly Return Analysis

### Data Collection

Accurate data collection is paramount. Sources can include historical data feeds from financial exchanges, specialized data vendors, or platforms like [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) and [Reuters](../r/reuters.md).

Companies providing comprehensive data: 
- [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com)
- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com)

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Cleaning:** Removing incorrect or missing data points.
2. **Normalization:** Adjusting stock prices for dividends and stock splits.
3. **Timestamp Alignment:** Ensuring consistency in time zones and trading hours, particularly for global portfolios.

### Return Calculation

Using adjusted closing prices, calculate the weekly returns:
- **Retrieve closing prices** for each trading day.
- **Determine the last price** of the trading week and the first price of the same week.
- **Compute the [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md)** using the formula provided above.

### Statistical Analysis

1. **[Descriptive Statistics](../d/descriptive_statistics.md):** Mean, [median](../m/median.md), [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md), [skewness](../s/skewness.md), and [kurtosis](../k/kurtosis.md) of weekly returns.
2. **[Distribution](../d/distribution.md) Fitting:** Identify whether returns follow a [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) or other heavy-tailed distributions.
3. **[Scenario Analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md):** Assess returns under different [market](../m/market.md) conditions (bullish, bearish, high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), etc.)

### Visualization

1. **[Time Series](../t/time_series.md) Plots:** Weekly returns over time.
2. **Histograms:** [Distribution](../d/distribution.md) of weekly returns.
3. **Box Plots:** Summarizing key [statistics](../s/statistics.md) of weekly returns.

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

### Strategy Development

1. **[Regression Analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md):** Model weekly returns based on predictor variables like moving averages, RSI ([Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md)), or other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md).
2. **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) Models:** Train models to predict next week's returns using past weekly returns and other features.
3. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md):** Simulate the performance of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) using historical weekly returns to validate the algorithm.

### Risk Management

1. **[Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR):** Estimate potential losses with weekly returns, aiding in setting [risk](../r/risk.md) thresholds.
