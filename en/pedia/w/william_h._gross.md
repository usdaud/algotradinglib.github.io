Born on April 13, 1944, in Middletown, Ohio, Gross is best known as the co-founder of Pacific [Investment Management](../i/investment_management.md) Company (PIMCO), one of the largest and most respected [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) firms in the world.

## Early Life and Education

William Gross attended Duke University and graduated in 1966 with a degree in psychology. He later earned an MBA from the [UCLA Anderson School of Management](../u/ucla_anderson_school_of_management.md) in 1971. His academic background in psychology has often been cited as a contributing [factor](../f/factor.md) to his deep understanding of [market](../m/market.md) behavior and [investor](../i/investor.md) psychology.

## Career Beginnings

Before founding PIMCO, Gross served in the U.S. Navy and worked as an investment analyst at Pacific Mutual Life. His early career experiences provided him with a [robust](../r/robust.md) foundation in both [leadership](../l/leadership.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md), preparing him for his future role in shaping the [bond market](../b/bond_market.md).

## Establishing PIMCO

Gross co-founded PIMCO in 1971 with Jim Muzzy and Bill Podlich. Initially, PIMCO operated as a division of Pacific Mutual [Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) Company but later became its own entity. Under Gross's [leadership](../l/leadership.md), the [firm](../f/firm.md) grew exponentially and managed assets worth over $2 trillion by the 2010s.

### Investment Philosophy

Gross's investment approach combines [quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md), macroeconomic insights, and a deep understanding of [market](../m/market.md) psychology. He has been particularly noted for his emphasis on [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [diversification](../d/diversification.md). Over the years, his strategies have offered valuable insights into how to navigate the complexities of [bond](../b/bond.md) trading and investment.

### The Total Return Fund

One of Gross's most significant contributions to PIMCO and the investment community at large is the PIMCO [Total Return](../t/total_return.md) [Fund](../f/fund.md). Launched in 1987, the [fund](../f/fund.md) became the world's largest [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md). It consistently delivered high returns through a mix of strategic [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) bets, [yield curve](../y/yard.md) positioning, and [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Inflection Point: Leaving PIMCO

In 2014, after more than four decades at PIMCO, Gross left the [firm](../f/firm.md) amid internal conflicts and declining [fund](../f/fund.md) performance. His departure was widely covered in the media and marked a significant transition both for him and PIMCO.
