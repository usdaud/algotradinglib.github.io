# Wash Trade

A wash trade is a transaction where the buyer and seller are the same party or colluding parties, creating the appearance of real trading activity without changing beneficial ownership. Wash trades are prohibited in many markets because they can mislead participants.

## Why it matters
- Artificially inflates volume.
- Distorts price discovery.
- Can be used to manipulate perceived liquidity.

## Example
A trader buys and sells the same security through related accounts to create the impression of active trading. The net position does not change, but reported volume increases.

## Regulatory context
Exchanges and regulators monitor for wash trades and can impose penalties or bans. Surveillance systems look for linked accounts and suspicious patterns.

## Practical notes
Legitimate activity such as internal transfers can be mistaken for wash trades without proper documentation.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Wash Trade and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Wash Trade as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Wash Trade, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Wash Trade. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Wash Trade alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
