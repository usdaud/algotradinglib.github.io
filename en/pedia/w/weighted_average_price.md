# Weighted Average Price

Weighted average price is the average price of trades weighted by their size. It summarizes the effective execution price across multiple fills.

## Calculation
Weighted average price equals the sum of price times quantity divided by total quantity. It provides a single number that reflects the overall execution cost for an order or series of trades.

## Use Cases
Traders use weighted average price to evaluate execution quality and to compare results against benchmarks. It is also used in reporting to summarize trade performance.

## Difference from VWAP
Weighted average price applies to a specific set of fills, often for one order. VWAP is calculated using total market volume over a period and represents a broader market benchmark. The two metrics answer different questions.

## Conclusion
Weighted average price is a simple and widely used execution metric. It should be interpreted alongside other measures such as slippage and market impact.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Weighted Average Price and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Weighted Average Price as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Weighted Average Price, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Weighted Average Price. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Weighted Average Price alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
