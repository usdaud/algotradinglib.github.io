# VantageScore

## Meaning of VantageScore

VantageScore is a [consumer credit](../c/consumer_credit.md) scoring model that was developed by the three major [credit](../c/credit.md) reporting companies—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—as an alternative to the FICO [credit score](../c/credit_score.md). The primary objective of VantageScore is to provide lenders and other stakeholders with a consistent, accurate, and easier-to-understand [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring model that can efficiently evaluate the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of consumers.

VantageScore was first introduced in 2006 and has since undergone several updates to improve its predictive power and [utility](../u/utility.md) in the marketplace. With each iteration, enhancements are made to better serve both consumers and [credit](../c/credit.md) issuers by incorporating changes in consumer behavior and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). VantageScore is widely accepted by lenders, landlords, and other entities that need to assess [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) or financial reliability of individuals.

## VantageScore Model

The VantageScore model uses a complex algorithm that accounts for various factors affecting a consumer's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). While specific details of the algorithm are proprietary, VantageScore generally follows a similar structure as other [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models, but with notable differences and improvements. Here are some key aspects of the VantageScore model:

1. **[Range](../r/range.md)**:
   - The VantageScore model typically provides [credit](../c/credit.md) scores in a [range](../r/range.md) from 300 to 850, similar to the [FICO score](../f/fico_score.md) [range](../r/range.md). However, earlier versions of VantageScore used a different [range](../r/range.md), such as 501 to 990.

2. **Data Utilization**:
   - VantageScore employs data from the consumer's [credit report](../c/credit_report.md), including accounts, balances, [payment](../p/payment.md) histories, and [credit](../c/credit.md) inquiries. Importantly, it can generate scores with just one month of [credit](../c/credit.md) history and for as little as one account. This approach aims to include more people, especially those who are not traditionally covered by other [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models.

3. **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and Advanced Analytics**:
   - Recent versions of VantageScore incorporate [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and advanced analytics to improve the accuracy and predictiveness of the scores. These technologies help identify patterns and correlations in the data that may not be obvious through traditional statistical methods.

4. **Consistency Across [Credit](../c/credit.md) Bureaus**:
   - One of the significant benefits of VantageScore is its consistency. Because it was developed collaboratively by all three major [credit](../c/credit.md) bureaus, the scoring model is designed to deliver similar results regardless of which bureau's data is used.

5. **Regular Updates**:
   - The VantageScore model undergoes regular updates and revisions to reflect changes in consumer behavior, [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), regulatory requirements, and technological advancements. This dynamic updating process helps keep the score relevant and accurate over time.

## Components of VantageScore

Several factors contribute to the calculation of a VantageScore, each with a different level of influence on the final number. The factors used in VantageScore calculations can be grouped into major categories:

1. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) History** (41%):
   - [Payment](../p/payment.md) history is the most critical [factor](../f/factor.md) in determining a VantageScore. It includes information on whether the consumer has paid their bills on time, the presence of any late payments, and the severity and recency of any delinquencies or defaults.

2. **Age and Type of [Credit](../c/credit.md) ([Credit](../c/credit.md) Mix)** (20%):
   - This component evaluates the diversity and [duration](../d/duration.md) of the consumer's [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts. A mix of different types of [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts, such as [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, auto loans, and mortgages, generally contributes positively to the score.

3. **Total Balances and [Debt](../d/debt.md)** (20%):
   - This category measures the total amount of [debt](../d/debt.md) a consumer has and how it compares to their total available [credit](../c/credit.md) limits. High balances relative to [credit](../c/credit.md) limits can negatively impact the score.

4. **Recent [Credit](../c/credit.md) Behavior and Inquiries** (11%):
   - Recent [credit](../c/credit.md) behavior includes the number of [credit](../c/credit.md) inquiries and new accounts opened in the recent past. [Multiple](../m/multiple.md) inquiries or new accounts within a short time frame can be a red flag, indicating potential financial stress or [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking behavior.

5. **Available [Credit](../c/credit.md)** (3%):
   - The available [credit](../c/credit.md) [factor](../f/factor.md) looks at the total amount of [credit](../c/credit.md) a consumer has access to, but hasn’t used yet. Generally, having more available [credit](../c/credit.md) without substantial balances can positively influence the [credit score](../c/credit_score.md).

6. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Utilization**: 
   - This looks at the ratio of [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) balances to [credit](../c/credit.md) limits. Lower utilization rates, usually under 30%, are considered favorable.

It's important to [note](../n/note.md) that while these categories provide a general breakdown of the factors influencing VantageScore, the exact weightings and methodologies may vary slightly between different versions of the model.

## Comparing VantageScore with FICO Score

While VantageScore and [FICO Score](../f/fico_score.md) are both widely used [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models, there are key differences between the two:

1. **Score [Range](../r/range.md)**:
   - Both VantageScore and the latest version of FICO use a [range](../r/range.md) from 300 to 850, but earlier versions of VantageScore used different ranges.

2. **Minimum Criteria for Scoring**:
   - VantageScore can generate a score with as little as one month of [credit](../c/credit.md) history and one account. FICO, on the other hand, typically requires at least six months of [credit](../c/credit.md) history and at least one account reported in the last six months.

3. **Data Utilization**:
   - VantageScore often utilizes [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) techniques and can differentiate trends in consumer behavior more granularly, while FICO relies on tried-and-tested statistical models.

4. **Consistency Across [Credit](../c/credit.md) Bureaus**:
   - VantageScore aims for consistency across all three bureaus by using uniform algorithms and data treatment. FICO models can vary slightly depending on the bureau's data and version of the [FICO score](../f/fico_score.md) used.

5. **Focus Areas**:
   - VantageScore places a strong emphasis on including more consumers in its scoring model, such as those with limited [credit](../c/credit.md) histories. FICO also provides special models for consumers with limited [credit](../c/credit.md) histories, but its traditional scoring models require more comprehensive [credit](../c/credit.md) data.

## Conclusion

VantageScore is a [robust](../r/robust.md) and reliable [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring model [offering](../o/offering.md) several benefits over traditional models, including broader consumer inclusion and greater consistency across [credit](../c/credit.md) bureaus. With advancements in [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and regular updates, VantageScore continues to serve as a critical tool for evaluating [consumer credit](../c/consumer_credit.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) in an evolving financial landscape.
