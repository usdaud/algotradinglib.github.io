# Volume Spike

A volume spike is a sudden increase in trading volume compared to recent averages. It often signals heightened interest, news impact, or a major liquidity event.

## Example
A stock trades 500,000 shares per day on average. After an earnings release, volume reaches 5 million shares. This is a volume spike.

## Practical notes
Volume spikes can validate breakouts or reversals, but they can also mark exhaustion. Context is key.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Volume Spike and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Volume Spike as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Volume Spike, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Volume Spike. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Volume Spike alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
