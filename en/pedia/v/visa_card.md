## Types of Visa Cards

Visa cards come in different types based on their functionalities and the needs they cater to:

### 1. Visa Credit Card

Visa [credit](../c/credit.md) cards allow users to borrow [money](../m/money.md) from the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to make purchases or withdraw cash and then repay the borrowed amount along with [interest](../i/interest.md) and any applicable fees.

### 2. Visa Debit Card

Visa [debit](../d/debit.md) cards enable users to access funds directly from their [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts. They [offer](../o/offer.md) the convenience of electronic payments without the need for borrowing [money](../m/money.md).

### 3. Visa Prepaid Card

Visa prepaid cards are preloaded with a specific amount of [money](../m/money.md). Once the funds are depleted, the card can either be discarded or reloaded, depending on the type of prepaid card.

## How Visa Cards Work

Visa cards operate through an intricate process involving various parties, including the cardholder, merchant, acquiring [bank](../b/bank.md), issuing [bank](../b/bank.md), and Visa network. Here's a general overview of how a Visa card [transaction](../t/transaction.md) works:

1. **Authorization**: The cardholder presents their Visa card for [payment](../p/payment.md). The merchant's terminal sends the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) details to the acquiring [bank](../b/bank.md), which then forwards them to the Visa network.
2. **Authentication & Approval**: Visa sends the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) request to the issuing [bank](../b/bank.md) for authentication. If the cardholder has sufficient funds or [credit](../c/credit.md), the issuing [bank](../b/bank.md) approves the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
3. **Settlement**: Once authorized, the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is settled. The issuing [bank](../b/bank.md) transfers funds to the acquiring [bank](../b/bank.md) through the Visa network.
4. **[Reconciliation](../r/reconciliation.md)**: The acquiring [bank](../b/bank.md) credits the merchant's account for the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) amount, minus any processing fees.

## Security Features

Visa cards incorporate various [security](../s/security.md) features to protect against [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and unauthorized use:

### 1. EMV Chip

EMV (Europay, [MasterCard](../m/mastercard.md), and Visa) chips provide enhanced [security](../s/security.md) compared to traditional magnetic stripe cards. They generate a unique [transaction](../t/transaction.md) code for each [payment](../p/payment.md), making it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate.

### 2. Visa Secure

Visa Secure, formerly known as Verified by Visa, adds an extra layer of protection for online transactions. Cardholders are required to verify their identity through additional authentication steps.

### 3. Contactless Payments

Visa contactless cards allow for quick and secure payments by simply tapping the card on a contactless-enabled terminal. These payments use encryption to safeguard card information.

### 4. Zero Liability Policy

Visa's [Zero Liability Policy](../z/zero_liability_policy.md) protects cardholders from unauthorized transactions. If fraudulent activity is detected, cardholders are not held responsible for the unauthorized charges.
