# Volatility Arbitrage

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) (vol arb) is a type of statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategy that seeks to exploit discrepancies between the forecasted future [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) and the implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) embedded in the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s [options](../o/options.md). Traders using this strategy assume that the [market](../m/market.md) has incorrectly priced the [options](../o/options.md) based on assumptions about future [volatility](../v/volatility.md), providing opportunities for [profit](../p/profit.md) by taking positions that [will](../w/will.md) benefit when the actual [volatility](../v/volatility.md) deviates from what was implied by option prices.

### Core Concepts of Volatility Arbitrage

#### Implied vs. Realized Volatility

Implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) is derived from the prices of [options](../o/options.md) and represents the [market](../m/market.md)'s expectation of the future [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Realized or [historical volatility](../h/historical_volatility.md), on the other hand, measures the actual movement in the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price over a specified period. [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) traders analyze the gap between implied and [realized volatility](../r/realized_volatility.md) to predict the future movement of the [asset](../a/asset.md) and identify mispriced [options](../o/options.md).

#### Delta-Neutral Positions

A [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) position consists of offsetting positions in an option and its [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to ensure that the [delta](../d/delta.md) (the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)) is zero. This strategy minimizes exposure to the direction of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price movement, allowing traders to focus purely on [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

#### Gamma and Vega

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) measures the rate of change in [delta](../d/delta.md) relative to the change in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). High [gamma](../g/gamma.md) means the [delta](../d/delta.md) is very sensitive to price changes, which affects the stability of a [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) position. [Vega](../v/vega.md), on the other hand, measures the sensitivity of the option’s price to changes in the implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Understanding both [gamma](../g/gamma.md) and [vega](../v/vega.md) is essential for managing the risks associated with [volatility](../v/volatility.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies.

### Practical Application of Volatility Arbitrage

#### Identifying Mispricing

Traders use complex [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and algorithms to identify [options](../o/options.md) that are under- or over-priced based on their [volatility](../v/volatility.md) forecasts. Tools such as the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md), [GARCH models](../g/garch_models.md), and machine [learning algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) play a significant role in these analyses.

#### Execution

Once a potential opportunity is identified, a [trader](../t/trader.md) [will](../w/will.md) typically buy [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [options](../o/options.md) and/or sell [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) [options](../o/options.md) and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) the position by trading the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to maintain [delta](../d/delta.md) neutrality. The goal is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the convergence of implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to the [realized volatility](../r/realized_volatility.md) or the [correction](../c/correction.md) of the mispricing.

#### Risk Management

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is critical in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). It involves monitoring [gamma](../g/gamma.md) and [vega](../v/vega.md) exposures, ensuring [delta](../d/delta.md) neutrality through frequent adjustments (re-hedging), and having a clear [exit strategy](../e/exit_strategy.md) to avoid unexpected losses due to rapid [market](../m/market.md) changes.

### Examples of Volatility Arbitrage Strategies

#### Long Straddle

A [long straddle](../l/long_straddle.md) involves buying both a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) at the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) with the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This strategy profits from significant moves in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s price, regardless of direction, as long as the magnitude of the movement exceeds the cost of the [options](../o/options.md).

#### Short Straddle

Conversely, a [short straddle](../s/short_straddle.md) involves selling both a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) at the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). This strategy profits when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s price remains stable and the [options](../o/options.md) expire worthless. However, it carries high [risk](../r/risk.md) if the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price makes a large move.

#### Calendar Spread

A calendar spread involves buying and selling [options](../o/options.md) with different expiration dates. A [trader](../t/trader.md) might, for example, buy a longer-dated option and sell a shorter-dated option. This strategy profits from the rapid decay of the shorter-dated option's [premium](../p/premium.md) or changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) over time.
