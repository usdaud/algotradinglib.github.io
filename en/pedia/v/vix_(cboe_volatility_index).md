# VIX (CBOE Volatility Index)

The VIX, or CBOE [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md), often referred to as the "fear gauge" or "fear [index](../i/index_instrument.md)," is a real-time [market index](../m/market_index.md) that represents the [market](../m/market.md)'s expectations for [volatility](../v/volatility.md) over the coming 30 days. It is researched, developed, and maintained by the Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CBOE). The VIX measures the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md)'s expectation of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) implied by S&P 500 [index options](../i/index_options.md). By tracking the prices of these [options](../o/options.md), the VIX provides a metric for [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), specifically reflecting the anticipated [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

## Historical Background

The VIX was introduced in 1993 by the Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) and the methodology for deriving it has evolved over time. Initially, it was computed using the implied volatilities from eight different put and call [options](../o/options.md) on the S&P 100 ([OEX](../o/oex.md)) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md). With the advancement of financial instruments and the growing popularity of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) as an [asset class](../a/asset_class.md), the VIX was updated in 2003 to provide a more comprehensive and reliable measure. The updated VIX now uses the [options](../o/options.md) of the S&P 500 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) for its calculations, making it a more accurate reflection of [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Calculation Methodology

The VIX uses a wide [range](../r/range.md) of S&P 500 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (SPX) option prices to gauge [market](../m/market.md) expectations of future [volatility](../v/volatility.md). The key steps in the calculation of the VIX are as follows:

1. **Selection of [Options](../o/options.md)**:
 - The VIX is calculated using both near-term and next-term [options](../o/options.md) that expire in less than 37 days but more than 23 days.
 - Both call and [put options](../p/put_options.md) are utilized in the calculation.

2. **Calculation of Implied [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**:
 - The VIX uses out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) (OTM) [options](../o/options.md) because they are the best indicators of [market](../m/market.md) opinion about future [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
 - The chosen [options](../o/options.md) are then used to calculate an average of the expected [volatility](../v/volatility.md) over the next 30 days.

3. **[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md)**:
 - The VIX is essentially the square root of the [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) of the implied volatilities.

The exact formula used to calculate the VIX involves a complex series of steps that transform the prices of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [options](../o/options.md) into a single number that reflects the [market](../m/market.md)'s expectation of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) over the next month.

## Interpretation and Use

The VIX is interpreted as an annualized percentage, indicating the expected movement of the S&P 500 [index](../i/index_instrument.md) over the next 30 days. A high VIX [value](../v/value.md) indicates high expected [volatility](../v/volatility.md), often associated with increased fear or [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) in the [market](../m/market.md). Conversely, a low VIX [value](../v/value.md) suggests lower expected [volatility](../v/volatility.md), typically indicating [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence and stability.

- **VIX Level < 20**: Generally considered a stable and calm [market](../m/market.md).
- **VIX Level between 20-30**: Indicates moderate [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- **VIX Level > 30**: Signifies high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential [market](../m/market.md) turmoil.

Traders and investors use the VIX in various ways to guide their investment strategies. For example:
- Hedging: Investors might use [VIX options](../v/vix_option.md) or [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their portfolios against potential downturns.
- [Portfolio Management](../p/par.md): A spike in the VIX could prompt a re-evaluation of the portfolio's [risk](../r/risk.md) profile.
- [Speculation](../s/speculation.md): Traders may speculate on future [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) using VIX [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

## VIX Futures and Options

VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) provide a mechanism for investors to [trade](../t/trade.md) based on their expectations of future [volatility](../v/volatility.md). These financial instruments can be used for hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), and gaining exposure to [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### VIX Futures

VIX [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) were introduced in 2004 by the CBOE [Futures](../f/futures.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CFE). These contracts allow [market](../m/market.md) participants to [trade](../t/trade.md) on the expected [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the S&P 500 [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

- **Pricing**: The price of VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) is determined by the current level of the VIX and [market](../m/market.md) expectations of future [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- **Settlement**: These contracts typically settle in cash and are marketed with expiration dates that extend from days to months.

### VIX Options

Introduced in 2006, [VIX options](../v/vix_option.md) have become a popular tool among investors. These [options](../o/options.md) are based on the VIX and allow for various strategic plays, such as buying calls or puts depending on the [market](../m/market.md) outlook for [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

- **Call [Options](../o/options.md)**: Used to speculate that [volatility](../v/volatility.md) [will](../w/will.md) increase above a specified level.
- **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md)**: Used to speculate that [volatility](../v/volatility.md) [will](../w/will.md) decrease below a specified level.

## Volatility Products and Strategies

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) products like the VIX are used in various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Several [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs) and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Notes (ETNs) are based on the VIX, allowing for easier access to [volatility](../v/volatility.md) trading. Some of these products include:

- iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term [Futures](../f/futures.md) ETN (VXX)
- ProShares VIX Short-Term [Futures](../f/futures.md) ETF (VIXY)
- VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (TVIX)

### Common Volatility Trading Strategies

1. **[Straddle](../s/straddle.md) Strategy**: Involves buying both a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) on the VIX with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), benefiting from significant moves in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) regardless of direction.
2. **Calendar Spread**: Entails buying and selling [VIX options](../v/vix_option.md) of different expiration months but the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), profiting from changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) term structure.
3. **[Volatility Arbitrage](../v/volatility_arbitrage.md)**: Involves taking advantage of the discrepancies between the implied volatilities used in pricing different financial instruments.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the VIX serves as a valuable input for models that predict [market](../m/market.md) movements and [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Many [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md) incorporate the VIX to manage or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) risks, enhance [market](../m/market.md) predictions, and optimize portfolio returns.

### Use Cases of VIX in Algo Trading

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Algo traders use the VIX to calibrate [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking parameters in their models, dynamically adjusting exposure based on anticipated [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
2. **[Market Timing](../m/market_timing.md)**: By integrating VIX levels with [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), traders can optimize entry and exit points based on [volatility](../v/volatility.md) forecasts.
3. **Combining with Other Indicators**: The VIX is often combined with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) to create [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading models](../t/trading_models.md) that respond to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
