# VINX 30

The VINX 30 is a stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) that represents the 30 most traded [stocks](../s/stock.md) on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Nordic [exchange](../e/exchange.md). It combines companies from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, [offering](../o/offering.md) a comprehensive view of the Nordic region's [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) performance. The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) serves as a barometer for the economic health and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) of one of the world's most prosperous regions. 

## Composition and Calculation

The VINX 30 is a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md), which means that each constituent's weight in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is proportional to its [market value](../m/market_value.md). The larger the company's [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), the greater its impact on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md). The calculation involves several steps:

1. **Selection of Constituents**: The 30 most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) and high-[market](../m/market.md)-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md) from the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Nordic [exchange](../e/exchange.md) are selected. [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) is typically measured by the [volume](../v/volume.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) traded and the frequency of trading.
2. **Weighting**: Each stock is assigned a weight based on its [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) relative to the total [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of all 30 [stocks](../s/stock.md).
3. **Formula**: The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) level is calculated by dividing the total [market value](../m/market_value.md) of all constituent [stocks](../s/stock.md) by the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) divisor, which is adjusted for stock splits, dividends, or other corporate actions to maintain consistency.

## Rebalancing

During [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md), [stocks](../s/stock.md) may be added or removed, and the weights of the constituent [stocks](../s/stock.md) are adjusted according to the latest [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) data.
