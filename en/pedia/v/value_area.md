# Value Area

Value area is a market profile concept that refers to the price range where a specified percentage of volume or time was traded during a session, often 70 percent. It represents the area of most accepted prices for that period.

## Key levels
- Value Area High (VAH): the upper boundary.
- Value Area Low (VAL): the lower boundary.
- Point of Control (POC): the price with the highest activity.

## Example
A futures session trades most of its volume between 3980 and 4020. That range is the value area. Traders use it to identify acceptance or rejection around those levels.

## Practical notes
Value area is used with market profile or volume profile tools. It helps frame support, resistance, and potential mean reversion.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Value Area and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Value Area as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Value Area, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Value Area. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Value Area alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
