#### Rise of VC in Emerging Markets
Emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are seeing increased [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) activity. This [trend](../t/trend.md) is driven by rapid [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), urbanization, and the proliferation of digital technologies.
