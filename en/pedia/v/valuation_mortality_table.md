# Valuation Mortality Table

A [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) [Mortality Table](../m/mortality_table.md) is a critical tool in the fields of [actuarial science](../a/actuarial_science.md), [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md), and [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md). It is designed to provide estimates on the likelihood of death for individuals at various ages, as well as the associated financial implications. Understanding how to read, interpret, and apply [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) Mortality Tables is essential for actuaries and financial professionals to properly price [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products, create pension plans, and perform other tasks related to [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and long-term [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

## Definition and Purpose

A [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) [Mortality Table](../m/mortality_table.md) is a statistical table used to estimate the probability of death for individuals within certain age groups. These tables are created based on historical data and are used to predict future mortality trends. The main purposes of a [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) [Mortality Table](../m/mortality_table.md) include:

- **Pricing [Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) Products**: Insurers rely on these tables to set premiums for [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies. By understanding the likelihood of death, insurers can more accurately assess [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Pension Planning**: Pension plans and annuities use mortality tables to estimate how long participants [will](../w/will.md) live and, therefore, how long payments [will](../w/will.md) need to be made.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Various financial products and services, including long-term care [insurance](../i/insurance.md) and [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md), utilize mortality tables to anticipate costs and set aside appropriate reserves.

## Components of a Valuation Mortality Table

A [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) [Mortality Table](../m/mortality_table.md) typically includes the following columns:

- **Age**: The age of the individuals considered in the table.
- **qx (Mortality Rate)**: The probability that an individual of a given age [will](../w/will.md) die before reaching the next age.
- **lx (Number of Lives)**: The number of individuals alive at the beginning of the age interval.
- **dx (Number of Deaths)**: The number of individuals expected to die within the age interval.
- **px (Survival Probability)**: The probability that an individual of a given age [will](../w/will.md) survive to the next age.

### Sample Structure

| Age | qx       | lx       | dx       | px       |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 0   | 0.005    | 100,000  | 500      | 0.995    |
| 1   | 0.0004   | 99,500   | 40       | 0.9996   |
| 2   | 0.0003   | 99,460   | 30       | 0.9997   |
| ... | ...      | ...      | ...      | ...      |
| 65  | 0.011    | 40,000   | 440      | 0.989    |

## Types of Mortality Tables

[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) Mortality Tables can be categorized based on the specific application and the population being studied. Here are a few common types:

- **Ultimate Mortality Tables**: These provide mortality rates that assume a person has survived the [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) process and is now part of a more homogeneous population.
- **Select Mortality Tables**: These tables provide mortality rates for newly underwritten lives and typically account for the first several years after [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md).
- **Static Tables**: These tables use a snapshot of data from a specific period and do not account for trends over time.
- **Generational Tables**: Also known as cohort tables, these take into account improvements in mortality over time.

## How Mortality Tables Are Constructed

The process of constructing a [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) [Mortality Table](../m/mortality_table.md) involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering historical data on the age-specific mortality experience of a population.
2. **[Data Cleaning](../d/data_cleaning.md)**: Removing inconsistencies and inaccuracies from the data.
3. **Experience Analysis**: Analyzing the data to identify trends and anomalies.
4. **Graduation**: Smoothing the raw data to create a more stable and reliable table.
5. **Validation**: Comparing the constructed table against other known data sources to ensure accuracy.

## Applications in Financial Planning

### Life Insurance

[Life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) companies use [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) Mortality Tables to determine the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with insuring an individual. By knowing the likelihood of death at different ages, insurers can set premiums that are sufficient to cover the expected claims while also providing a [profit margin](../p/profit_margin.md).

### Pension Plans

Pension planners use mortality tables to calculate the expected [duration](../d/duration.md) of pension payments. This helps in determining the amount of contributions required to [fund](../f/fund.md) future liabilities.

### Annuities

Annuity providers utilize mortality tables to price their products. The tables help in predicting how long annuitants [will](../w/will.md) live and therefore how long payments [will](../w/will.md) need to last.

### Risk Management

In the broader field of [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), financial analysts use mortality tables to assess the potential impact of mortality [risk](../r/risk.md) on various investment and savings plans.

## Advances in Mortality Modelling

Recent advancements in computational power and [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) have led to more sophisticated methods for constructing and using mortality tables. Some of these advances include:

- **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md)**: The use of [machine learning algorithms](../m/machine_learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) to identify patterns and trends in mortality data that traditional methods may miss.
- **Dynamic Modelling**: Developing models that can adapt over time as new data becomes available, leading to more accurate predictions.
- **[Big Data](../b/big_data_in_trading.md)**: Leveraging large datasets to improve the reliability and granularity of mortality tables.

### Software Tools

Various [software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) are available to help actuaries and financial professionals use mortality tables effectively:
