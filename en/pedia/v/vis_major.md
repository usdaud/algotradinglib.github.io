# Vis Major

## Introduction

"Vis Major" is a Latin term that translates to "greater force" and is commonly referred to in the fields of law, [finance](../f/finance.md), and any [industry](../i/industry.md) where contracts play a pivotal role. In legal contexts, it denotes an unavoidable catastrophe that cannot be anticipated or controlled, which significantly hinders or halts the ability to fulfill contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md). These forces can include natural disasters, wars, or other unpredictable events that are beyond human control.

## Legal Definition and Scope

In legal terminology, "Vis Major" often overlaps with the term "[Force Majeure](../f/force_majeure.md)," though they are not synonymous. "Vis Major" is specifically concerned with natural incidents like earthquakes, hurricanes, or other acts of God, whereas "[Force Majeure](../f/force_majeure.md)" can encompass both natural and human-induced events like strikes and acts of terrorism. The key aspect is the unforeseeable and insurmountable nature of these disruptions, which make it impossible to comply with the contractual terms.

### Key Elements

1. **Unforeseeability**: The event must be unexpected and not reasonably anticipated.
2. **Irresistibility**: The event must be beyond control and insurmountable.
3. **[Externality](../e/externality.md)**: The cause must be external to the parties involved in the [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Examples

- Natural Disasters: Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes.
- Human Actions: War, terrorism, but more commonly categorized under "[Force Majeure](../f/force_majeure.md)."
- Government Actions: Changes in law or regulation that explicitly prevent contractual performance.

## Implications in Contracts

Contracts often include a "[Force Majeure](../f/force_majeure.md)" clause that outlines the [scope](../s/scope.md) of events considered as "Vis Major." This clause typically specifies what constitutes an excusable delay or non-performance and the subsequent rights and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of the parties involved.

### Contractual Elements

1. **Definition Clause**: Specifies what events are considered under "Vis Major."
2. **Notification Requirement**: Obligates the affected party to inform the other party within a specified timeframe.
3. **Mitigation Requirement**: Obligates the affected party to take reasonable steps to mitigate the impact.
4. **Consequences**: Outlines the relief available, such as suspension of [obligations](../o/obligation.md), extension of time, or termination without [liability](../l/liability.md).

## Impact on Finance and Trading

In [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, "Vis Major" events can lead to significant [market](../m/market.md) disruptions. Understanding the concept is crucial for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and strategy formulation.

### Financial Instruments

1. **[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md)**: Contracts such as [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) often include "[Force Majeure](../f/force_majeure.md)" clauses to address "Vis Major" events.
2. **Bonds and Loans**: Clauses that allow for deferment of payments or [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) in case of such events.
3. **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md)**: Policies may explicitly cover or exclude "Vis Major" events.

### Risk Management

- **Hedging**: Using financial instruments to mitigate risks arising from potential "Vis Major" events.
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Spreading investments across different sectors to minimize impact.
- **Scenario Planning**: Developing [contingency](../c/contingency.md) plans for various "Vis Major" scenarios.

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Hurricane Katrina

In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused unprecedented destruction, leading to numerous declarations of "Vis Major" by affected businesses. [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) claims soared and many contracts were either renegotiated or terminated.

### Case 2: COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a modern example of "Vis Major," where global lockdowns and economic disruptions led to massive contractual non-performance claims. Many businesses invoked "[Force Majeure](../f/force_majeure.md)" clauses to manage their liabilities and [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Conclusion

Understanding "Vis Major" is crucial for navigating the complexities of contracts and financial instruments, especially in unpredictable and volatile environments. While it primarily provides legal relief, the broader implications on [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) emphasize the need for detailed [contingency](../c/contingency.md) planning in contracts and financial strategies.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Vis Major and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.
