# Value Area High (VAH)

Value area high is the upper boundary of the value area, the range where most volume or time was traded in a session. It is a market profile reference level.

## Interpretation
- Price acceptance above VAH can signal bullish sentiment.
- Failure to hold above VAH can signal rejection and mean reversion.

## Example
The value area for a session is 100 to 105. The VAH is 105. If price breaks above 105 and holds, traders may treat it as strength.

## Practical notes
VAH is most useful when combined with value area low and point of control to frame the session structure.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Value Area High (VAH) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Value Area High (VAH) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Value Area High (VAH), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Value Area High (VAH). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Value Area High (VAH) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
