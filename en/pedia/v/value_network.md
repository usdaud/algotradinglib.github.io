# Value Network

[Value](../v/value.md) Network is a concept coined to address the complex web of relationships and [value](../v/value.md) exchanges within any organization or economic system. It transcends the traditional linear [value chain](../v/value_chain.md) by integrating both tangible and intangible exchanges that contribute to the creation, delivery, and [optimization](../o/optimization.md) of [value](../v/value.md). While the concept of the [value](../v/value.md) network has broad applications across various fields, its relevance and application in trading, financial technology (fintech), and particularly [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algotrading) can provide unique insights into the intricate eco-systems of [finance](../f/finance.md).

## Understanding Value Network

At its core, a [value](../v/value.md) network comprises a set of roles and interactions that result in the delivery of a particular [value](../v/value.md) outcome. It includes both internal and external stakeholders who participate in the creation and delivery of [value](../v/value.md). This encompasses suppliers, customers, partners, regulators, technologies, and even competitors.

### Components of a Value Network

1. **Nodes**: These are entities or stakeholders that interact within the network. Nodes can be businesses, individuals, machines, or even software algorithms in the case of fintech.
  
2. **Links**: Links represent the relationships between nodes, which could be physical, financial, emotional, or informational. For example, in a financial trading network, the links could be data feeds, trading orders, or [customer](../c/customer.md) feedback.

3. **Flows**: The exchanges and transactions occurring between the nodes, including information, goods, services, and [money](../m/money.md). These flows can be bidirectional and dynamic.

### Types of Value in a Value Network

[Value](../v/value.md) in a network can be classified into several types:
  
1. **Tangible [Value](../v/value.md)**: This includes measurable and quantifiable assets, such as financial [capital](../c/capital.md), products, and services.

2. **Intangible [Value](../v/value.md)**: Intangible assets include knowledge, intellectual property, brand reputation, and [customer](../c/customer.md) loyalty. Especially in fintech and trading, data and [proprietary algorithms](../p/proprietary_algorithms.md) are significant intangible assets contributing to [value](../v/value.md) generation.

3. **Social [Value](../v/value.md)**: Relationships, [trust](../t/trust.md), and [corporate culture](../c/corporate_culture.md) are categorized under social [value](../v/value.md), impacting how efficiently and effectively [value](../v/value.md) is created and exchanged.
