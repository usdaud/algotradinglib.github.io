# Variable-Rate Certificate of Deposit

A Variable-Rate Certificate of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) (variable-rate CD) is a type of savings instrument offered by banks and financial institutions that provides a [return](../r/return.md) on investment based on a changing [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md). Unlike traditional fixed-rate CDs, which have a stagnant [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) throughout their term, variable-rate CDs [offer](../o/offer.md) flexible [interest](../i/interest.md) rates that can adjust periodically. This guide explores the fundamentals, benefits, and pitfalls, as well as practical considerations for [investing](../i/investing.md) in variable-rate CDs.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## Fundamentals of Variable-Rate CDs

Variable-rate CDs are time deposits, which means they entail a commitment to leave a specific amount of [money](../m/money.md) invested for a predetermined time period. The key differentiator, however, is their [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), which can fluctuate based on various indexes or benchmarks, such as the U.S. [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md), the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

### **How Variable Rates Are Determined**

Variable-rate CDs can be pegged to [multiple](../m/multiple.md) financial indicators:
1. **[Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md)**: Often used by banks when lending to their most creditworthy customers.
2. **[Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md)**: The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions lend balances to each other overnight.
3. **LIBOR**: A widely-used [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for short-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates worldwide.

The frequency of rate adjustments can vary. Some CDs may adjust monthly, quarterly, or annually. Before [investing](../i/investing.md), it's crucial to understand how often these changes [will](../w/will.md) occur.

### **Terms and Maturity**

Just like their fixed-rate counterparts, variable-rate CDs have set terms typically ranging from a few months to several years. Upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md), an [investor](../i/investor.md) can choose to either withdraw their funds or reinvest them into another CD.

## Benefits of Variable-Rate CDs

Investors often turn to variable-rate CDs for several advantages:

1. **Potential for Higher Returns**: When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [yield](../y/yield.md) on a variable-rate CD can increase, potentially [offering](../o/offering.md) more attractive returns compared to fixed-rate CDs.
2. **[Inflation Hedge](../i/inflation_hedge.md)**: Variable rates can help protect investors from [inflation](../i/inflation.md), as rising rates tend to correspond with inflationary environments.
3. **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Holding a mix of fixed- and variable-rate CDs can [offer](../o/offer.md) a balance between stability and potential growth in a diversified portfolio.

### **Example Scenario**

Consider an [investor](../i/investor.md) purchasing a two-year variable-rate CD tied to the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) plus 1%, adjusting quarterly. If the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) is 3% at the time of purchase, the initial [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) would be 4%. If the [Prime Rate](../p/prime_rate.md) increases to 4% after six months, the CD's rate would adjust to 5%.

## Pitfalls and Risks

While variable-rate CDs present numerous benefits, they also carry inherent risks and limitations:

1. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: If [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall, the returns could be less attractive than those of a fixed-rate CD.
2. **Complexity**: Understanding the specific terms and the factors driving rate adjustments can be complex.
3. **Early [Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) Penalties**: Like all CDs, withdrawing funds before the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) typically incurs penalties, which could [offset](../o/offset.md) earned [interest](../i/interest.md).

## Practical Considerations

### **Understanding Terms and Conditions**

Before [investing](../i/investing.md), review the CD's [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) statement carefully, which should outline:
- The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) or [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) the CD's rate is tied to.
- The frequency of rate adjustments.
- Any rate caps or floors.
- Early [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) penalties.

### **Comparing with Fixed-Rate CDs**

Performing a comparison between fixed-rate and variable-rate CDs involves evaluating the current [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment and future rate expectations. If rates are low but expected to rise, variable-rate CDs might be more appealing. Conversely, if rates are high and likely to fall, fixed-rate CDs can lock in higher returns for the term.

### **Institutional Reputation**

Ensure you are [investing](../i/investing.md) through a reputable financial institution:
- **Bankrate** provides reviews and comparisons of CDs available from various banks.
- **FDIC** insures deposits, [offering](../o/offering.md) safety and [security](../s/security.md) up to the coverage limit.

### Example of Reputable Institutions

- **Ally [Bank](../b/bank.md)**: Known for competitive rates and comprehensive terms. More details at Ally Bank.
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) One 360**: Offers a [range](../r/range.md) of CD [options](../o/options.md) with varying terms and rates. More information at Capital One 360.

## Conclusion

Variable-rate CDs [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique balance between [risk](../r/risk.md) and potential reward in an ever-evolving [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment. By understanding their mechanics, benefits, and pitfalls, investors can make informed decisions, leveraging these instruments to enhance their savings strategies while navigating the complexities of fluctuating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
