# Volume At Price

Volume at price shows how much volume traded at each price level over a period. It is used to identify areas of high activity and potential support or resistance.

## Interpretation
- High volume nodes indicate price acceptance.
- Low volume nodes indicate rejection or faster movement through that area.

## Example
A volume profile shows heavy volume around 250 and light volume between 255 and 260. Traders may view 250 as a support zone and 255-260 as a potential fast move area.

## Practical notes
Volume at price is usually visualized with volume profile charts. It is most powerful when combined with session context and market structure.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Volume At Price and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Volume At Price as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Volume At Price, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Volume At Price. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Volume At Price alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
