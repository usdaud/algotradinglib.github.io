# Veterans Administration

The Veterans Administration, commonly known as the VA, is a U.S. government agency that provides essential services to military veterans. Established in 1930, the VA is tasked with ensuring that veterans receive the healthcare, benefits, and support they require after serving in the armed forces.

## History and Evolution

The Veterans Administration was originally founded as the Veterans Bureau in 1921 but was reorganized into the Veterans Administration in 1930.

In 1989, the Veterans Administration was elevated to a Cabinet-level agency and was renamed the Department of Veterans Affairs.
