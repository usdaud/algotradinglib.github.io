# Value Change

In the realms of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, understanding the concept of "[value](../v/value.md) change" is pivotal to grasping the fundamental movements within markets. The term "[value](../v/value.md) change" refers to the variation in the [value](../v/value.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) over a specific period. This is crucial for traders, investors, and financial analysts to evaluate since it helps in [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) future price movements, assessing the health of an [asset](../a/asset.md), and making informed investment decisions.

## Historical Context of Value Change

The historical context of [value](../v/value.md) change can be traced back to the early days of [trade](../t/trade.md) when bartering was predominant. As soon as [currency](../c/currency.md) and formalized markets were introduced, tracking the change in [value](../v/value.md) became essential. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), established in 1896, is one of the earliest methods created to measure [value](../v/value.md) change in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). Historical study of [value](../v/value.md) change provides insights into [market](../m/market.md) trends, [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md), and financial crises.

## Measurement of Value Change

The measurement of [value](../v/value.md) change involves comparing the current price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) to its previous price or a specific [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md). This can be done using various metrics:

1. **Absolute Change**: The simplest form of measuring [value](../v/value.md) change, it is the difference between the current [value](../v/value.md) and the previous [value](../v/value.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md).
   
2. **[Percentage Change](../p/percentage_change.md)**: This shows the relative change in [value](../v/value.md) as a percentage, allowing for easier comparison across different assets.
   
3. **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**: This shows the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period longer than a year.
   
4. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: This measures the degree of variation of a trading price series over time and is crucial for understanding potential [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Example Calculation

If an [asset](../a/asset.md) was priced at $100 and rose to $120, the absolute change would be $20, and the [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) would be 20% ($20 increase on a $100 base).

## Factors Influencing Value Change

Understanding the myriad of factors that influence [value](../v/value.md) change is crucial for making predictive assessments in trading and [finance](../f/finance.md):

1. **[Supply](../s/supply.md) and [Demand](../d/demand.md)**: Fundamental economic principles dictate that if [demand](../d/demand.md) exceeds [supply](../s/supply.md), prices rise, and vice versa.
   
2. **[Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md)**: Psychological factors and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment can drive price changes based on speculative behavior.
   
3. **[Economic Indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md)**: Data such as GDP [growth rates](../g/growth_rates_in_trading.md), employment figures, and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) can affect [asset](../a/asset.md) values.
   
4. **Geopolitical Events**: Political stability, wars, and international relations can cause significant fluctuations in [asset](../a/asset.md) values.
   
5. **Corporate Performance**: For [stocks](../s/stock.md), the performance of the issuing company, reflected in [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, dividends, and management decisions, is critical.
   
6. **Regulatory Changes**: New laws and regulations can positively or negatively impact [asset](../a/asset.md) prices.

## Importance of Value Change in Trading Strategies

[Value](../v/value.md) change is the cornerstone of many [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md):

1. **[Technical Analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md)**: Traders use historical [value](../v/value.md) changes along with patterns and indicators to predict future price movements.
   
2. **[Fundamental Analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md)**: Investors analyze [underlying](../u/underlying.md) determinants of [value](../v/value.md) change, such as [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and macroeconomic factors, to make investment decisions.
   
3. **[Quantitative Trading](../q/quantitative_trading.md)**: Algorithmic traders use complex models that incorporate [value](../v/value.md) changes to execute trades at optimal times.
