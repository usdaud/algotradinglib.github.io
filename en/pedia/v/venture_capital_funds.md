# Venture Capital Funds

[Venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) (VC) funds are investment vehicles that provide [capital](../c/capital.md) to startups and early-stage companies with high growth potential. This type of funding is crucial for innovative enterprises that typically lack access to traditional [financing](../f/financing.md) due to high [risk](../r/risk.md) and [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). [Venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) is a subset of [private equity](../p/private_equity.md), but it focuses specifically on new and emerging companies. Here's a detailed exploration of [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) funds, covering their structure, operations, benefits, risks, and examples of notable VC firms.

## Structure of Venture Capital Funds

### Limited Partners (LPs) and General Partners (GPs)
[Venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) funds are usually structured as limited partnerships, comprising limited partners (LPs) and general partners (GPs). LPs are typically institutional investors such as pension funds, endowments, and wealthy individuals. They provide the majority of the [capital](../c/capital.md) but have [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) and minimal involvement in the day-to-day operations of the [fund](../f/fund.md).

GPs, on the other hand, manage the [fund](../f/fund.md) and make decisions regarding investments. They are responsible for identifying potential investment opportunities, conducting [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md), negotiating deal terms, and actively working with portfolio companies to enhance [value](../v/value.md).

### Fundraising
Raising a [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) involves GPs pitching to potential LPs to secure [capital](../c/capital.md) commitments. Fundraising can take several months to a couple of years, depending on the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s target size, track record, and [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Once commitments are secured, a formal [fund](../f/fund.md) closing occurs, enabling the GPs to start deploying [capital](../c/capital.md).

### Fund Terms
The terms of a [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) are outlined in a limited partnership agreement (LPA). Key terms include:

- **[Fund](../f/fund.md) Size:** The total amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) the [fund](../f/fund.md) aims to raise.
- **Investment Period:** The time frame during which the [fund](../f/fund.md) [will](../w/will.md) actively make new investments, typically lasting 3-5 years.
- **[Fund](../f/fund.md) Life:** The total [duration](../d/duration.md) of the [fund](../f/fund.md), usually around 10 years, with possible extensions.
- **Management Fees:** Annual fees (usually 2% of committed [capital](../c/capital.md)) paid to the GPs to cover operational expenses.
- **[Carried Interest](../c/carried_interest.md):** A portion of the profits (typically 20%) that GPs receive as compensation beyond management fees.

## Operations of Venture Capital Funds

### Deal Sourcing
VC funds rely on a variety of channels to source investment opportunities, including [industry](../i/industry.md) connections, [networking](../n/networking.md) events, [startup](../s/startup.md) accelerators, incubators, and pitch competitions. Proactive GPs often scout for promising startups in emerging markets and sectors.

### Due Diligence
[Due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) is a critical phase where GPs evaluate the potential of a [startup](../s/startup.md). This process involves analyzing the company's [business](../b/business.md) model, [market](../m/market.md) opportunity, competitive landscape, financials, and team. The goal is to assess the likelihood of achieving high returns.

### Investment Decisions
Investment decisions are typically made by an investment committee within the VC [firm](../f/firm.md). Once a target company passes the [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) process, the committee evaluates the risks and rewards, considers strategic alignment with the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s objectives, and makes the final call.

### Post-Investment Support
After [investing](../i/investing.md), VCs often take an active role in the company by providing strategic [guidance](../g/guidance.md), mentoring, introducing valuable networks, and helping with follow-on fundraising. This level of involvement aims to enhance the company's growth trajectory and increase the likelihood of a successful exit.

### Exits
Exiting investments is how VCs realize returns. Common exit strategies include:

- **Initial Public [Offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO):** When a company goes public, [shares](../s/shares.md) are sold on a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to investors.
- **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A):** When a company is acquired by another company, resulting in a cash or stock [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
- **Secondary Sales:** Selling [shares](../s/shares.md) to other investors or funds, providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) before a public [offering](../o/offering.md) or [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

## Benefits of Venture Capital

### Access to Capital
For startups and early-stage companies, [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) provides crucial funding that is often unavailable through traditional sources like [bank](../b/bank.md) loans, especially given the high [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with unproven [business models](../b/business_models.md).

### Strategic Support
Beyond [capital](../c/capital.md), VCs [offer](../o/offer.md) strategic [guidance](../g/guidance.md), mentorship, [industry](../i/industry.md) expertise, and valuable connections that can greatly enhance a [startup](../s/startup.md)’s chances of success.

### Accelerated Growth
With substantial funding and expert backing, startups can scale much faster than they would through bootstrapping or less substantial funding sources. This acceleration can be crucial in highly competitive markets.

### Risk Sharing
VC funding allows entrepreneurs to share the [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) of their ventures. If the [startup](../s/startup.md) fails, the financial loss is borne by the VC [fund](../f/fund.md) rather than the founders alone.

## Risks of Venture Capital

### Dilution of Ownership
When startups raise [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md), they [issue](../i/issue.md) [equity](../e/equity.md) to investors, resulting in ownership [dilution](../d/dilution.md) for the founding team. This can potentially reduce the founders' control and share of future profits.

### High Expectations
VCs expect high returns on their investments, which can create pressure on startups to achieve rapid growth and profitability, often leading to aggressive [business](../b/business.md) tactics and strategic pivots.

### Loss of Autonomy
VCs often negotiate for board seats and other control rights, which can lead to a significant influence over company decisions. Founders may have to cede some degree of control to their investors.

### Funding Rounds and Valuation Pressure
Subsequent funding rounds can come with their own set of pressures, including maintaining high valuations and consistently meeting aggressive growth milestones set by earlier investors.
