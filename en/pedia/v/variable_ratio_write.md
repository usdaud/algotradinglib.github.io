# Variable Ratio Write

The concept of a "Variable Ratio Write" pertains to a specific [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) where an [investor](../i/investor.md) holds a certain number of [shares](../s/shares.md) (also known as a long stock position) and sells call [options](../o/options.md) at different strike prices or quantities against those [shares](../s/shares.md). This strategy aims to generate additional [income](../i/income.md) or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) existing stock positions, although it can also increase [risk](../r/risk.md) due to the unlimited potential losses if the stock price rises significantly above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the call [options](../o/options.md) sold.

## Introduction

The Variable Ratio Write strategy is a sophisticated trading tactic that falls under the larger umbrella of [options trading strategies](../o/options_trading_strategies.md). It involves selling (writing) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) call [options](../o/options.md) at different strike prices against a long [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Unlike a traditional [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) strategy where an [investor](../i/investor.md) sells one [call option](../c/call_option.md) for every 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) owned, a Variable Ratio Write may involve selling a different number of call [options](../o/options.md), and those [options](../o/options.md) may be at various strike prices.

### Key Elements
1. **Long Stock Position**: The [investor](../i/investor.md) must own [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock.
2. **[Multiple](../m/multiple.md) Call [Options](../o/options.md)**: The [investor](../i/investor.md) sells call [options](../o/options.md) in different quantities and/or at different strike prices.
3. **[Income](../i/income.md) and [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: The strategy aims to generate [income](../i/income.md) from premiums received from selling call [options](../o/options.md), but it involves a balance of [income](../i/income.md) generation and [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure.

## Mechanism of Variable Ratio Write

### Structure
To undertake a Variable Ratio Write, an [investor](../i/investor.md) follows these steps:
1. **[Acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: The [investor](../i/investor.md) buys or holds a certain number of [shares](../s/shares.md) in a stock.
2. **Selling Call [Options](../o/options.md)**: The [investor](../i/investor.md) sells different call [options](../o/options.md) against the [shares](../s/shares.md). The ratio of call [options](../o/options.md) sold to [shares](../s/shares.md) owned can vary, and the strike prices can be staggered.

For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) possess 200 [shares](../s/shares.md) of XYZ stock, they might sell three call [options](../o/options.md) with strike prices of $50, $55, and $60 respectively. The ratio here is not 1:1 (one call per 100 [shares](../s/shares.md)), as in a traditional [covered call](../c/covered_call.md), but it varies, hence the name "Variable Ratio Write."

### Example

Let’s break down an example for clarity:

- **Long Stock Position**: Own 200 [shares](../s/shares.md) of XYZ, currently priced at $45 per share.
- **Sold Call [Options](../o/options.md)**:
 - Sell 2 call [options](../o/options.md) at a $50 [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) (near-the-[money](../m/money.md))
 - Sell 1 [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a $55 [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) (out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md))

In this scenario, if XYZ stock rises,:
- Up to $50: The 2 calls at the $50 strike [will](../w/will.md) be exercised, obligating the [investor](../i/investor.md) to sell 200 [shares](../s/shares.md) at $50, regardless of how high the stock price goes. However, the $55 call [will](../w/will.md) remain unexercised.
- Between $50 and $55: Only the remaining call [will](../w/will.md) be exercised, and the [investor](../i/investor.md) sells those 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) at $55.
- Above $55: All [shares](../s/shares.md) can be called away, and the [investor](../i/investor.md) might be exposed to losses on additional call [options](../o/options.md) sold.

## Pros and Cons of Variable Ratio Write

### Advantages

1. **[Premium](../p/premium.md) [Income](../i/income.md)**: Selling [multiple](../m/multiple.md) call [options](../o/options.md) generates more [premium](../p/premium.md) [income](../i/income.md) than a simple [covered call](../c/covered_call.md).
2. **Flexible Hedging**: The ability to sell [options](../o/options.md) at different strike prices allows for more nuanced hedging of the long stock position.
3. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential**: If the stock remains below the strike prices of the call [options](../o/options.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) profits from the [premium](../p/premium.md) without losing stock.

### Disadvantages

1. **Unlimited Loss [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: If the stock price soars well above the highest [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the calls, potential losses can be significant.
2. **Complex Management**: This strategy involves complexities in managing [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [options](../o/options.md) at various strike prices.
3. **Requires Close Monitoring**: Constant monitoring of the stock’s performance is necessary to adjust or exit positions and mitigate potential losses.

## Practical Considerations

### Market Sentiments and Volatility
- **Bullish to [Neutral](../n/neutral.md)**: Ideally, this strategy suits a bullish to [neutral](../n/neutral.md) [market](../m/market.md) outlook. If the [investor](../i/investor.md) expects modest price movements or a slight [uptick](../u/uptick.md) in the stock, this strategy can perform well.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: In highly volatile markets, the [risk](../r/risk.md) of the stock price moving significantly beyond strike prices may necessitate additional strategies, such as rolling [options](../o/options.md) or additional hedging measures.

### Brokerage Fees and Transaction Costs
- **Higher Costs**: Engaging in Variable Ratio Writes can incur higher transactional costs due to [multiple](../m/multiple.md) positions, including brokerage fees for buying and selling [options](../o/options.md) and [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Depending on the brokerage, [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements may apply, increasing the [capital](../c/capital.md) needed to maintain positions.

### Example of Execution

Consider an [investor](../i/investor.md) who owns 500 [shares](../s/shares.md) of ABC Corp, trading at $100 per share:
1. **Long Stock**: 500 [shares](../s/shares.md).
2. **Sell Calls**:
 - 2 call [options](../o/options.md) at $105 strike
 - 3 call [options](../o/options.md) at $110 strike

- **[Scenario Analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md)**:
 - **Stock stays below $105**: All [options](../o/options.md) expire worthless, and the [investor](../i/investor.md) keeps premia.
 - **Stock hits $107**: The $105 [options](../o/options.md) are exercised, requiring the [investor](../i/investor.md) to sell 200 [shares](../s/shares.md) at $105 while retaining 300 [shares](../s/shares.md).
 - **Stock hits $111**: All [options](../o/options.md) are exercised. Calls at $105 and $110 are utilized, requiring sales but exposing the gap between only $105 and the higher trading price for additional losses.

### Adjustment Strategies

Variable Ratio Writes require dynamic adjustments like:
1. **Rolling [Options](../o/options.md)**: Extending the life of [options](../o/options.md) by buying back the near-expiry ones and selling further dated work to manage positions.
2. **Adjusting Strike Prices**: Selling [options](../o/options.md) with higher strike prices if the [market](../m/market.md) trends upward to balance premiums and [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure.

### Key Differences with Traditional Covered Calls

1. **Strike Prices and Ratios**: Covered Calls have a simple 1:1 ratio and single [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), creating limited complexity.
2. **Flexibility**: Variable Writes [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility in [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) selection and [call option](../c/call_option.md) [volume](../v/volume.md) per share held.
3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Level**: Enhanced [risk](../r/risk.md) due to potential for [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [exercise](../e/exercise.md) points where stock ownership is called away.

## Conclusion

The Variable Ratio Write strategy is a sophisticated [options](../o/options.md) trading tactic [offering](../o/offering.md) benefits in [premium](../p/premium.md) collection and flexible [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). However, it significantly increases complexity and exposure to [risk](../r/risk.md). Investors must diligently analyze [market](../m/market.md) conditions, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and potential outcomes while monitoring positions consistently. Practical use can be enhanced by developing [robust](../r/robust.md) adjustment mechanisms suited to individual investment goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).
