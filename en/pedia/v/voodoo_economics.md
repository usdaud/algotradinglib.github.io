# Voodoo Economics

Voodoo [Economics](../e/economics.md) is a term that was popularized during the 1980 U.S. presidential campaign by George H.W. Bush, referring critically to the [supply](../s/supply.md)-side economic policies advocated by Ronald Reagan, who would eventually win the presidency. The term itself is pejorative and reflects skepticism or outright criticism of the theoretical and practical foundations of these policies.

## Definition
Voodoo [Economics](../e/economics.md) refers to economic policies that are perceived to be based on wishful thinking, unfounded optimism, or faith in extreme financial theories that lack empirical support. The term is primarily associated with the [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md) philosophy, which places a strong emphasis on tax cuts, [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md), and free-[market](../m/market.md) principles as means to stimulate [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Historical Context
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the global [economy](../e/economy.md) faced numerous challenges, including [stagflation](../s/stagflation.md) in the U.S., characterized by high [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates. Ronald Reagan's [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md), also called "[Reaganomics](../r/reaganomics.md)," was championed as a solution to these issues. The central idea was that reducing [taxes](../t/taxes.md) for individuals and businesses would stimulate investment, boost production, and ultimately lead to [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Key Principles of Supply-Side Economics
1. **Tax Cuts**: Lowering [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on [income](../i/income.md), [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, and businesses to incentivize investment and work.
2. **[Deregulation](../d/deregulation.md)**: Reducing government intervention in the [economy](../e/economy.md) to allow for more efficient functioning of free markets.
3. **[Monetary Policy](../m/monetary_policy.md)**: Focusing on controlling [inflation](../i/inflation.md) through [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), typically managed by a country's central [bank](../b/bank.md).
4. **[Free Trade](../f/free_trade.md)**: Promoting international [trade](../t/trade.md) by minimizing tariffs and [trade](../t/trade.md) barriers.

## Criticisms
Critics argue that [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md) disproportionately benefits the wealthy and leads to greater [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md). The term "Voodoo [Economics](../e/economics.md)" encapsulates this skepticism, highlighting several key criticisms:
1. **[Deficit](../d/deficit.md) Increase**: Tax cuts can lead to a significant increase in the national [deficit](../d/deficit.md) if they are not [offset](../o/offset.md) by corresponding cuts in government spending.
2. **[Wealth](../w/wealth.md) Inequality**: The benefits of tax cuts are often felt more by the wealthy, exacerbating [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md).
3. **Empirical Evidence**: Critics claim that there is little empirical evidence to substantiate the effectiveness of [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md) in achieving long-term [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).
4. **[Demand](../d/demand.md)-Side Ignorance**: [Supply](../s/supply.md)-side theory often neglects the importance of [aggregate demand](../a/aggregate_demand.md) in driving economic activity.

## Impact and Legacy
Despite these criticisms, [supply](../s/supply.md)-side [economics](../e/economics.md) has influenced economic policy decisions in the U.S. and other countries. The Reagan administration saw significant tax cuts, [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md) efforts, and changes to [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). The economic outcomes of these policies are still debated, with proponents pointing to the [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) during the 1980s as evidence of success and critics pointing to increasing national deficits and [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md) as failures.

### Case Study: Reagan Tax Cuts
In 1981, the [Economic Recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) Tax Act (ERTA) was passed, which significantly reduced [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax rates. The top [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) dropped from 70% to 50%, and [corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rates were also reduced. Proponents argue that these measures stimulated economic activity and led to a period of [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). Critics, however, claim that the tax cuts disproportionately benefited the wealthy and contributed to rising national [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Subsequent Administrations
Successive administrations have continued to debate and implement [supply](../s/supply.md)-side policies to varying degrees. For instance, the George W. Bush administration enacted tax cuts in the early 2000s, and the Trump administration's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act further reduced corporate and individual tax rates.

## Relevance in Modern Economics
Although the term "Voodoo [Economics](../e/economics.md)" is less commonly used today, the debates it represents remain highly relevant. Economists and policymakers continue to grapple with questions about the most effective ways to stimulate [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), manage national deficits, and address [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md).

## Conclusion
Voodoo [Economics](../e/economics.md) captures the skepticism surrounding [supply](../s/supply.md)-side economic theories and their practical applications. It serves as a reminder of the contentious nature of economic policymaking, where empirical evidence, theoretical perspectives, and political ideologies often collide. As economies continue to evolve, the debates ignited by the concept of Voodoo [Economics](../e/economics.md) are likely to remain a central part of discussions on economic policy and governance.
