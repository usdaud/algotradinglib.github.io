# Variable-Rate Demand Bond

Variable-Rate [Demand](../d/demand.md) Bonds (VRDBs), also known as Variable Rate [Demand](../d/demand.md) [Obligations](../o/obligation.md) (VRDOs), are a type of [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) with a [floating interest rate](../f/floating_interest_rate.md) that adjusts periodically. Unlike fixed-rate [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on VRDBs fluctuate based on changes in prevailing [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, which makes them an attractive investment for those seeking to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md). Here's a deep dive into various aspects of VRDBs:

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## Key Characteristics
### Interest Rate Adjustments
The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on VRDBs is typically reset at regular intervals—daily, weekly, or monthly—based on a specified [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) or [index](../i/index_instrument.md), such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the Securities [Industry](../i/industry.md) and [Financial Markets](../f/financial_market.md) Association (SIFMA) Municipal [Swap](../s/swap.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Demand Feature
One of the defining features of VRDBs is the "put" or "[demand](../d/demand.md)" option, which allows bondholders to sell the [bond](../b/bond.md) back to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) (or a designated [third party](../t/third_party.md)) at [par value](../p/par_value.md) plus [accrued interest](../a/accrued_interest.md) at specified times—often on each [interest](../i/interest.md) reset date. This [demand](../d/demand.md) feature provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and makes VRDBs similar to [short-term investments](../s/short-term_investments.md) from an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s perspective, even though they can have long-term maturities.

### Credit Enhancement
Many VRDBs come with [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancements, such as letters of [credit](../c/credit.md) (LOCs) or standby [bond](../b/bond.md) purchase agreements (SBPAs), which provide additional [assurance](../a/assurance.md) to bondholders that they [will](../w/will.md) receive their [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. These enhancements are often provided by highly rated banks or financial institutions.

## Issuance and Structure

### Issuers
VRDBs are predominantly issued by municipal entities such as states, cities, counties, and public authorities to [fund](../f/fund.md) various public projects including [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), schools, and utilities.

### Structure
VRDBs can be structured in different ways, including as single-[issue](../i/issue.md) bonds or as part of a larger [bond](../b/bond.md) series. The typical structure involves periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, with the [principal](../p/principal.md) repaid at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). Due to the [demand](../d/demand.md) feature, a [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) provider is usually involved to step in if a [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) decides to "put" the [bond](../b/bond.md) back.

### Remarketing Agents
A key player in the VRDB [market](../m/market.md) is the remarketing agent, who is responsible for resetting the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and reselling the bonds to new investors if current bondholders opt to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) their [demand](../d/demand.md) feature. The remarketing agent works to ensure that the bonds remain attractive to investors and can be resold at favorable rates.

## Advantages

### Flexibility
For investors, the main advantage of VRDBs is the combination of long-term investment with short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), thanks to the adjustable [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and the [demand](../d/demand.md) feature.

### Hedge Against Interest Rate Risk
The floating-rate nature of VRDBs makes them less susceptible to [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) compared to fixed-rate bonds. When [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments on VRDBs adjust upwards, helping to maintain the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [market value](../m/market_value.md).

### Favorable Tax Treatment
[Interest](../i/interest.md) earned on VRDBs is typically exempt from [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax and may also be exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md), depending on the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s location and the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s residency.

## Risks and Challenges

### Interest Rate Risk
While VRDBs are less exposed to [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) than fixed-rate bonds, they are not entirely immune. Rapid rate changes can lead to fluctuations in [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, which may not always align with investors' expectations.

### Liquidity Risk
Although the [demand](../d/demand.md) feature provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), there is still a [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the availability and reliability of the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) provider. If the entity providing the [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancement faces financial difficulties, the bondholders may be adversely affected.

### Credit Risk
The [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the issuing municipality and the [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancement provider can impact the overall [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of a VRDB. A downgrade in the [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) of either party can negatively affect the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s [market value](../m/market_value.md) and desirability.

### Remarketing Risk
The effectiveness of the remarketing agent plays a crucial role in the smooth functioning of VRDBs. If the remarketing agent is unable to successfully reset the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) or find new investors, it could lead to difficulties in selling the bonds when the [demand](../d/demand.md) feature is exercised.

## Use Cases and Applications

### Public Infrastructure Projects
Municipalities often utilize VRDBs to [finance](../f/finance.md) long-term public [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects. The flexible [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and the ability to "put" the bonds make them a preferred [financing](../f/financing.md) tool for projects that require substantial upfront [capital](../c/capital.md) investments.

### Cash Flow Management
VRDBs can be used by municipalities for effective [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) management, as the floating rate can help align [interest](../i/interest.md) payments with anticipated [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams, reducing fiscal strain during periods of economic fluctuation.

### Short-Term Investment Instruments
For investors, VRDBs serve as short-term investment instruments that [offer](../o/offer.md) greater returns than traditional [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds while providing the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) similar to short-term notes due to the [demand](../d/demand.md) feature.

## Market Trends and Developments

### Evolution of Benchmark Rates
With the gradual phase-out of LIBOR, the VRDB [market](../m/market.md) has been transitioning toward alternative benchmarks like the Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate (SOFR). This transition aims to ensure a more stable and reliable [basis](../b/basis.md) for [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) adjustments.

### Digital Transformation and FinTech
The adoption of digital platforms and fintech solutions is changing the landscape of how [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), including VRDBs, are issued and traded. Platforms that facilitate electronic trading, such as those provided by companies like BondCliQ ( [offer](../o/offer.md) enhanced [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in the [market](../m/market.md).

### Increased Focus on Sustainability
As environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations [gain](../g/gain.md) prominence, municipalities are increasingly issuing VRDBs to [fund](../f/fund.md) sustainable and socially responsible projects. This [trend](../t/trend.md) aligns with the growing [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) for investments that contribute to positive societal impacts.

## Conclusion

Variable-Rate [Demand](../d/demand.md) Bonds present a unique blend of flexibility, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and potential tax advantages, making them valuable tools for both investors and municipal issuers. The adjustable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates help protect against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), while the [demand](../d/demand.md) feature ensures that investors can access their funds as needed. However, VRDBs come with their own set of risks, including [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md), [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), and remarketing [risk](../r/risk.md), which must be carefully considered.

As the financial landscape continues to evolve, particularly with advancements in fintech and shifts towards sustainable investments, the [market](../m/market.md) for VRDBs is likely to undergo significant changes. Continued innovation and adaptation [will](../w/will.md) be essential for maintaining the relevance and attractiveness of VRDBs in the future financial ecosystem.
