# Value Chain

The concept of the [value](../v/value.md) chain was introduced by Michael Porter in his 1985 book "[Competitive Advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md): Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance." The [value](../v/value.md) chain is a strategic analysis tool used to identify the [business activities](../b/business_activities.md) that create [value](../v/value.md) for a company. It splits overall [business activities](../b/business_activities.md) into primary and support activities, revealing the areas where businesses can achieve cost advantages or differentiate their products.
