# Last Sale Price

The last sale price is the price of the most recent completed trade in a security. It is a real time reference for the current market level.

## Why it matters
- Used for charts and price displays.
- Impacts mark to market valuations.
- Influences alerts and trading signals.

## Example
If the last sale price for a stock is 42.15, that is the most recent executed price, even if the current bid and ask are different.

## Practical notes
The last sale may not represent the mid price or fair value in fast markets. It is one data point among bid, ask, and depth.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Last Sale Price and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.

- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Last Sale Price as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Last Sale Price, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
