# Leveraged Mutual Funds

Leveraged mutual funds are a type of [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md) that aims to deliver multiples of the performance of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) or [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) they track. They are designed to provide enhanced returns by using financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) to amplify the daily gains or losses of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md). Unlike traditional mutual funds that aim for moderate and steady growth over a long period, leveraged mutual funds seek to magnify the short-term movements of [index](../i/index_instrument.md) prices, making them suitable for traders and investors with a higher [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and a short-term [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md).

### How Leveraged Mutual Funds Work

Leveraged mutual funds typically employ sophisticated financial instruments such as [options](../o/options.md), [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), and swaps to achieve their objectives. These instruments allow the funds to [gain](../g/gain.md) more exposure to an [index](../i/index_instrument.md) than would be possible by merely [investing](../i/investing.md) in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities alone. Let's consider a leveraged [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) that aims to deliver twice (2x) the daily performance of the S&P 500 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md). If the S&P 500 rises by 1% in a day, the leveraged [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) would aim to rise by approximately 2%. Conversely, if the S&P 500 falls by 1%, the leveraged [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) would aim to fall by approximately 2%.

#### Key Characteristics:
1. **[Leverage Ratios](../l/leverage_ratios.md)**: Leveraged mutual funds are often designed with specific [leverage ratios](../l/leverage_ratios.md) such as 2x or 3x, indicating the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s goal to achieve two or three times the daily performance of the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) respectively.
2. **Daily [Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md)**: These funds typically rebalance their portfolios daily to maintain a consistent [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md). This [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) process involves adjusting the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [holdings](../h/holdings.md) to ensure that the exposure to the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) adheres to the specified [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md).
3. **Compound Effect**: The daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) and the fact that returns are compounded magnify the differences between the leveraged [fund](../f/fund.md)'s performance and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) over longer periods. This can result in significant deviations from the expected [multiple](../m/multiple.md) over time due to daily fluctuations in [value](../v/value.md).
4. **Higher Costs**: Leveraged mutual funds often come with higher [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios compared to traditional mutual funds due to the complexities and costs associated with actively managing [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) the [fund](../f/fund.md) daily.

### Use Cases for Leveraged Mutual Funds

Leveraged mutual funds are geared toward investors who are looking for short-term gains and have the [risk](../r/risk.md) appetite to [handle](../h/handle.md) the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) that comes with leveraged products. These funds can be used for several purposes:

1. **[Speculation](../s/speculation.md)**: Traders may use leveraged mutual funds to speculate on short-term [market](../m/market.md) movements. Given the tools that magnify both gains and losses, leveraged mutual funds can [offer](../o/offer.md) significant short-term [profit](../p/profit.md) potential for those who correctly predict [market](../m/market.md) direction.
2. **Hedging**: These funds can also be used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) other investments in an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s portfolio. For instance, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) has a sizable position in an S&P 500 [index fund](../i/index_fund.md), they could use a leveraged inverse [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against a short-term [market](../m/market.md) downturn.
3. **Tactical Allocation**: Some investors use leveraged mutual funds to make short-term tactical adjustments in their portfolios. By allocating a portion of their portfolio to these funds, they can [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on expected short-term [market](../m/market.md) moves without having to buy and sell individual securities.

### Risks of Leveraged Mutual Funds

While leveraged mutual funds [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for enhanced returns, they come with significant risks that investors must carefully consider:

1. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [Risk](../r/risk.md) of Loss**: The magnified movements make these funds highly volatile. Small declines in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) can lead to substantial losses in a leveraged [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md), potentially more than investors bargained for.
2. **Decay**: The daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) and [compounding](../c/compounding.md) effect can lead to a performance decay over time, meaning that the [fund](../f/fund.md) might not achieve its stated [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) over longer periods. This is especially true in choppy or sideways markets, where the daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) tends to diminish returns.
3. **Higher Costs**: With the added complexity of managing [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), there are typically higher management fees and operational costs associated with leveraged mutual funds. These costs can eat into overall performance.
4. **Suitability**: Leveraged mutual funds are generally not suitable for long-term investors due to the daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) and [compounding](../c/compounding.md) effects. They are better suited for experienced investors who understand the risks involved and can monitor their investments frequently.

### Examples of Leveraged Mutual Funds

Several companies [offer](../o/offer.md) leveraged mutual funds aimed at different indexes and sectors. Here are a few prominent examples:

1. **ProShares**: ProShares is one of the largest providers of [leveraged ETFs](../l/leveraged_etfs.md) and mutual funds. They [offer](../o/offer.md) a variety of leveraged products that track indices such as the S&P 500, [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md), and Russell 2000.
 - ProShares
2. **Direxion**: Direxion also provides a wide array of leveraged mutual funds aimed at various sectors and commodities. They [offer](../o/offer.md) both leveraged [bull](../b/bull.md) (long) and bear (short) funds.
 - Direxion
3. **Rydex Funds**: Rydex, part of Guggenheim Investments, offers mutual funds with various [leverage ratios](../l/leverage_ratios.md), targeting different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and strategies.
 - Guggenheim Investments
4. **Fidelity Leveraged [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Funds**: Fidelity also offers a selection of leveraged [index](../i/index_instrument.md) funds for more advanced traders.
 - Fidelity

### Regulatory Environment

The use of [leverage](../l/leverage.md) in mutual funds is highly regulated due to the risks involved. In the United States, the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) imposes strict guidelines on the amount of [leverage](../l/leverage.md) mutual funds can employ. Funds must also be transparent about their strategies and risks, providing detailed disclosures to investors.

### Conclusion

Leveraged mutual funds [offer](../o/offer.md) an innovative approach for investors seeking to amplify short-term [market](../m/market.md) movements. However, they are complex instruments that come with a heightened level of [risk](../r/risk.md). These funds are not intended for the average [investor](../i/investor.md) who is saving for retirement or other long-term goals but are instead best suited for those with a deep understanding of the markets and a high tolerance for [risk](../r/risk.md). As with any investment, it's crucial to conduct thorough research and, if necessary, consult with a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) to determine if leveraged mutual funds align with your [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) profile.
