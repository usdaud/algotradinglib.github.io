# Ladder Order

A ladder order is a set of multiple orders placed at different price levels. The ladder spreads entries or exits across a range to reduce timing risk and improve average execution.

## How it works
- A trader chooses a price range.
- Orders are placed at regular intervals within that range.
- As price moves, some orders fill while others remain pending.

## Use cases
- Scaling into a position during a pullback.
- Scaling out as price approaches a target.
- Building a position in illiquid markets without moving price.

## Example
A trader wants to buy 1,000 shares between 48 and 50. They place five limit orders for 200 shares each at 48, 48.50, 49, 49.50, and 50.

## Risks
A ladder can leave partial fills and uneven exposure. If price reverses sharply, the trader may be under or over allocated.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Ladder Order and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Ladder Order as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Ladder Order, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Ladder Order. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Ladder Order alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
