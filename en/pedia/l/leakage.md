# Leakage

Leakage, also known as data leakage, refers to an occurrence in statistical modeling where information from outside the training dataset is inadvertently used to create the model. This can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates during model evaluation and ultimately to the deployment of models that do not generalize well to unseen data. Leakage can take many forms and is especially problematic in the field of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algotrading), where even minute distortions can lead to significant financial consequences.

### Types of Leakage

Leakage can manifest in several different forms in a [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) or statistical modeling context. The most common types of leakage are:

1. **Target Leakage**: Occurs when information that [will](../w/will.md) not be available at prediction time is used during the training process.
2. **Train-Test Bleed**: Happens when information leaks from the test set into the training set, resulting in an over-optimistic evaluation metric.
3. **Feature Leakage**: When features derived from the target variable or future data (data not available at the time of the event being predicted) are included in the model.

### Causes of Leakage in Algotrading

#### 1. **Incorrect Cross-Validation**
   - Using time-series data without maintaining the chronological [order](../o/order.md) can result in future information leaking into past data. 
   - Example: Randomly shuffling time-series data before splitting into cross-validation folds.

#### 2. **Improper Feature Engineering**
   - Including features that give away future information, such as future returns or post-event [statistics](../s/statistics.md).
   - Example: Using the average closing price for the next five days as an input feature.

#### 3. **Data Preprocessing Mistakes**
   - Normalizing data using the entire dataset [statistics](../s/statistics.md) instead of the training set [statistics](../s/statistics.md).
   - Example: Scaling features using the mean and variance of the entire dataset, including the test set.

### Consequences of Leakage

Leakage can severely impact the performance and reliability of an algotrading model. Some of the key consequences include:

#### 1. **Overfitting**
   - The model may perform exceptionally well on training data but [fail](../f/fail.md) to generalize to unseen data.
   - Example: A model predicts stock prices accurately on past data but performs poorly in live trading.

#### 2. **Misleading Performance Metrics**
   - Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) can be significantly inflated, leading to false confidence in the model.
   - Example: A backtested [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) shows high returns due to leakage but incurs losses in real trading.

#### 3. **Financial Loss**
   - Deploying a model impacted by leakage can result in substantial financial losses due to poor trading decisions.
   - Example: A [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) loses millions by trading on a faulty model that appeared profitable in backtests.

### Detecting Leakage

Detecting leakage is essential for creating [robust](../r/robust.md) algotrading models. Here are some strategies to identify potential leakage:

#### 1. **Feature Audit**
   - Examine each feature to ensure it does not contain future information or is not derived from the target variable.
   - Example: Ensuring rolling averages are calculated within the training window only.

#### 2. **Proper Dataset Splitting**
   - Maintain a strict temporal [order](../o/order.md) when splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Example: Using walk-forward validation or [time series](../t/time_series.md) split.

#### 3. **Evaluate Realistically**
   - Use metrics that are unaffected by potential leakage and are indicative of real-world performance, such as [out-of-sample testing](../o/out-of-sample_testing.md).
   - Example: [Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) on a set of data not touched during training and hyperparameter tuning.

### Mitigating Leakage

To mitigate leakage, follow these [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) during model development:

#### 1. **Ensure Temporal Integrity**
   - Always respect the chronological [order](../o/order.md) of data in [time series](../t/time_series.md) problems.
   - Example: When predicting stock prices, never use future data to inform past predictions.

#### 2. **Segregate Data Properly**
   - Split data into training and test sets in a way that prevents future data from contaminating the training process.
   - Example: Employing a time-based split where the training set includes data up to a certain date and the test set includes data after that date.

#### 3. **Feature Engineering Discipline**
   - Create features that are based solely on available data at the time of the prediction.
   - Example: Using [lagged variables](../l/lagged_variables_in_trading.md) or rolling window [statistics](../s/statistics.md) that do not peek into future data.

[Zomma](../z/zomma.md) LLC is a quant trading [firm](../f/firm.md) (https://[zomma](../z/zomma.md).ai/) specializing in high-frequency [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). The [firm](../f/firm.md) emphasizes rigorous [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and validation frameworks to avoid data leakage. 

By implementing walk-forward validation techniques and keeping a strict separation of training and evaluation datasets, [Zomma](../z/zomma.md) ensures that their models generalize well in live trading environments. They also engage in continuous monitoring and iterative refinements to capture any potential signs of leakage post-deployment.

#### Case Study: QuantConnect

[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) (https://www.[quantconnect](../q/quantconnect.md).com/) is a research platform for developing [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md). [QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) provides tools such as Lean Algorithm Framework, which includes built-in mechanisms to prevent data leakage. Their [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) framework automatically manages historical data in a way that prevents future information from leaking into past data, thus ensuring more reliable [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).

Through examples from [QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md), itâ€™s evident that utilizing platforms with strong, built-in mechanisms to prevent leakage can help individual traders and organizations develop more [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading models](../t/trading_models.md).

### Conclusion

Leakage is a critical [issue](../i/issue.md) in the field of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) that can lead to misleading model performance and substantial financial losses. Identifying and mitigating leakage involves strict data handling practices, thorough feature audits, and using appropriate datasets.
