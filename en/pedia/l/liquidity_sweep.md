# Liquidity Sweep

A liquidity sweep is a large order that executes across multiple price levels, removing resting liquidity from the order book. It often occurs when a trader needs immediate execution.

## How it appears
- Multiple prints at increasing prices for a buy sweep.
- Rapid consumption of visible order book levels.
- Short term price impact and wider spreads.

## Example
A buy sweep executes through five price levels in seconds, pushing the price up. The move signals aggressive demand and can trigger momentum trading.

## Risks
Sweeps can cause slippage and can reveal urgency to the market. Traders using sweeps should consider the impact on execution costs.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Liquidity Sweep and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Liquidity Sweep as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Liquidity Sweep, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Liquidity Sweep. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Liquidity Sweep alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
