# Leading Market Indicator

A leading market indicator is a data series that tends to change before the broader market or economy. It helps anticipate turning points rather than confirm them after the fact.

## Examples
- Yield curve spreads.
- New orders and manufacturing surveys.
- Building permits and housing starts.
- Equity market breadth measures.

## How it is used
Investors use leading indicators to adjust risk exposure or to confirm macro themes. No single indicator is sufficient, so multiple signals are typically combined.

## Example
A steepening yield curve and rising new orders suggest improving growth conditions, which may support equity risk taking.

## Limitations
Leading indicators can give false signals and are often revised. They should be used with risk management rather than as a timing tool.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Leading Market Indicator and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Leading Market Indicator as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Leading Market Indicator, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Leading Market Indicator. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Leading Market Indicator alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
