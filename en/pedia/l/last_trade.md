# Last Trade

The last trade is the most recent executed transaction for a security. It includes the price, size, and timestamp of the latest execution.

## Uses
- Real time price tracking.
- Triggering stop or limit orders.
- Market data feeds and charting.

## Example
A trade prints at 101.25 for 500 shares at 10:30:05. That trade becomes the last trade until another transaction occurs.

## Caution
In thin markets the last trade can be stale. Traders should consider the bid and ask when evaluating current price.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Last Trade and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Last Trade as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Last Trade, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Last Trade. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Last Trade alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
