# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997, and have since been refined and popularized, especially in applications where sequential data is prevalent. LSTMs are particularly effective for [time series](../t/time_series.md) prediction, [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP), [speech recognition](../s/speech_recognition.md), and many other tasks involving sequential data. This detailed exploration provides an in-depth analysis of LSTM [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md), covering their architecture, functionality, variations, applications, and more.

### Architecture of LSTMs

The LSTM architecture is designed specifically to avoid the long-term dependency problem faced by traditional RNNs. LSTMs introduce a unique structure known as memory cells, which are responsible for maintaining the cell state over time. Each memory cell consists of several key components:

1. **Cell State ($C_t$)**: It is the main component that carries information across the network over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) timesteps. The cell state can be adjusted by various gates to retain or discard information.

2. **Hidden State ($h_t$)**: It serves as a means to provide an output at each timestep and is also passed to the next timestep.

3. **Input Gate ($i_t$)**: Controls what proportion of the input flows into the cell state, facilitating the updating of the cell state with new information.

4. **Forget Gate ($f_t$)**: Decides what part of the information in the cell state should be discarded. This helps in removing irrelevant information from the past.

5. **Output Gate ($o_t$)**: Determines the output based on the cell state and decides what part of the cell state flows to the hidden state.

The gates are typically activated using sigmoid functions, whereas the cell state updates often involve tanh functions. A detailed step-by-step process of LSTM calculations at each timestep is presented below.

### LSTM Functionality

The LSTM functionality can be broken down as follows for a given timestep $t$:

1. **Forget Gate Activation**:
   \[
   f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
   \]
   > The forget gate decides what information to discard from the cell state ($C_{t-1}$). Here, $W_f$ is the weight matrix, $h_{t-1}$ is the previous hidden state, $x_t$ is the current input, and $b_f$ is the bias vector.

2. **Input Gate Activation and Candidate Cell State**:
   \[
   i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
   \]
   > The input gate determines what new information to store in the cell state.

   \[
   \tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
   \]
   > The candidate cell state $\tilde{C}_t$ is formed using the tanh function.

3. **Cell State Update**:
   \[
   C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t
   \]
   > The cell state $C_t$ undergoes updates based on the forget gate and input gate activations.

4. **Output Gate Activation and Hidden State Update**:
   \[
   o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
   \]
   > The output gate decides the output from the current cell state.

   \[
   h_t = o_t * \tanh(C_t)
   \]
   > The hidden state $h_t$ is updated and forms the output for the current timestep.

This series of operations ensures that relevant information can be retained over long sequences, addressing the problem of vanishing gradients found in traditional RNNs.

### Variations of LSTM Networks

Several variations and enhancements to the standard LSTM architecture have been proposed to improve performance and [specialization](../s/specialization.md) for different tasks:

1. **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**: This variation includes two LSTMs, one processing the input sequence from start to end and another from end to start. This approach is beneficial for contexts where future states can improve prediction accuracy.

2. **Multilayer LSTM**: Stacks [multiple](../m/multiple.md) LSTM layers to increase the network's capacity to learn complex patterns from the data.

3. **Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM)**: Integrates convolutional layers with LSTM units, making them suitable for spatial-temporal data like videos.

4. **Peephole LSTM**: Adds connections from the cell state to the gates, allowing the gates to access the cell state information directly.

5. **Coupled Forget and Input Gate (CIFG)**: Simplifies LSTM by coupling the forget and input gates, reducing the computational overhead.
