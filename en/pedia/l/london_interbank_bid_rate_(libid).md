# London Interbank Bid Rate (LIBID)

The London Interbank [Bid](../b/bid.md) Rate (LIBID) is a significant yet often less-discussed financial metric within the [money](../m/money.md) markets and banking sectors. While it is not as well-known as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), it plays an essential role in interbank lending and borrowing activities.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## What is LIBID?

The LIBID is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which banks are willing to borrow funds from other banks in the London [interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md). Essentially, it represents the [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) for short-term loans between banks. This rate is crucial for financial institutions as it helps them manage their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and short-term funding requirements.

Unlike LIBOR, which is the rate at which banks lend to each other, LIBID is the rate at which they are prepared to borrow. The differential between these two rates is generally small but noteworthy, often termed the "[bid](../b/bid.md)-[offer](../o/offer.md) spread."

## How is LIBID Calculated?

LIBID is determined based on the prices quoted by a panel of contributing banks. These banks submit the rates at which they are willing to borrow funds in various currencies and for different periods. The rate is calculated by taking the average of these submitted rates, excluding the highest and lowest values to eliminate outliers.

Historically, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) managed the calculation and publication of LIBID, but this role has since transitioned to the Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE). However, it is essential to [note](../n/note.md) that LIBID is not as rigorously standardized as LIBOR, and it does not have the same level of formal publication or regulatory oversight.

## Importance of LIBID

### Liquidity Management

Banks and financial institutions rely on LIBID as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) to gauge the cost of borrowing in the [interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md). This rate helps them manage their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by determining whether it is more cost-effective to borrow from the [market](../m/market.md) or to [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) some assets.

### Pricing of Financial Instruments

LIBID serves as a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) for various financial instruments, including [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), [forward rate](../f/forward_rate.md) agreements, and [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md). These instruments often use a spread over LIBID to determine their pricing, making it a critical component in [structured finance](../s/structured_finance.md) and [derivative](../d/derivative.md) markets.

### Economic Indicator

LIBID can act as an [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md), providing insights into the banking sector's health and confidence levels. A widening spread between LIBOR and LIBID might indicate increased [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), higher [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), or reduced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md).

## Comparison with LIBOR

While both LIBID and LIBOR are interbank rates, they serve opposite functions. LIBOR is the rate at which banks lend to each other, whereas LIBID is the rate at which they borrow. Generally, LIBID is slightly lower than LIBOR due to the [bid](../b/bid.md)-[offer](../o/offer.md) spread, which compensates for the [risk](../r/risk.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) preference of lending banks.

In recent years, the financial [industry](../i/industry.md) has scrutinized LIBOR due to concerns over its accuracy and susceptibility to manipulation. This scrutiny has led to the development of alternative reference rates such as the Sterling Overnight [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Average (SONIA) and the Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate (SOFR). However, these changes have also affected the perception and utilization of LIBID.

## Historical Context

The concept of LIBID emerged alongside LIBOR in the mid-1980s as banks sought standardized benchmarks for interbank lending and borrowing. Initially managed by the BBA, the rates provided a transparent and reliable [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of short-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates in the London [interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md).

Despite its importance, LIBID has not received the same level of attention or formal regulation as LIBOR. This lack of standardized oversight has resulted in a less consistent application of LIBID across the banking sector, with banks often using proprietary methods to determine their borrowing rates.

## Modern Relevance

In today's financial landscape, LIBID continues to play a vital role, although it operates more in the background compared to more prominent rates like LIBOR or SOFR. Financial institutions still rely on LIBID for [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) management and as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for certain financial products.

With the ongoing transition away from LIBOR, there is potential for renewed focus on LIBID and other interbank borrowing rates. As markets adapt to new reference rates, the methodology and application of LIBID may evolve, [offering](../o/offering.md) opportunities for increased [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and standardization.

## Conclusion

The London Interbank [Bid](../b/bid.md) Rate (LIBID) is an essential component of the interbank lending [market](../m/market.md), representing the rate at which banks are willing to borrow from each other. While it may not receive the same level of attention as LIBOR, its role in [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) management, [financial instrument pricing](../f/financial_instrument_pricing.md), and as an [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) underscores its importance.

Understanding LIBID and its interplay with other interbank rates is crucial for financial professionals, particularly in an evolving landscape where traditional benchmarks are being replaced. As the financial [industry](../i/industry.md) continues to adapt, the relevance and application of LIBID may expand, [offering](../o/offering.md) new opportunities for [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and standardization in the [interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md).
