# Loss Limit

A loss limit is a predefined maximum loss allowed for a trade, day, or period. It is a key risk management tool used to prevent small losses from turning into large drawdowns.

## Types
- Per trade loss limit based on stop loss.
- Daily loss limit that stops trading for the day.
- Portfolio loss limit that triggers risk reduction.

## Example
A trader sets a daily loss limit of 1 percent of equity. If losses reach that level, trading stops and positions are reduced.

## Practical notes
Loss limits should account for volatility and trading style. Rules are only effective if followed consistently.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Loss Limit and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Loss Limit as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Loss Limit, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Loss Limit. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Loss Limit alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
