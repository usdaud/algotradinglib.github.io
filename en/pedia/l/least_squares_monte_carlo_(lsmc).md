# Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC)

Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) is a [simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md)-based method for estimating the [value](../v/value.md) of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), particularly American-style [options](../o/options.md), which provide the holder with the right to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) at [multiple](../m/multiple.md) points before the expiry. This technique blends elements of [Monte Carlo simulation](../m/monte_carlo_simulation.md) and [least squares regression](../l/least_squares_regression.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a powerful tool for handling complex [derivative](../d/derivative.md) pricing where analytical solutions are often infeasible.

### Background and Context
The [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of American [options](../o/options.md) signifies a notable complexity due to the embedded feature of [early exercise](../e/early_exercise.md). Traditional methods like the Black-Scholes formulacmanage [European options](../e/european_options.md) but fall short for American counterparts. Least Squares Monte Carlo addresses this gap effectively by providing a numerical method to estimate the optimal [exercise](../e/exercise.md) strategy and the corresponding option [value](../v/value.md).

The method was first introduced by Francis Longstaff and Eduardo Schwartz in their seminal paper "Valuing American [Options](../o/options.md) by [Simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md): A Simple Least-Squares Approach" in 2001. This pioneering work laid the foundation for LSMC and demonstrated its efficacy in pricing high-dimensional American [options](../o/options.md).

### Core Concepts

1. **[Monte Carlo Simulation](../m/monte_carlo_simulation.md)**: [Monte Carlo methods](../m/monte_carlo_methods.md) are [computational algorithms](../c/computational_algorithms.md) that use repeated random [sampling](../s/sampling.md) to obtain numerical results. Primarily, they are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that is not easily predictable due to the intervention of [random variables](../r/random_variables.md). [Monte Carlo simulation](../m/monte_carlo_simulation.md) for option pricing involves simulating the paths of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price.

2. **[Least Squares Regression](../l/least_squares_regression.md)**: [Least Squares Regression](../l/least_squares_regression.md) is a statistical method used to determine the [line of best fit](../l/line_of_best_fit.md) by minimizing the [sum of squares](../s/sum_of_squares.md) of the residuals (the differences between observed and estimated values). In the context of LSMC, regression aids in estimating the conditional expectation of continuation values.

### Detailed Process of LSMC

1. **Simulate [Asset](../a/asset.md) Prices**: Generate a large number of possible paths of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) price using Monte Carlo simulations. For each path, compute the price of the [asset](../a/asset.md) at each time step until the optionâ€™s [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

2. **Backward Induction**: Start from the final time step ([maturity](../m/maturity.md)) and move backward. At [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the payoff of the option is known. For preceding time steps, the optimal decision ([exercise](../e/exercise.md) or continue) needs to be determined.

3. **Regression to Estimate Conditional Expectation**: For each simulated path at each time step, use [least squares regression](../l/least_squares_regression.md) to estimate the conditional expectation of the option's continuation [value](../v/value.md) based on the current state of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). The regression typically uses a [basis](../b/basis.md) set of functions of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) price (e.g., polynomials).

4. **Determine [Exercise](../e/exercise.md) Strategy**: Compare the immediate [exercise](../e/exercise.md) [value](../v/value.md) to the continuation [value](../v/value.md) (estimated using regression). Opt for [exercise](../e/exercise.md) if the immediate [exercise](../e/exercise.md) [value](../v/value.md) exceeds the conditional expectation of the continuation [value](../v/value.md).

5. **Average Optimal Payoffs**: Once the optimal [exercise](../e/exercise.md) strategy is established, average the discounted payoffs of the simulated paths to determine the approximate [value](../v/value.md) of the [American option](../a/american_option.md).

### Advantages of LSMC

- **Flexibility**: LSMC can [handle](../h/handle.md) various [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) dynamics and payoffs which are difficult to address using closed-form solutions.
- **High-Dimensional Problems**: It is particularly effective in dealing with multi-dimensional problems, such as basket [options](../o/options.md) or scenarios with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) state variables.
- **[Dynamic Hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md) Insights**: The method provides useful insights for [dynamic hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md) strategies by revealing the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) boundary and continuation values.

### Challenges and Mitigations
While LSMC is versatile and powerful, it does carry certain complexities and computational requirements:

1. **Computational Intensity**: LSMC can be computationally demanding as it involves a large number of Monte Carlo simulations and regression at each time step. Efficient implementation and parallel processing can help mitigate this.

2. **Regression Specifications**: The choice of regression [basis](../b/basis.md) functions significantly impacts the accuracy of the method. Polynomial approximations are common, but the selection should consider the problem's specific characteristics to avoid [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md) or underfitting.

3. **Path Dependencies**: For [path-dependent options](../p/path-dependent_options.md) (like Asian [options](../o/options.md)), adjustments in the simulated paths and regression procedures are necessary.

### Practical Applications
LSMC has wide applications in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), particularly in sectors dealing with [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

1. **[Equity Options](../e/equity_options.md)**: Pricing of American-style stock [options](../o/options.md) where [early exercise](../e/early_exercise.md) possibilities significantly influence the option's [value](../v/value.md).
2. **Fixed-[Income](../i/income.md) Securities**: [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) of callable bonds, where issuers have the right to redeem the bonds before [maturity](../m/maturity.md).
3. **Energy Markets**: Valuing swing [options](../o/options.md) in energy markets which allow holders to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times.
4. **Real [Options](../o/options.md)**: Assessing investment projects with embedded managerial flexibilities such as [options](../o/options.md) to expand, delay, or abandon.

### Case Study: Implementing LSMC

Consider the task of pricing an American [put option](../p/put.md). The steps would include:

1. **Simulating [Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) Paths**:
   ```python
   [import](../i/import.md) numpy as np
   
   def simulate_asset_paths(S0, r, sigma, T, M, I):
       """ Generate [asset](../a/asset.md) paths using [geometric Brownian motion](../g/geometric_brownian_motion.md). """
       dt = T / M
       paths = np.zeros((M + 1, I))
       paths[0] = S0
       for t in [range](../r/range.md)(1, M + 1):
           z = np.random.standard_normal(I)
           paths[t] = paths[t - 1] * np.exp((r - 0.5 * sigma**2) * dt + sigma * np.sqrt(dt) * z)
       [return](../r/return.md) paths
   
   # Parameters
   S0 = 100  # initial stock price
   r = 0.05  # [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
   sigma = 0.2  # [volatility](../v/volatility.md)
   T = 1.0  # time-to-[maturity](../m/maturity.md) in years
   M = 50  # number of time steps
   I = 10000  # number of simulated paths
   
   np.random.seed(0)
   paths = simulate_asset_paths(S0, r, sigma, T, M, I)
   ```
2. **Calculating Payoffs at [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**:
   ```python
   K = 100  # [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)
   P = np.maximum(K - paths[-1], 0)
   ```
3. **Backward Induction and Regression**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model [import](../i/import.md) LinearRegression
   
   h = np.maximum(K - paths, 0)
   cash_flows = np.zeros((M + 1, I))
   cash_flows[-1] = h[-1]
   
   for t in [range](../r/range.md)(M - 1, 0, -1):
       rg = np.polyfit(paths[t], cash_flows[t + 1] * np.exp(-r * (T / M)), 5)
       C = np.polyval(rg, paths[t])
       [exercise](../e/exercise.md) = h[t] > C
       cash_flows[t] = np.where([exercise](../e/exercise.md), h[t], cash_flows[t + 1] * np.exp(-r * (T / M)))
   
   option_value = np.mean(cash_flows[1] * np.exp(-r * (T / M)))
   print(f"Estimated American [Put Option](../p/put.md) [Value](../v/value.md): {option_value:.2f}")
   ```
This example provides a simplified illustration of LSMC applied to an American [put option](../p/put.md), demonstrating the blending of [simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md) and regression to derive an estimated option [value](../v/value.md).
