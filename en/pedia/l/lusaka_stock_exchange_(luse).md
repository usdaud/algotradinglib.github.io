# Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE)

The Lusaka Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LuSE) is the primary stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of Zambia, located in the [capital](../c/capital.md) city, Lusaka. It was established in 1993 to provide a marketplace for trading securities and facilitate [capital](../c/capital.md) raising in Zambia. The LuSE plays a fundamental role in the economic development of the country by mobilizing [capital](../c/capital.md) for businesses and [offering](../o/offering.md) investment opportunities to both local and international investors.

## History and Development

The Lusaka Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was inaugurated on February 21, 1994, as a collaborative effort between the Zambian government, the [International Finance Corporation](../i/international_finance_corporation.md) (IFC), and the Stockholm Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md).
