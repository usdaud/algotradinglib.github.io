# Latency Arbitrage

Latency arbitrage exploits differences in information arrival and order processing speed across venues. The strategy seeks to trade on a slower venue before its prices update to reflect a move on a faster venue.

## How It Works
A latency arbitrage system monitors fast data feeds and identifies price changes. It then sends orders to slower venues where quotes have not yet adjusted. Profit comes from capturing the stale price before the market aligns.

## Requirements
The strategy requires very low latency data feeds, optimized networks, and often co-location. It also demands precise time synchronization and fast order handling.

## Risks
Competition is intense, and small delays can erase the edge. Regulatory and venue rule changes can reduce or eliminate the opportunity. High fixed infrastructure costs make the strategy unsuitable for smaller operations.

## Conclusion
Latency arbitrage is a specialized approach that depends on speed and infrastructure. It can be profitable but is difficult to sustain.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Latency Arbitrage and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Latency Arbitrage as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Latency Arbitrage, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Latency Arbitrage. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Latency Arbitrage alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
