# Level 2 Assets

Level 2 assets are one of the categories used in financial reporting under the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) hierarchy of [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820 and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 13. These assets are not as easily valued as [Level 1 assets](../l/level_1_assets.md), which are typically traded in active markets and have readily available price data. Instead, Level 2 assets require some price modelling due to the less frequent trading or more complex [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Characteristics of Level 2 Assets

Level 2 assets [hold](../h/hold.md) several distinguishing features:

1. **Observable Inputs**: Unlike [Level 1 assets](../l/level_1_assets.md), Level 2 assets utilize observable inputs other than quoted prices that are readily available for identical assets. Such observable inputs could include quoted prices for similar assets in active or non-active markets.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Activity**: These assets are not traded in high volumes or frequency, making their [valuation](../v/valuation.md) less transparent compared to [Level 1 assets](../l/level_1_assets.md).
3. **Reliance on Models**: [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) relies on models incorporating observable [market](../m/market.md) data. For instance, the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) might be derived using the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of expected future cash flows, with inputs based on observable [market](../m/market.md) data, such as [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [yield](../y/yield.md) curves.

## Examples of Level 2 Assets

Examples of Level 2 assets include:

1. **Corporate Bonds**: These bonds may not [trade](../t/trade.md) daily but have observable data points such as [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [credit](../c/credit.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) that can be used in [valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md).
2. **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed Securities (MBS)**: Although these securities do not [trade](../t/trade.md) as frequently as more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets, they do have observable inputs like yields and [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) rates that help in [valuation](../v/valuation.md).
3. **[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md)**: Certain [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), like [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md), fall under Level 2 as their fair values can be determined using models with observable inputs such as [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) curves.
4. **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Positions in Private Companies**: Valuations can be based on [market](../m/market.md) multiples of similar [listed](../l/listed.md) companies, adjusted for the differences between the observed inputs and the positions held.

## Valuation Methods for Level 2 Assets

Valuing Level 2 assets necessitates several methods that incorporate observable [market](../m/market.md) data:

1. **[Market Approach](../m/market_approach.md)**: This involves using [market](../m/market.md) transactions for similar or comparable assets.
2. **[Income Approach](../i/income_approach.md)**: This uses models like discounted cash flows (DCF), which project future cash flows and [discount](../d/discount.md) them to [present value](../p/present_value.md) using observable rates.
3. **Cost Approach**: This might be less relevant for Level 2 financial assets but might involve valuing the [asset](../a/asset.md) based on the cost of replacement or reproduction.

For example, a [corporate bond](../c/corporate_bond.md) might be valued using a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [yield curve](../y/yard.md) and an adjustment for the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s [credit spread](../c/credit_spread.md), both observable in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Importance in Financial Reporting

Financial reporting relies heavily on the categorization of assets within the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) hierarchy to give a clear picture of a [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). Level 2 assets, while less transparent than Level 1, provide crucial balance between observable inputs and inherent uncertainties that [Level 3 assets](../l/level_3_assets.md) lack. Firms are required to disclose not only the valuations but also the methodologies and inputs used for Level 2 assets, ensuring a transparent overview of their [asset valuation](../a/asset_valuation.md) processes.

## Regulatory Framework

The [valuation](../v/valuation.md) and reporting of Level 2 assets are governed by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards and regulatory requirements:

1. **FASB ASC 820**: This standard governs [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) measurements and disclosures in [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) under U.S. GAAP.
2. **IFRS 13**: Similar to ASC 820, it provides guidelines on [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) measurements under International Financial Reporting Standards.

Both standards aim to ensure consistency and comparability in [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) measurements and provide [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on inputs, [valuation techniques](../v/valuation_techniques.md), and necessary disclosures.

## Challenges in Valuation

Valuing Level 2 assets poses several challenges due to the nature of their inputs and [market](../m/market.md) conditions:

1. **Data Reliability**: Ensuring the reliability and relevancy of observable inputs can be difficult, especially in non-active markets.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Rapid changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions can affect the validity of models and assumptions used in valuations.
3. **Complex Modelling Requirements**: Developing and maintaining [robust](../r/robust.md) [valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md) that depend on various observable inputs require extensive expertise and resources.

## Conclusion

Level 2 assets play a vital role in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and institutions. Their [valuation](../v/valuation.md), while more complex than [Level 1 assets](../l/level_1_assets.md), strikes a balance by utilizing observable inputs and sophisticated models. Understanding these assets, their [valuation](../v/valuation.md) methods, and related regulatory frameworks helps in appreciating the nuanced [transparency](../t/transparency.md) they [offer](../o/offer.md) in financial reporting.
