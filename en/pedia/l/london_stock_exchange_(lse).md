# London Stock Exchange (LSE)

The London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LSE) is one of the largest and most prominent stock exchanges in the world. Founded in 1698, it is situated in the City of London, the financial heart of the United Kingdom. The LSE provides a platform for companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public and facilitates trading of those [shares](../s/shares.md) among financial institutions and individual investors.

## History and Evolution

The origins of the LSE date back to the late 17th century when stockbrokers began to meet in London coffee houses to buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md). The establishment was formalized in 1801 when the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) officially opened. Over the centuries, the LSE has undergone numerous changes, including mergers, technological advancements, and shifts in regulatory frameworks. Notably, in 2007, the LSE merged with Borsa Italiana to form the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Group (LSEG).

## Operations and Structure

The London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) operates several markets, each with specific requirements and characteristics:

- **Main [Market](../m/market.md)**: This is the [principal](../p/principal.md) [market](../m/market.md) for larger, established companies that meet stringent regulatory and financial criteria. Companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the Main [Market](../m/market.md) have greater [visibility](../v/visibility.md), reputation, and often access to more [capital](../c/capital.md).

- **AIM ([Alternative Investment](../a/alternative_investment.md) [Market](../m/market.md))**: Launched in 1995, AIM caters to smaller, growing companies that may not yet meet the criteria for the Main [Market](../m/market.md). AIM provides a platform for these firms to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) in a more flexible regulatory environment.

- **Specialist [Fund](../f/fund.md) Segment**: This segment is designed for specialist funds, such as [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds, which target institutional investors.

## Listing Requirements

The process of listing on the LSE is rigorous, especially for the Main [Market](../m/market.md). Requirements include:
