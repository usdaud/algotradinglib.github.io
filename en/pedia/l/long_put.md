# Long Put

In the realm of [options](../o/options.md) trading and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), the "long put" is a fundamental strategy that allows traders to [profit](../p/profit.md) from a decline in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This article delves into the intricacies of the long put strategy, providing a comprehensive definition, detailed examples, and a comparison with shorting stock. Understanding these concepts is crucial for traders and investors seeking to diversify their strategies and enhance their [risk management techniques](../r/risk_management_techniques.md).

## Definition of Long Put

A long put is an option strategy where an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a [put option](../p/put.md) with the expectation that the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price [will](../w/will.md) decline. A [put option](../p/put.md) gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified price (the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) before or at the option's [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). The buyer of a [put option](../p/put.md) pays a [premium](../p/premium.md) for this right.

By using a long put strategy, an [investor](../i/investor.md) can [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the downward movement in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) without actually holding or owning the [asset](../a/asset.md). This strategy can be employed as a form of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential losses in an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock position.

### Key Features of a Long Put

- **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md):** The price at which the holder can sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md):** The date by which the option must be exercised or it [will](../w/will.md) expire worthless.
- **[Premium](../p/premium.md):** The amount paid to purchase the [put option](../p/put.md).
- **[Intrinsic Value](../i/intrinsic_value.md):** The difference between the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and the current price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), if it is in-the-[money](../m/money.md) (i.e., the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is higher than the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md)).

## Example of Long Put

To illustrate the long put strategy, consider an [investor](../i/investor.md), Jane, who is bearish on XYZ [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s stock, currently trading at $100. Jane purchases a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $95, expiring in one month, for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $3.

### Possible Scenarios

1. **Stock Price Falls to $85:**
 - Jane exercises the [put option](../p/put.md), selling XYZ stock at $95.
 - The [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of the option is $10 [$95 ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) - $85 (current price)].
 - Since she paid a $3 [premium](../p/premium.md), her net [profit](../p/profit.md) is $7 per share [$10 [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) - $3 [premium](../p/premium.md)].

2. **Stock Price Falls to $95:**
 - Jane exercises the [put option](../p/put.md), selling XYZ stock at $95.
 - The [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of the option is $0 as the [market price](../m/market_price.md) equals the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
 - Jane incurs a loss equal to the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid, which is $3.

3. **Stock Price Remains at $100:**
 - The option expires worthless as there is no benefit in selling at $95 when the [market price](../m/market_price.md) is $100.
 - Jane's total loss is the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid, i.e., $3.

4. **Stock Price Rises to $110:**
 - The option expires worthless.
 - Jane loses $3, the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid for the option.

This example demonstrates how a long put strategy can limit losses to the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid while [offering](../o/offering.md) significant potential gains if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price declines.

## Long Put vs. Shorting Stock

Both the long put and [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) strategies are bearish tactics employed to [profit](../p/profit.md) from a decline in the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md). However, these strategies differ significantly in terms of mechanics, risks, and potential rewards.

### Shorting Stock

Shorting a stock involves borrowing [shares](../s/shares.md) of the stock and selling them at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) with the intention of repurchasing them later at a lower price to [return](../r/return.md) to the [lender](../l/lender.md). The [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss is derived from the difference between the selling and repurchase prices, minus any associated borrowing fees.

#### Characteristics of Shorting Stock

- **Unlimited Losses:** If the stock price rises, the short seller must still repurchase the stock at the higher price, potentially incurring unlimited losses.
- **Borrowing Costs:** The short seller incurs borrowing costs which can be substantial, especially for hard-to-borrow [stocks](../s/stock.md).
- **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements:** [Short selling](../s/short_selling.md) typically requires a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md), and the [trader](../t/trader.md) must maintain sufficient [equity](../e/equity.md) to cover potential losses.
- **Regulatory Constraints:** [Short selling](../s/short_selling.md) can be subject to regulations, such as the [uptick rule](../u/uptick_rule.md) and [short sale](../s/short_sale.md) restrictions during volatile [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Comparison with Long Put

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Profile:** A long put has a maximum loss limited to the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid for the option, while shorting stock can result in unlimited losses if the stock price rises significantly.
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements:** Buying a long [put option](../p/put.md) generally requires less [capital](../c/capital.md) than shorting a stock due to the limited [premium](../p/premium.md) cost versus the [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements for [short selling](../s/short_selling.md).
- **[Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md):** Long [put options](../p/put_options.md) are subject to [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) ([theta](../t/theta.md)), meaning they lose [value](../v/value.md) as the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) approaches, irrespective of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price movement. Short positions in stock are not affected by [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).
- **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md):** Long puts can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) gains through the relatively small initial [premium](../p/premium.md) cost, [offering](../o/offering.md) a high reward potential if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price falls significantly.

### Example Comparison

#### Long Put Example Revisited

- **Stock Price Falls to $85:**
 - Jane buys a [put option](../p/put.md) at $95 strike for $3.
 - [Intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) = $95 - $85 = $10.
 - Net [Profit](../p/profit.md) = $10 - $3 = $7 per share.

#### Short Selling Example (Same Scenario)

- **Stock Price Falls to $85:**
 - Jane shorts 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) at $100.
 - Repurchases at $85.
 - [Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md) = ($100 - $85) * 100 = $1500.
 - Subtract borrowing costs and commissions to determine net [profit](../p/profit.md).

In both cases, Jane profits from the stock’s decline. However, the risks and costs associated with each strategy differ. In the long put scenario, Jane's [risk](../r/risk.md) is limited to the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid, whereas shorting the stock exposes her to potentially infinite losses if the stock price increases.

## Conclusion

The long [put option](../p/put.md) strategy offers investors a controlled [risk](../r/risk.md) approach to [profit](../p/profit.md) from anticipated declines in the price of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). By purchasing a [put option](../p/put.md), investors limit their potential losses to the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid while retaining significant [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md) if their bearish outlook proves correct.

In contrast, [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) a stock carries [unlimited risk](../u/unlimited_risk.md) and requires more complex management of borrowed [shares](../s/shares.md) and [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements. Understanding the nuances of both strategies, including their respective [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, empowers investors to make informed decisions tailored to their financial goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

Incorporating long puts into a diversified [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) can enhance [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), providing a cushion against unfavorable [market](../m/market.md) movements and [offering](../o/offering.md) opportunities to [profit](../p/profit.md) in bearish [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Whether used as a standalone strategy or a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against existing positions, long puts are a valuable tool in the [options](../o/options.md) [trader](../t/trader.md)’s arsenal.
