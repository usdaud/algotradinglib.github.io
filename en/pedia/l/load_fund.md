# Load Fund

## Introduction
A [load](../l/load.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) is a type of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) that comes with sales charges or commissions when investors buy or sell [shares](../s/shares.md). These charges are used to compensate the [broker](../b/broker.md) or [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) who sells the [fund](../f/fund.md). [Load](../l/load.md) funds can be broken down into three main categories: [front-end load](../f/front-end_load.md), back-end [load](../l/load.md), and level [load](../l/load.md) funds. Understanding these types of funds can help investors make more informed decisions about where and how to allocate their [capital](../c/capital.md).

## Types of Load Funds

### Front-End Load Funds
[Front-end load](../f/front-end_load.md) funds charge a percentage [fee](../f/fee.md) when investors purchase [shares](../s/shares.md). This [fee](../f/fee.md) is deducted from the total amount invested, meaning that if an [investor](../i/investor.md) purchases $10,000 worth of [shares](../s/shares.md) with a 5% [front-end load](../f/front-end_load.md), $500 [will](../w/will.md) be taken out for the [fee](../f/fee.md), and $9,500 [will](../w/will.md) be invested in the [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md).

#### Example
- Purchase Amount: $10,000
- [Front-End Load](../f/front-end_load.md): 5%
- [Fee](../f/fee.md): $500
- Amount Invested: $9,500

### Back-End Load Funds
Back-end [load](../l/load.md) funds, also known as deferred sales charge funds, charge a [fee](../f/fee.md) when investors sell their [shares](../s/shares.md). The [fee](../f/fee.md) usually decreases over time, often disappearing entirely after a certain period, such as five to seven years. The [fee](../f/fee.md) structure is designed to encourage long-term investment.

#### Example
- Purchase Amount: $10,000
- Back-End [Load](../l/load.md) Schedule:
 - Year 1: 5%
 - Year 2: 4%
 - Year 3: 3%
 - Year 4: 2%
 - Year 5: 1%
 - Year 6 onwards: 0%

### Level Load Funds
Level [load](../l/load.md) funds charge a small percentage each year as long as the [investor](../i/investor.md) holds the [fund](../f/fund.md). This ongoing [fee](../f/fee.md) is deducted from the assets of the [fund](../f/fund.md) itself, impacting the overall [return](../r/return.md) over the long term. These are often referred to as [12b-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md).

#### Example
- Purchase Amount: $10,000
- Annual [12b-1 Fee](../1/12b-1_fee.md): 1%
- First-Year [Fee](../f/fee.md): $100
- Second-Year [Fee](../f/fee.md): $100 (assuming the amount invested remains the same)

## Importance of Load Funds

### Compensation for Advisors
One of the primary purposes of [load](../l/load.md) funds is to compensate financial advisors and brokers who provide investment advice and management services. Despite the additional costs, some investors prefer [load](../l/load.md) funds for the professional [guidance](../g/guidance.md) and additional support they receive.

### Impact on Investment Returns
The fees associated with [load](../l/load.md) funds can significantly affect overall returns. Front-end and back-end loads reduce the initial or final investment amount, while level loads continually erode returns over time. It's crucial for investors to weigh the benefits of professional advice against the cost of these fees.

### Comparison to No-Load Funds
No-[load](../l/load.md) funds do not charge any sales commissions or fees. This can make them more attractive for DIY investors who do not need the services of a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md). However, they may still have other fees, such as management fees, which can impact overall returns.

## Regulatory Aspects

### SEC Regulation
[Load](../l/load.md) funds are regulated by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) and must adhere to rules designed to protect investors. The fees must be clearly disclosed in the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [prospectus](../p/prospectus.md), and advisors are required to act in the best [interest](../i/interest.md) of their clients.

### Disclosure Requirements
[Fund](../f/fund.md) companies are required to provide detailed information about fees, including how they are calculated and deducted. This enables investors to make informed decisions and understand the cost structure before [investing](../i/investing.md).

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Front-End Load Fund
An [investor](../i/investor.md) chooses a [front-end load](../f/front-end_load.md) [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) with a 5% [fee](../f/fee.md) and invests $20,000. The [fee](../f/fee.md) is $1,000, leaving $19,000 invested. Over five years, the [fund](../f/fund.md) grows at an average annual rate of 8%, resulting in a portfolio [value](../v/value.md) of approximately $27,836. The initial [load](../l/load.md) [fee](../f/fee.md) reduces the overall [return](../r/return.md) compared to a [no-load fund](../n/no-load_fund.md).

### Case Study 2: Back-End Load Fund
Another [investor](../i/investor.md) opts for a back-end [load](../l/load.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) with a 5% [fee](../f/fee.md) decreasing to 0% after five years. They invest $20,000, and after five years, the [fund](../f/fund.md) grows at an average rate of 8% per year, resulting in a [value](../v/value.md) of approximately $29,389. If they withdraw the entire amount after five years, no [fee](../f/fee.md) is applied, maximizing their returns compared to early withdrawals.

### Case Study 3: Level Load Fund
A third [investor](../i/investor.md) chooses a level [load](../l/load.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) with a 1% annual [fee](../f/fee.md). They invest $20,000, and the [fund](../f/fund.md) grows at an average annual rate of 8%, resulting in a [value](../v/value.md) of approximately $27,528 after fees are deducted over five years. The annual fees continually reduce the overall growth, demonstrating the impact of level loads on [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md).

## Conclusion

[Load](../l/load.md) funds serve a specific purpose in the financial landscape by compensating advisors and brokers for their services. While they provide valuable support and [guidance](../g/guidance.md), the associated fees can impact overall returns. Investors must carefully consider their needs, investment goals, and the cost of these fees when choosing between [load](../l/load.md) funds, no-[load](../l/load.md) funds, or other investment [options](../o/options.md). Understanding the different types of [load](../l/load.md) funds and their [fee](../f/fee.md) structures empowers investors to make more informed financial decisions.
