# Liberty Bond

A Liberty [Bond](../b/bond.md) was a war [bond](../b/bond.md) issued in the United States during World War I to support the allied cause in World War I. Subscribing to the bonds became a symbol of patriotic duty in the United States and introduced the idea of financial securities to many citizens for the first time.

These bonds were sold to American citizens to help [finance](../f/finance.md) the war effort. The bonds offered a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) and were considered a safe and patriotic investment. The campaign for these bonds was the largest financial mobilization in American history up to that point, and it massively promoted the idea of widespread financial participation.

## Historical Context

Liberty Bonds were introduced by the U.S. government shortly after the country entered World War I in 1917. At this time, the U.S. needed to raise significant funds to support its involvement in the war, including costs related to military expenditures, equipment, and assistance to allies. The government saw the issuance of bonds as a viable way to involve the American public in the war effort financially.

### The Four Liberty Loan Acts

The Liberty [Bond](../b/bond.md) program consisted of four separate [bond](../b/bond.md) issues, authorized by four Liberty [Loan](../l/loan.md) Acts passed between 1917 and 1918.

1. **First Liberty [Loan](../l/loan.md)**: This initial series of bonds was issued in April 1917 and aimed to raise $2 billion. These bonds had a 3.5% [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and were set to mature in 30 years.

2. **Second Liberty [Loan](../l/loan.md)**: Issued in October 1917, these bonds offered a 4% [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and aimed to raise another $3 billion.

3. **Third Liberty [Loan](../l/loan.md)**: Issued in April 1918, with a target of $3 billion, these bonds offered a 4.5% [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and were to mature in 15 years.

4. **Fourth Liberty [Loan](../l/loan.md)**: Issued in September 1918, this series aimed to raise $6 billion with an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) of 4.25%.

Each of these [bond](../b/bond.md) issues was [oversubscribed](../o/oversubscribed.md), meaning the government received more [money](../m/money.md) than it initially sought to raise, indicating the program's success and popularity.

## Marketing and Propaganda

The U.S. government employed a massive [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and propaganda campaign to sell Liberty Bonds. Advertisements were placed in newspapers, magazines, on billboards, and even in movie theaters. Celebrities, including Hollywood stars and famous athletes, were enlisted to promote the bonds. Patriotic posters were created to encourage Americans to contribute to the war effort by buying Liberty Bonds.

One of the most famous slogans used to promote Liberty Bonds was "Buy bonds until it hurts." The government also organized Liberty [Loan](../l/loan.md) parades, featuring floats, bands, and speakers to stir public [interest](../i/interest.md) and promote [bond](../b/bond.md) sales.

Furthermore, a great group of volunteer salespeople known as the "four-minute men" delivered convincing speeches in theaters and other public places, explaining the [value](../v/value.md) of purchasing bonds.

## Financial Impact

[Money](../m/money.md) raised through the [sale](../s/sale.md) of Liberty Bonds was crucial in [financing](../f/financing.md) the U.S. war effort. The proceeds from the bonds went toward paying for military equipment, supplies, and other war-related expenses. Additionally, the funds helped support the allies by providing loans and financial aid.

Liberty Bonds played a significant role in shaping the U.S. financial landscape, introducing many Americans to the concept of securities for the first time. It also established a precedent for future [government bond](../g/government_bond.md) programs, including those that funded World War II.

## Legacy

Beyond their immediate financial impact, Liberty Bonds left a lasting legacy on American society and the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). They fostered a sense of unity and collective responsibility among citizens during a critical time in history.

The success of the Liberty [Bond](../b/bond.md) program demonstrated that the American public was willing and able to provide significant financial support for major national causes. This realization paved the way for future [government bond](../g/government_bond.md) initiatives and encouraged the participation of ordinary citizens in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

In the post-war period, the experience gained in issuing and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) Liberty Bonds served as a valuable blueprint for subsequent [bond](../b/bond.md) programs, most notably [War Bonds](../w/war_bond.md) sold during World War II.
