# Carding

Carding is a type of [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md) in which individuals exploit stolen or fraudulent [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) information to purchase goods or services without the original cardholder’s consent. This illicit practice is performed by “carders,” individuals who specialize in the theft and [sale](../s/sale.md) of [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) information. Carding is a cybercrime that causes significant financial damage to victims and poses major challenges to legal and financial institutions worldwide.

## Techniques Used in Carding

Carding involves a variety of techniques to obtain [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) details and successfully execute fraudulent transactions. Some common methods include:

### Phishing

Phishing is a social engineering attack where fraudsters trick individuals into disclosing personal and financial information through deceptive emails, websites, or messages. These communications usually mimic legitimate entities, such as banks or online retailers.

### Skimming

Skimming involves the use of physical devices attached to ATMs, point-of-[sale](../s/sale.md) (POS) systems, and gas station pumps to capture the card information of users. These devices often include a tiny hidden camera to record PIN codes entered by unsuspecting cardholders.

### Hacking

Hackers can infiltrate computer systems, databases, and networks to retrieve [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) information. This could involve breaching the [security](../s/security.md) of online retailers, financial institutions, or [payment](../p/payment.md) processors through methods such as SQL injections, malware, or brute-force attacks.

### Dark Web Markets

Carders often purchase stolen [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) information from [dark web](../d/dark_web.md) marketplaces where such data is sold. These markets operate on the [dark web](../d/dark_web.md), a part of the internet not indexed by traditional search engines and accessible through special software like Tor.

## Steps Involved in Carding

The carding process generally involves several stages, each requiring a specific set of skills and resources:

1. **[Acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of Card Information**: Carders obtain [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) data through any of the techniques mentioned above. This data typically includes the card number, [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), and Card Verification [Value](../v/value.md) (CVV) code.

2. **Validation**: Before using the stolen card information, carders test its validity. They perform small transactions or verify details through carding forums and communities to ensure the card is active and has available [credit](../c/credit.md).

3. **Exploitation**: Once validated, the carder uses the stolen [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) information to make unauthorized purchases. These could [range](../r/range.md) from physical goods, which are shipped to untraceable addresses, to digital products and services.

4. **Monetization**: The final step involves converting the purchased items into cash. Carders may resell the goods online, use them or [exchange](../e/exchange.md) them directly for [money](../m/money.md).

## Consequences of Carding

### Financial Losses

Carding leads to significant financial losses for individuals, businesses, and financial institutions. Victims of carding can face unauthorized charges, [depletion](../d/depletion.md) of funds, and even compromised [credit](../c/credit.md) scores.

### Legal Repercussions

Carding is a criminal offense, and those caught engaging in or facilitating carding can face severe legal consequences. Penalties may include imprisonment, fines, and restitution to victims.

### Security Challenges

The persistent nature of carding necessitates ongoing efforts by financial institutions and [security](../s/security.md) professionals to combat [fraud](../f/fraud.md). Advanced [security](../s/security.md) measures, such as EMV (Europay, [MasterCard](../m/mastercard.md), and Visa) chip technology, tokenization, and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md)-based [fraud](../f/fraud.md) detection systems, are employed to mitigate risks.

## Prevention Measures

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Implementing multi-[factor](../f/factor.md) authentication adds an additional layer of [security](../s/security.md) by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors. This reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access to accounts.

### Encryption

Encrypting sensitive data ensures that even if it is intercepted, it remains unreadable and unusable to unauthorized individuals.

### Regular Monitoring

Financial institutions and individuals should regularly monitor account activity for any suspicious transactions. Early detection can prevent further unauthorized charges and limit damages.

### Public Awareness

Educating the public about the risks of phishing, skimming, and other carding techniques is crucial in helping individuals protect their personal and financial information.

## Prominent Carding Cases

### Target Breach (2013)

One of the most significant carding incidents was the Target data breach in 2013. Cybercriminals infiltrated Target’s systems, stealing [credit](../c/credit.md) and [debit](../d/debit.md) card information of up to 40 million customers. The breach also exposed the personal information of up to 70 million additional individuals, leading to substantial financial losses and damage to Target’s reputation.

### Heartland Payment Systems (2008)

In another major case, Heartland [Payment](../p/payment.md) Systems, a [payment](../p/payment.md) processing company, experienced a data breach in 2008. Attackers installed malware on the company's network, compromising over 100 million [credit](../c/credit.md) and [debit](../d/debit.md) card accounts. The incident prompted widespread concern and led to enhanced [security](../s/security.md) measures across the [payment](../p/payment.md) [industry](../i/industry.md).

Carding remains a pervasive [issue](../i/issue.md) in the digital age, posing continuous challenges to cybersecurity and financial systems globally. Through collaboration, advanced [security](../s/security.md) practices, and public education, efforts to combat carding can help reduce its impact and protect consumers.
