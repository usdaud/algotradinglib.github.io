# Change Point Detection

Change Point Detection (CPD) refers to the process of identifying points in time where the statistical properties of a sequence of observations change. In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), change point detection can be crucial for identifying changes in [market](../m/market.md) regimes, [volatility](../v/volatility.md) shifts, or other significant events that could affect [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Importance of Change Point Detection in Trading

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Regime Shifts](../r/regime_shifts_in_trading.md)**:
    - [Financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) often exhibit different regimes characterized by distinct statistical properties.
    - [Regime shifts](../r/regime_shifts_in_trading.md) can include transitions from [bull](../b/bull.md) markets to bear markets or periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to low [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
    - Detecting these changes timely can enable traders to adjust their strategies to mitigate risks and exploit new opportunities.

2. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Shifts**:
    - [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) is a measure of the degree of variation in trading prices over time.
    - Sudden changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) are common in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and can impact the performance of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
    - Identifying points where [volatility](../v/volatility.md) changes can inform [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices and trigger the adjustment of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

3. **Predictive Modelling**:
    - [Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and statistical models used in trading rely on the assumption that the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) data-generating process remains stable.
    - Change points can signify [structural breaks](../s/structural_breaks_in_trading.md) that necessitate model retraining or recalibration.

## Methods for Change Point Detection

Several methods exist for detecting change points, each with its strengths and applications:

1. **Statistical Tests**:
    - **Cumulative Sum (CUSUM)**: A method that evaluates the cumulative sum of deviations from the mean to detect changes.
    - **Z Score Test**: Identifies points where the observed [value](../v/value.md) significantly deviates from the expected [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md).
    - **Likelihood Ratio Tests**: Compare the likelihood of data under different hypothesis models to identify change points.

2. **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) Approaches**:
    - **[Supervised Learning](../s/supervised_learning.md)**: Algorithms can be trained to predict change points using labeled historical data.
    - **[Unsupervised Learning](../u/unsupervised_learning.md)**: Methods like clustering and [anomaly detection](../a/anomaly_detection.md) can identify change points without labeled data.

3. **Bayesian Methods**:
    - Bayesian techniques incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs as new data arrives.
    - **Bayesian Online Change Point Detection (BOCPD)**: A recursive algorithm that provides a probabilistic framework for detecting change points in real-time.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

1. **[Adaptive Strategies](../a/adaptive_strategies.md)**:
    - Algorithms can be designed to adapt their parameters or switch strategies upon detecting a change point.
    - For instance, a [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategy might switch to a mean-reversion strategy when a regime shift is detected.

2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**:
    - By detecting [volatility](../v/volatility.md) shifts or abrupt [market](../m/market.md) changes, algorithms can dynamically adjust position sizes or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) positions to control [risk](../r/risk.md).
    - Sudden changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions can be mitigated by executing protective orders when change points are detected.

3. **Enhanced [Predictive Models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md)**:
    - Incorporating change point detection improves the robustness of [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [structural breaks](../s/structural_breaks_in_trading.md).
    - This can lead to more accurate forecasts and better-informed trading decisions.

## Example Study: Change Point Detection in Forex Markets

A study aimed at identifying change points in Forex [market](../m/market.md) data might proceed as follows:
- **Data Collection**: Gather historical [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) data for [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs such as EUR/USD, GBP/USD, etc.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean the data and remove [noise](../n/noise.md) using statistical techniques.
- **Method Selection**: Implement and compare various CPD methods such as CUSUM, BOCPD, and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) approaches.
- **Evaluation**: Validate the detected change points against known [market](../m/market.md) events and analyze their impact on [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) performance.

## Tools and Libraries for CPD

Several libraries and tools are available to assist in implementing Change Point Detection:

1. **R Packages**:
    - **changepoint**: Provides methods for detecting [multiple](../m/multiple.md) changepoints in datasets.
    - **bcp**: Implements Bayesian change point detection.

2. **Python Libraries**:
    - **ruptures**: A Python library for performing offline change point detection on non-stationary signals.
      [ruptures documentation](https://centre-borelli.github.io/ruptures-docs/)
    - **pyBOCPD**: A Python implementation of Bayesian Online Change Point Detection.

## Conclusion

Change Point Detection is a critical component in the toolkit of algorithmic traders. By accurately identifying shifts in [market](../m/market.md) regimes, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and other statistical properties, traders can improve strategy performance, manage risks more effectively, and enhance the accuracy of [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md). The ongoing development and refinement of CPD methods [hold](../h/hold.md) promising potential for further advancements in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies.
