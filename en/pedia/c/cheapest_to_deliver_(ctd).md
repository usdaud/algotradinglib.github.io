# Cheapest to Deliver (CTD)

## Definition of Cheapest to Deliver (CTD)

In the realm of [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) trading, the term "Cheapest to Deliver" (CTD) refers to the process of selecting the [bond](../b/bond.md) that minimizes the cost of fulfilling a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) obligation. The CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) is the specific [bond](../b/bond.md) that a short position holder in a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) [will](../w/will.md) deliver to the long position holder at the [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of the contract. The selection of the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) is vital as it directly impacts the profitability and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) of traders and portfolio managers.

The CTD concept is most commonly associated with [interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md), particularly Treasury [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). These [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are standard financial contracts that require the delivery of a specified amount of a [government bond](../g/government_bond.md) at a predetermined future date. For example, [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) are standardized contracts traded on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CME Group) which is accessible via the following link: CME Group.

## Importance of Cheapest to Deliver (CTD)

The CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) is crucial in the context of [fixed income derivatives](../f/fixed_income_derivatives.md) for several reasons:

1. **Cost [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Identifying the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) allows traders to minimize the cost incurred during the delivery process of a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md). By delivering the least expensive [bond](../b/bond.md), traders can optimize their financial outcomes.

2. **Hedging**: Effective identification of the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) is essential for [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md). It enables traders to align their [futures](../f/futures.md) positions with the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) cash bonds more accurately, thus mitigating [basis risk](../b/basis_risk.md).

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: The selection of CTD bonds influences [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Bonds that are frequently identified as CTD become more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) due to the increased trading activity.

4. **Pricing and [Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: Accurate calculation of the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) is vital for the pricing and [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). It ensures that [futures](../f/futures.md) prices reflect the cost of acquiring the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [bond](../b/bond.md) that is cheapest to deliver.

## Calculation Formula for Cheapest to Deliver (CTD)

The determination of the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) involves comparing the cost of delivering various eligible bonds into the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md). The CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) is the one with the lowest cost of delivery, calculated as follows:

\[ \text{CTD Price} = \frac{\text{Cash Price of Bond}}{\text{Conversion Factor}} + \text{[Accrued Interest](../a/accrued_interest.md)} \]

Where:
- **Cash Price of [Bond](../b/bond.md)**: The current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md).
- **Conversion [Factor](../f/factor.md) (CF)**: A [factor](../f/factor.md) provided by the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) (e.g., CME Group) that adjusts the [value](../v/value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) to a standardized [yield](../y/yield.md), allowing for fair comparison across different bonds. The conversion [factor](../f/factor.md) reflects the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [market value](../m/market_value.md) relative to a notional [bond](../b/bond.md) with a fixed [yield](../y/yield.md).
- **[Accrued Interest](../a/accrued_interest.md)**: The [interest](../i/interest.md) that has accumulated on the [bond](../b/bond.md) since the last coupon [payment](../p/payment.md) date up until the delivery date.

The [bond](../b/bond.md) with the lowest CTD Price is identified as the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md). Let's break down the relevant components in detail:

### Cash Price of Bond

The cash price of the [bond](../b/bond.md) is the current trading price in the [bond market](../b/bond_market.md). It includes the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount plus any [market](../m/market.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) or [discount](../d/discount.md).

### Conversion Factor (CF)

The conversion [factor](../f/factor.md) is calculated by the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and reflects the [present value](../p/present_value.md) adjustment for different [bond](../b/bond.md) characteristics, such as [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md) and time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md). The conversion [factor](../f/factor.md) standardizes the [bond](../b/bond.md) to a [yield](../y/yield.md) of 6% for [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [futures](../f/futures.md), which allows for fair comparisons.

\[ \text{Conversion Factor} = \frac{\text{Factor Value}}{\text{[Par Value](../p/par_value.md)}} \]

The [factor](../f/factor.md) [value](../v/value.md) is influenced by the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md) and [maturity](../m/maturity.md):
- **Higher Coupon Bonds**: Generally have higher conversion factors because they pay more [interest](../i/interest.md).
- **Longer [Maturity](../m/maturity.md) Bonds**: Lower conversion factors because they are subject to more [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md).

### Accrued Interest

[Accrued interest](../a/accrued_interest.md) is calculated as the [interest](../i/interest.md) accumulated on the [bond](../b/bond.md) since the last coupon [payment](../p/payment.md). This is done using the following formula:

\[ \text{[Accrued Interest](../a/accrued_interest.md)} = \frac{\text{Coupon [Payment](../p/payment.md)} \times \text{Days Since Last Coupon [Payment](../p/payment.md)}}{\text{Days in Coupon Period}} \]

### Example Calculation

Assume we have three bonds eligible for delivery into a Treasury [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md). Here are their respective details:

1. **[Bond](../b/bond.md) A**:
 - Cash Price: $101.00
 - Conversion [Factor](../f/factor.md): 0.9785
 - [Accrued Interest](../a/accrued_interest.md): $1.20

2. **[Bond](../b/bond.md) B**:
 - Cash Price: $102.50
 - Conversion [Factor](../f/factor.md): 0.9850
 - [Accrued Interest](../a/accrued_interest.md): $1.50

3. **[Bond](../b/bond.md) C**:
 - Cash Price: $100.75
 - Conversion [Factor](../f/factor.md): 0.9700
 - [Accrued Interest](../a/accrued_interest.md): $1.10

Now, calculate the CTD Price for each [bond](../b/bond.md):

1. **[Bond](../b/bond.md) A:**
\[ \text{CTD Price} = \frac{101.00}{0.9785} + 1.20 = 103.29 + 1.20 = 104.49 \]

2. **[Bond](../b/bond.md) B:**
\[ \text{CTD Price} = \frac{102.50}{0.9850} + 1.50 = 104.14 + 1.50 = 105.64 \]

3. **[Bond](../b/bond.md) C:**
\[ \text{CTD Price} = \frac{100.75}{0.9700} + 1.10 = 103.87 + 1.10 = 104.97 \]

From the calculations above, **[Bond](../b/bond.md) A** has the lowest CTD Price of 104.49 and is therefore identified as the Cheapest to Deliver.

## Factors Influencing CTD Selection

Several factors influence which [bond](../b/bond.md) becomes the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) for a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md):

1. **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Environment**: Changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates affect [bond](../b/bond.md) prices differently based on their coupons and maturities. During declining [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environments, higher coupon bonds might become cheaper to deliver.

2. **[Yield Curve](../y/yard.md) Shape**: The shape of the [yield curve](../y/yard.md) can impact the relative attractiveness of different bonds. For example, a steepening [yield curve](../y/yard.md) might make longer-[maturity](../m/maturity.md) bonds cheaper to deliver.

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [Supply](../s/supply.md)**: The [supply](../s/supply.md) of specific bonds and their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [market](../m/market.md) can influence the CTD decision. Less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) bonds might have higher [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), affecting their overall delivery costs.

4. **Regulatory and Tax Considerations**: Specific regulations or tax treatments applicable to certain bonds might also affect their desirability as the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md).

## Practical Applications of CTD Concept

### Arbitrage and Hedging Strategies

Traders and portfolio managers can engage in [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) and [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) based on the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md):

- **[Basis](../b/basis.md) Trading**: This strategy involves taking positions in cash bonds and offsetting [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to exploit price discrepancies between the cash and [futures](../f/futures.md) markets.

- **[Yield Curve](../y/yard.md) Positioning**: Identifying the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) helps in making strategic decisions based on anticipated movements in the [yield curve](../y/yard.md).

- **Switcher Sales**: Executing switch trades where higher-priced bonds are sold, and the CTD bonds are purchased to optimize the delivery cost.

### Risk Management

Accurate identification of the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md) aids in effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md):

- **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: By knowing the CTD [bond](../b/bond.md), traders can anticipate [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements for [futures](../f/futures.md) positions more accurately.

- **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: It enables proper [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), which is essential for marking-to-[market](../m/market.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment.
