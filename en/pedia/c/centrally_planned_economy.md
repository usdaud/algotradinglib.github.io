# Centrally Planned Economy

A centrally planned [economy](../e/economy.md), also known as a [command economy](../c/command_economy.md), is an economic system in which the state or government makes all the significant decisions related to the production and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of goods and services. The central authority often dictates what to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce, organizing economic activity through comprehensive central planning rather than the forces of [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) found in a [market economy](../m/market_economy.md).

## Historical Context
Historically, centrally planned economies have been most commonly associated with socialist and communist countries. The most notable examples include the former Soviet Union, Maoist China, and Cuba. These countries adopted central planning as a way to achieve rapid [industrialization](../i/industrialization.md), equitable [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of resources, and overall economic development.

## Key Features

### Government Control

1. **Production Decisions**: In a centrally planned [economy](../e/economy.md), the government decides which goods and services are needed. This decision is often based on national priorities and social goals rather than [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md).

2. **Resource Allocation**: The allocation of resources, including labor, [capital](../c/capital.md), and natural resources, is centrally coordinated. This aims to ensure efficient utilization of resources to meet national objectives.

3. **Pricing**: The prices of goods and services are determined by the government. This is intended to stabilize the [economy](../e/economy.md) and avoid the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) found in free markets.

### Lack of Competition

A centrally planned [economy](../e/economy.md) generally sees little to no competition among businesses. Since the government controls all major industries and often owns the means of production, private entrepreneurship is either restricted or entirely nonexistent. This leads to monopolies in various sectors, guided and controlled by state policy.

### Five-Year Plans

One common mechanism for implementing central planning is through multi-year plans, often spanning five years. These plans lay out the specific economic objectives and the means by which they should be achieved. The Soviet Union, for example, was famous for its Five-Year Plans, which aimed to transform the country from a predominantly agrarian society into an industrial powerhouse.

### Labour and Employment

In a centrally planned [economy](../e/economy.md), employment is typically guaranteed by the state. The government assigns jobs to individuals according to the needs identified in the central plan. While this ensures [full employment](../f/full_employment.md), it can also lead to inefficiencies as employees may not be working in fields where their labor is most valued or productive.

## Advantages

### Economic Security

One of the main advantages of a centrally planned [economy](../e/economy.md) is economic [security](../s/security.md). Since the government guarantees employment and regulates prices, citizens often enjoy a stable [standard of living](../s/standard_of_living.md). Essential services like healthcare, education, and housing are typically provided by the state, reducing economic disparities.

### Rapid Mobilization of Resources

The state’s ability to mobilize resources quickly is another significant advantage. In times of national emergency, such as war or natural disasters, the government can rapidly redirect resources to address immediate needs. This [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) is less commonly found in [market](../m/market.md)-driven economies, where resource allocation depends on [multiple](../m/multiple.md) independent actors.

### Environmental and Social Goals

Centrally planned economies can more easily pursue long-term environmental and social objectives. By having the authority to legislate and enforce environmental regulations, the government can directly tackle issues like pollution and climate change. It also allows for the implementation of social programs aimed at reducing inequality and [poverty](../p/poverty.md).

## Disadvantages

### Inefficiency and Waste

One of the most frequently cited disadvantages of centrally planned economies is inefficiency. Since the government controls all production decisions, there is often little incentive for innovation or [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). This can lead to wasteful use of resources, as the central plan may not accurately reflect the real needs and capabilities of the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Lack of Consumer Choice

In a centrally planned [economy](../e/economy.md), consumer choice is usually limited. Since the government dictates what should be produced, there may be a lack of diversity in available goods and services. This contrasts sharply with [market](../m/market.md) economies, where consumer preferences drive production, resulting in a wider array of choices.

### Bureaucratic Delays

Central planning requires a large bureaucratic apparatus to implement and monitor the economic plans. This can lead to delays and corruption, as layers of administration must be navigated to execute even simple economic transactions. The bureaucratic nature of centrally planned economies can stifle innovation and slow down economic progress.

## Transition to Market Economies

Given the numerous inefficiencies associated with centrally planned economies, many countries have transitioned toward more [market](../m/market.md)-oriented systems over the past few decades. The most notable example is the transformation of Eastern European countries and former Soviet republics following the collapse of [communism](../c/communism.md) in the early 1990s. These countries implemented significant economic reforms, moving towards [market](../m/market.md)-based economies and experiencing substantial, albeit uneven, [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Case Study: The Soviet Union

The Soviet Union serves as a quintessential example of a centrally planned [economy](../e/economy.md). Established after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the Soviet government, led by the Communist Party, took control of the entire [economy](../e/economy.md). Lenin and later Stalin implemented a series of Five-Year Plans that aimed to rapidly industrialize the nation. While these plans achieved some degree of success in terms of industrial output, they were also marked by widespread inefficiencies, resource misallocation, and severe human costs.

## Conclusion
In summary, while centrally planned economies [offer](../o/offer.md) several advantages, including economic [security](../s/security.md) and the ability to achieve rapid resource mobilization, they are often hampered by significant inefficiencies and lack of consumer choice. The historical experiences of countries like the Soviet Union serve as critical case studies on the promises and pitfalls of central economic planning. As the world moves increasingly towards [market](../m/market.md) economies, the lessons from these centrally planned systems remain highly relevant.
