# Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a field of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos.

### Key Components
- **Image Processing:** Techniques to preprocess and enhance visual data.
- **Convolutional [Neural Networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) (CNNs):** Specialized architectures for image recognition.
- **Object Detection and Segmentation:** Identifying and localizing objects within an image.
- **Feature Extraction:** Learning representations from visual data to perform various tasks.

### Applications
- **Image Classification:** Categorizing images into predefined classes.
- **Object Detection:** Identifying and locating objects in images and videos.
- **Facial Recognition:** Recognizing human faces for [security](../s/security.md) and personalization.
- **Medical Imaging:** Assisting in diagnosis by analyzing medical scans.

### Advantages
- Enables automation of tasks that require visual perception.
- Improves accuracy in tasks such as [quality control](../q/quality_control.md) and surveillance.
- Drives innovation in autonomous vehicles and robotics.

### Challenges
- Requires large, labeled datasets for training.
- Sensitive to variations in lighting, occlusion, and viewpoint.
- Computationally demanding, especially for real-time applications.

### Future Outlook
Computer vision is evolving with the integration of [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) techniques, leading to more [robust](../r/robust.md), accurate, and efficient systems across various industries, including healthcare, automotive, and [security](../s/security.md).
