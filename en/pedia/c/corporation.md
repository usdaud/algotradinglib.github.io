# Corporation

A corporation is a specific form of [business](../b/business.md) organization that is legally recognized as a separate entity from its owners, with its own rights and [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Corporations are distinct in that they can enter into contracts, own assets, and incur liabilities independently of their shareholders. This unique structure provides various benefits, including [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) for the shareholders, meaning that they are usually not personally responsible for the corporation's debts and [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Characteristics of Corporations

Corporations have several characteristics that distinguish them from other [business](../b/business.md) entities:

1. **Separate Legal Entity**: A corporation is recognized as a separate legal entity from its shareholders and directors. This allows the corporation to own property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, and perform other legal actions in its own name.

2. **[Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md)**: Shareholders of a corporation are typically not personally liable for the corporation's debts and [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Their [liability](../l/liability.md) is generally limited to the amount they have invested in the corporation.

3. **Perpetual Existence**: Corporations can have an indefinite lifespan, continuing to exist even if the ownership or management changes. This ensures stability and can facilitate long-term planning and investments.

4. **Transferability of [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Ownership interests in a corporation are usually represented by [shares](../s/shares.md) that can be bought, sold, or transferred. This [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) makes it easier to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by selling [shares](../s/shares.md) to a broad base of investors.

5. **Centralized Management**: Corporations are managed by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. The directors appoint officers who [handle](../h/handle.md) the day-to-day operations of the corporation. This structure allows for centralized decision-making and professional management.

## Types of Corporations

Corporations can be classified into several types based on their purpose, structure, and ownership:

1. **C Corporations (C Corps)**: These are the most common type of corporation and are subject to corporate [income tax](../i/income_tax.md). Profits are taxed at the corporate level, and dividends distributed to shareholders are taxed at the individual level, leading to [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md).

2. **S Corporations (S Corps)**: These corporations elect to pass corporate [income](../i/income.md), losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. Shareholders of S corporations report the flow-through of [income](../i/income.md) and losses on their personal tax returns, thereby avoiding [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) at the corporate level.

3. **[Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md) Companies (LLCs)**: An LLC is a hybrid entity that combines the characteristics of a corporation with those of a partnership or [sole proprietorship](../s/sole_proprietorship.md). LLCs provide [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) protection to their owners (members) while allowing profits and losses to be passed through to individual tax returns.

4. **Nonprofit Corporations**: These corporations are formed to pursue charitable, educational, religious, cultural, or scientific goals. They are exempt from federal and state [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and do not distribute profits to their members or directors.

5. **Public Corporations**: These are corporations whose [shares](../s/shares.md) are traded on public stock exchanges. They are subject to strict regulatory requirements and must disclose financial information to the public and regulatory bodies like the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC).

6. **Private Corporations**: These corporations do not have publicly traded [shares](../s/shares.md). They are typically owned by a small group of investors, and their financial information is not required to be disclosed to the public.

## Formation and Governance

The formation and governance of a corporation involve several steps and legal requirements:

1. **[Incorporation](../i/incorporation.md)**: The process of creating a corporation involves filing articles of [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) (also known as a certificate of [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) or [corporate charter](../c/corporate_charter.md)) with the appropriate state agency, usually the Secretary of State. The articles of [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) typically include the corporation's name, purpose, [duration](../d/duration.md), and information about the incorporators and initial directors.

2. **Bylaws**: Corporations must adopt bylaws, which are internal rules governing the management and operation of the corporation. Bylaws typically outline the responsibilities of directors and officers, the process for holding meetings and electing directors, and other essential governance matters.

3. **Board of Directors**: The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of the corporation and making major policy decisions. Directors are elected by the shareholders at the annual meeting or in accordance with the corporation's bylaws.

4. **Officers**: Corporate officers, such as the CEO, CFO, and Secretary, are appointed by the board of directors to manage the corporation's day-to-day operations. Officers have specific duties and authority as outlined in the bylaws and by the board.

5. **Shareholders**: Shareholders are the owners of the corporation. They have the right to vote on significant matters, such as electing directors and approving major transactions. [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meetings are typically held annually, and special meetings can be called as needed.

## Advantages of Corporations

1. **[Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md) Protection**: One of the most significant advantages of a corporation is that shareholders are not personally liable for the corporation's debts and [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This protection encourages investment and entrepreneurship.

2. **Access to [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: Corporations can raise [capital](../c/capital.md) more easily than other [business](../b/business.md) forms by issuing [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds. This ability to attract investment helps corporations grow and expand their operations.

3. **Perpetual Existence**: The perpetual existence of corporations provides stability and continuity, which is beneficial for long-term planning and attracting investors who are interested in sustainable growth.

4. **Transferability of Ownership**: The ability to transfer ownership interests through the [sale](../s/sale.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) makes it easier for corporations to attract and retain investors. It also provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for shareholders who wish to sell their interests.

5. **Professional Management**: The centralized management structure of a corporation allows for the appointment of professional managers and executives, which can lead to more efficient and effective operations.

6. **Tax Benefits**: While corporations are subject to [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md), there are tax advantages, such as the ability to deduct [business](../b/business.md) expenses, benefits, and other deductions that can reduce [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

## Disadvantages of Corporations

1. **[Double Taxation](../d/double_taxation.md)**: C corporations face [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md), where the corporation pays [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on its profits, and shareholders pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on dividends received. This can reduce the overall [return](../r/return.md) on investment for shareholders.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Corporations are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must comply with federal, state, and local laws. This includes filing periodic reports, holding annual meetings, and maintaining corporate records, which can be time-consuming and costly.

3. **Cost of Formation and Maintenance**: Forming and maintaining a corporation can be expensive, with costs associated with [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md), legal fees, annual filings, and record-keeping.

4. **Lack of Control**: Founders and initial owners may lose control over the corporation as it grows and more shareholders are introduced. The board of directors and shareholders have significant influence over major decisions.

5. **Complexity**: The corporate structure can be complex, with formalities such as bylaws, minutes, and resolutions that must be adhered to. This complexity requires careful management and oversight.

## Conclusion

Corporations play a vital role in the global [economy](../e/economy.md) by providing a structure for businesses to grow, raise [capital](../c/capital.md), and achieve longevity.
