# Carriage and Insurance Paid to (CIP)

**Carriage and [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Paid to (CIP)** is an international [trade](../t/trade.md) term, known as an Incoterm, created by the International Chamber of [Commerce](../c/commerce.md) (ICC). [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) define a series of pre-determined commercial terms and are widely used in international commercial transactions or [procurement](../p/procurement.md) processes. CIP specifically details the responsibilities of the seller in providing goods to the destination specified by the buyer, covering carriage and [insurance](../i/insurance.md). This condition helps clarify which party is responsible for costs and risks at various points throughout the transportation process.

## Definition of CIP

Under CIP, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to a carrier or another person nominated by the seller at an agreed-upon place, paying for the carriage to the named place of destination. Furthermore, the seller is required to procure minimum [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage against the buyer's [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss or damage to the goods during the carriage.

### Key Responsibilities Under CIP

1. **Seller's Responsibilities:**
 - **Delivery:** The seller must deliver the goods by placing them at the disposal of the carrier they have contracted, on the date or within the period mutually agreed upon.
 - **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md):** The seller is obliged to take out [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage at their [expense](../e/expense.md), with minimum coverage. However, if additional coverage is needed, the buyer [will](../w/will.md) have to arrange for it.
 - **Costs:** The seller bears all costs until the goods are delivered to the carrier. This includes [export](../e/export.md) clearance and any loading costs.
 - **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Transfer:** The [risk](../r/risk.md) transfers from the seller to the buyer once the goods have been delivered to the first carrier. From this point on, the buyer assumes any [risk](../r/risk.md) for loss or damage to the goods.
 - **Documentation:** The seller must provide the buyer with the transport document necessary for the latter to obtain the goods from the carrier.

2. **Buyer's Responsibilities:**
 - **[Import](../i/import.md) Clearance:** The buyer is responsible for handling all [import](../i/import.md) formalities and [clearing](../c/clearing.md) the goods through customs in the destination country.
 - **Costs:** Upon the goods' arrival at the destination, the buyer assumes all costs, including unloading, [import](../i/import.md) duties, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and transport to the final destination.
 - **[Risk](../r/risk.md):** As mentioned earlier, the [risk](../r/risk.md) transfers to the buyer once the goods are delivered to the carrier.

## Example of CIP

Assume that a seller in Germany is exporting machinery to a buyer in Brazil. They agree to use the CIP term, with the port of Santos in Brazil being the named place of destination. Here's how the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) might unfold:

1. **Contract Agreement:** Both parties agree upon the CIP Incoterm and the port of Santos as the destination.
2. **Seller's Actions:**
 - The seller arranges and pays for the transportation of the machinery from their factory in Germany to the port of Santos.
 - The seller also procures an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy to cover the [risk](../r/risk.md) during the international transportation. The coverage needs to be a minimum level [insurance](../i/insurance.md) unless otherwise agreed.
 - After shipping, the seller hands over the necessary documentations such as the [bill of lading](../b/bill_of_lading.md) to the buyer.
3. **Buyer's Actions:**
 - The buyer, after receiving the transport documents, arranges for the [import](../i/import.md) clearance in Brazil and pays any associated tariffs or [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
 - The buyer further organizes local transport to the final destination within Brazil, bearing the costs and risks of this segment.

## Practical Considerations with CIP

- **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Coverage:** The minimum coverage required by CIP may not always be sufficient for all shipments. Buyers and sellers should discuss the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) needs and may agree upon a higher level of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) if necessary.
- **Carrier Responsibilities:** Since responsibility and [risk](../r/risk.md) transfer to the buyer once the goods are in the hands of the first carrier, the choice of a reliable carrier is crucial.
- **Customs Clearance:** Efficient handling of [export](../e/export.md) and [import](../i/import.md) customs processes is vital to avoid delays, which might affect the delivery schedule.

## Conclusion

The CIP Incoterm offers a clear framework for international [trade](../t/trade.md) transactions, specifying the allocation of costs and risks between the buyer and seller. It is especially useful in scenarios where the buyer needs [assurance](../a/assurance.md) that the seller has covered the transportation and minimum [insurance](../i/insurance.md) costs up to a specific point. Proper understanding and implementation of CIP help avoid disputes and ensure a smooth [transaction](../t/transaction.md) flow.
