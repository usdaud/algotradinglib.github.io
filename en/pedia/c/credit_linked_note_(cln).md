# Credit Linked Note (CLN)

A [Credit](../c/credit.md) Linked [Note](../n/note.md) (CLN) is a type of [credit](../c/credit.md) [derivative](../d/derivative.md) that is structured as a [debt security](../d/debt_security.md) with an embedded [credit](../c/credit.md) [default](../d/default.md) [swap](../s/swap.md) (CDS). This [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) allows the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to transfer [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) from one or more reference entities to the [investor](../i/investor.md). Essentially, a CLN combines the characteristics of a [bond](../b/bond.md) with those of a CDS, providing a unique product that serves both investment and hedging purposes.

## Structure and Components

### Issuer and Investor

In a typical CLN [transaction](../t/transaction.md), there are two main parties involved:

1. **[Issuer](../i/issuer.md)**: The [issuer](../i/issuer.md) of the CLN, often a financial institution, creates and sells the [note](../n/note.md) to the [investor](../i/investor.md).
2. **[Investor](../i/investor.md)**: The buyer of the CLN, usually seeking higher yields or exposure to certain [credit](../c/credit.md) risks.

### Reference Entity

The reference entity is a crucial aspect of the CLN. It is typically a [corporation](../c/corporation.md), sovereign entity, or other form of debtor whose [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) is being transferred. The performance of the reference entity directly impacts the payoff structure of the CLN.

### Maturity Date

CLNs have a predefined [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), which is the date on which the [principal](../p/principal.md) is repaid to the [investor](../i/investor.md), provided no [credit](../c/credit.md) event has occurred.

### Coupons

Similar to traditional bonds, CLNs pay periodic coupons to the [investor](../i/investor.md). These coupon payments are often higher than those of comparable [risk](../r/risk.md)-free bonds, reflecting the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) embedded in the [note](../n/note.md).

### Credit Events

A [credit](../c/credit.md) event triggers the CDS embedded within the CLN. Common [credit](../c/credit.md) events include:

- **[Default](../d/default.md)**: Failure of the reference entity to meet its financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
- **[Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md)**: Legal recognition of [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md).
- **[Restructuring](../r/restructuring.md)**: Changes to the [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of the reference entity that negatively impact the investors.

## Mechanism

When an [investor](../i/investor.md) purchases a CLN, they are effectively selling protection against [credit](../c/credit.md) events related to the reference entity. If no [credit](../c/credit.md) event occurs during the life of the CLN, the [investor](../i/investor.md) receives regular coupon payments and the [return](../r/return.md) of the [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). However, if a [credit](../c/credit.md) event occurs, the [investor](../i/investor.md) typically receives a reduced payoff, determined by the terms of the CDS.

## Pricing and Valuations

The pricing of CLNs involves several factors:

1. **[Credit Spread](../c/credit_spread.md)**: The [yield spread](../y/yield_spread.md) between the reference entity's [debt](../d/debt.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md)-free instruments, which compensates for the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).
2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: The general level of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates affects the [discount](../d/discount.md) [factor](../f/factor.md) applied to future cash flows.
3. **[Recovery Rate](../r/recovery_rate.md)**: The assumed percentage of the [par value](../p/par_value.md) that can be recovered in the event of a [default](../d/default.md).
4. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: The ease of buying and selling CLNs affects their [market price](../m/market_price.md).

## Risks and Considerations

### Credit Risk

The primary [risk](../r/risk.md) in a CLN is the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of the reference entity, which encompasses the potential for a [default](../d/default.md) or other [credit](../c/credit.md) events that can negatively impact payments.

### Market Risk

Changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [credit](../c/credit.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md), and [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can affect the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of a CLN.

### Counterparty Risk

As the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) of the CLN is typically a financial institution, there's a [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) may [default](../d/default.md) on its [obligations](../o/obligation.md), irrespective of the performance of the reference entity.

### Legal and Structural Risks

Given the complexity of CLNs, there are legal and structural risks associated with the specific terms and conditions, which can vary widely across different notes.

## Applications

### Investment

Investors use CLNs to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of specific entities or portfolios of entities without directly holding their bonds. This can provide higher yields compared to traditional bonds due to the embedded [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).

### Hedging

Institutions can use CLNs to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential losses in other parts of their portfolio by transferring [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) to investors.

### Yield Enhancement

CLNs [offer](../o/offer.md) higher coupon rates compared to other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities of similar [credit](../c/credit.md) quality, making them attractive for [yield](../y/yield.md)-seeking investors.

## Market Participants

1. **Banks and Financial Institutions**: Often involved as issuers of CLNs.
2. **Institutional Investors**: Such as pension funds, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, who purchase CLNs for their portfolios.
3. **Corporate Treasuries**: Occasionally engage in CLN transactions for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) purposes.
