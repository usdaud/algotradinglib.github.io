# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM) is a foundational financial theory that establishes a relationship between the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of an investment and its [risk](../r/risk.md) relative to the [market](../m/market.md). It was introduced by Jack Treynor, [William F. Sharpe](../w/william_f._sharpe.md), John Lintner, and Jan Mossin in the 1960s and has since become a central theme in modern portfolio theory and [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md).

## Key Components of CAPM

### Risk and Return

CAPM starts with the premise that investors need to be compensated in two ways: [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md). The [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md) is represented by the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate, typically the [return](../r/return.md) on government bonds. The [risk](../r/risk.md), on the other hand, is measured by the [beta](../b/beta.md) (β) of the investment.

### The CAPM Formula

The basic formula of CAPM is:

\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f) \]

Where:
- \( E(R_i) \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) on the investment
- \( R_f \) is the [risk-free rate of return](../r/risk-free_rate_of_return.md)
- \( \beta_i \) is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the investment
- \( E(R_m) \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the [market](../m/market.md)
- \( E(R_m) - R_f \) is known as the [market risk premium](../m/market_risk_premium.md)

### Beta (β)

[Beta](../b/beta.md) measures the sensitivity of an investment's returns to the returns of the [market](../m/market.md). A [beta](../b/beta.md) of 1 implies that the investment's price [will](../w/will.md) move with the [market](../m/market.md). A [beta](../b/beta.md) less than 1 means that the investment is less volatile than the [market](../m/market.md), and a [beta](../b/beta.md) greater than 1 indicates higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) than the [market](../m/market.md).

### Market Risk Premium

The [market risk premium](../m/market_risk_premium.md) represents the additional [return](../r/return.md) over the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate required by investors to compensate for the higher [risk](../r/risk.md) of [investing](../i/investing.md) in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). It is calculated as the difference between the expected [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md) and the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.

## Assumptions of CAPM

CAPM is built on several key assumptions:
1. **Investors are Rational and [Risk-Averse](../r/risk-averse.md)**: Investors aim to maximize economic [utility](../u/utility.md) and, when faced with a choice between two investments with the same [return](../r/return.md), [will](../w/will.md) prefer the less risky one.
2. **Markets are Efficient**: All pertinent information about [stocks](../s/stock.md) is freely available and instantly absorbed by [market](../m/market.md) prices.
3. **Single Period [Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Horizon**: All investors plan for the same, single period [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md).
4. **[Homogeneous Expectations](../h/homogeneous_expectations.md)**: All investors have the same expectations regarding [asset](../a/asset.md) returns, volatilities, and correlations.
5. **No [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) or [Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: These factors do not affect investment decisions.
6. **Unlimited Borrowing and Lending at the [Risk](../r/risk.md)-Free Rate**: Investors can borrow and lend unlimited amounts at the [risk-free rate of return](../r/risk-free_rate_of_return.md).

## Applications of CAPM

### Portfolio Management

CAPM helps in constructing a balanced portfolio that aims to optimize returns for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md). By predicting an investment's [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) considering its [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md), CAPM enables portfolio managers to decide which assets to include in the portfolio.

### Corporate Finance

In [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), CAPM is used in [capital budgeting](../c/capital_budgeting.md) to estimate a project's [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) and compare it with the cost of [financing](../f/financing.md). This helps in the decision-making process regarding which projects or investments the [firm](../f/firm.md) should undertake to maximize [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

### Performance Evaluation

CAPM provides a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for evaluating the performance of managed portfolios and individual securities. The realized [return](../r/return.md) of an investment can be compared to its CAPM-predicted [return](../r/return.md) to assess whether it performed better or worse than expected given its [risk](../r/risk.md) level.

## Criticisms and Limitations of CAPM

Despite its theoretical elegance and widespread use, CAPM has several limitations:
1. **Real-world Deviations**: The assumptions of CAPM, such as no [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and all investors acting rationally, do not [hold](../h/hold.md) true in real markets.
2. **Estimation of Inputs**: Accurate estimation of [beta](../b/beta.md) and the [market risk premium](../m/market_risk_premium.md) is challenging, leading to potential inaccuracies in the model's predictions.
3. **Static Model**: CAPM is a single-period model, which does not account for changes in [risk](../r/risk.md) and returns over time.
4. **Empirical Evidence**: Some empirical studies have shown that the relationship between [beta](../b/beta.md) and [return](../r/return.md) is not as strong as CAPM predicts, indicating potential anomalies in the model.

## Extensions and Alternatives to CAPM

To address some of CAPM's limitations, various extensions and alternative models have been developed:

### Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)

APT, developed by Stephen Ross in 1976, is a multifactor model that aims to overcome the limitations of CAPM by considering [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sources of [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) beyond just the [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md). APT does not require a [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md) and is based on the idea that [asset](../a/asset.md) returns can be predicted by a [linear relationship](../l/linear_relationship.md) with several macroeconomic factors.

### Fama-French Three-Factor Model

The Fama-French Three-[Factor](../f/factor.md) Model, proposed by Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French, includes two additional factors to CAPM: size of firms (small vs. large) and book-to-[market value](../m/market_value.md) (high vs. low). This model recognizes that small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md) and [stocks](../s/stock.md) with high book-to-[market](../m/market.md) ratios tend to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the CAPM-predicted returns, adding further explanatory power to the model.

### Carhart Four-Factor Model

This model expands the Fama-French model by adding a [momentum factor](../m/momentum_factor.md), acknowledging that [stocks](../s/stock.md) with strong recent performance tend to continue performing well in the short term. The four factors in this model are [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), size, [value](../v/value.md), and [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

## Real-world Examples and Applications

### Investment Firms

Many investment firms use CAPM to guide their [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) strategies. For example, Vanguard, a leading [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) company, employs CAPM to understand the [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) [trade](../t/trade.md)-off of various investment opportunities and to construct diversified portfolios aimed at achieving optimal returns.

### Financial Institutions

Banks and other financial institutions use CAPM for various purposes, including [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [asset](../a/asset.md)-[liability](../l/liability.md) management. By assessing the expected returns against their corresponding risks, these institutions can make informed decisions about lending, investment, and [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md).

### Corporate Sector

Companies use CAPM in their [capital budgeting](../c/capital_budgeting.md) processes to evaluate investment projects. For instance, a [firm](../f/firm.md) like General Electric might use CAPM to estimate the required [return](../r/return.md) on a new project and compare it with its [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), helping decide whether to proceed with the investment.

### Government Agencies

Regulatory bodies and government agencies may use CAPM to set benchmarks for acceptable returns on investments and regulatory assessments. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may refer to CAPM in evaluating the fairness of proposed returns in investment products.

## Conclusion

The [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model remains one of the most pivotal concepts in modern [finance](../f/finance.md) despite its limitations and criticisms. It provides a simple, yet powerful framework for understanding the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md), making it an invaluable tool for investors, portfolio managers, [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) professionals, and regulators. As extensions and alternative models like APT and the Fama-French model continue to evolve, they build upon the foundational ideas of CAPM, enhancing our understanding of [asset](../a/asset.md) pricing in increasingly complex [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
