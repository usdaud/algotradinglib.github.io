# Candlestick Patterns

[Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) patterns are a form of chart analysis used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), particularly for trading [stocks](../s/stock.md), forex, and other securities. These patterns provide traders with insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and potential future price movements by illustrating the forces of [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) through [price action](../p/price_action.md).

## History and Origin
The concept of [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) patterns originated from 18th-century Japan, developed by rice [trader](../t/trader.md) Munehisa Homma. He created a method to graphically represent price movements, which has evolved into what we now recognize as [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) charts. Western [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) adopted this approach in the late 20th century, popularized by traders such as Steve Nison.

## Structure of a Candlestick
A single [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) provides crucial information about the [price action](../p/price_action.md) within a specific time frame (e.g., a minute, hour, day). Each [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) consists of four main components:
1. **[Open](../o/open.md)**: The initial price at which the [asset](../a/asset.md) is traded within the time frame.
2. **Close**: The final price at which the [asset](../a/asset.md) is traded within the time frame.
3. **High**: The highest price reached within the time frame.
4. **Low**: The lowest price reached within the time frame.
   
The body of the [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) represents the [range](../r/range.md) between the [open](../o/open.md) and close prices. If the close price is higher than the [open](../o/open.md), the [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) is usually colored green or white (bullish). If the close price is lower than the [open](../o/open.md), the [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) is typically colored red or black (bearish). The lines extending from the body are called shadows or wicks, indicating the high and low prices during the trading period.

## Types of Candlestick Patterns
[Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) patterns can be categorized into single, double, or [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) patterns based on the number of candles involved.

### Single Candlestick Patterns
Single [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) patterns derive their significance from the shape and size of a single candle.

#### Doji
A [Doji](../d/doji.md) occurs when the [open](../o/open.md) and close prices are almost equal, often signaling indecision in the [market](../m/market.md). Variants include:
- **[Gravestone Doji](../g/gravestone_doji.md)**: Forms when the [open](../o/open.md), close, and low prices are approximately the same, and a long upper wick indicates a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md).
- **Dragonfly [Doji](../d/doji.md)**: Forms when the [open](../o/open.md), close, and high prices are approximately the same, with a long lower wick.
- **[Long-legged Doji](../l/long-legged_doji.md)**: Demonstrates high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) with long upper and lower wicks.

#### Hammer and Hanging Man
Both patterns have small bodies and long lower wicks:
- **Hammer**: Appears at the end of a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), indicating potential bullish [reversal](../r/reversal.md).
- **Hanging Man**: Appears at the end of an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), indicating potential bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

#### Inverted Hammer and Shooting Star
Both patterns have small bodies and long upper wicks:
- **Inverted Hammer**: Appears at the end of a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), suggesting a bullish [reversal](../r/reversal.md).
- **[Shooting Star](../s/shooting_star.md)**: Appears at the end of an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), suggesting a bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

### Double Candlestick Patterns
Double [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) patterns involve two candles, focusing on the relationship between them.

#### Bullish and Bearish Engulfing
- **Bullish Engulfing**: A small bearish candle followed by a larger bullish candle that fully engulfs the previous one. It suggests a potential upward [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **Bearish Engulfing**: A small bullish candle followed by a larger bearish candle that fully engulfs the previous one. It indicates a potential downward [trend](../t/trend.md).

#### Tweezer Tops and Bottoms
- **[Tweezer](../t/tweezer.md) Tops**: Two candles with similar highs, indicative of resistance and potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) from an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).
- **[Tweezer](../t/tweezer.md) Bottoms**: Two candles with similar lows, indicative of support and potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) from a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

### Three or More Candlestick Patterns
Complex patterns consist of three or more candles, providing a more comprehensive view of [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

#### Morning and Evening Star
- **[Morning Star](../m/morning_star.md)**: A three-candle pattern where a bearish candle is followed by a small-bodied candle (indecision or [trend](../t/trend.md) change), and then a bullish candle, indicating a potential upward [reversal](../r/reversal.md).
- **[Evening Star](../e/evening_star.md)**: A three-candle pattern where a bullish candle is followed by a small-bodied candle, then a bearish candle, indicating a potential downward [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

#### Three Black Crows and Three White Soldiers
- **[Three Black Crows](../t/three_black_crows.md)**: A bearish pattern with three consecutive long bearish candles, indicating a strong bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **Three White Soldiers**: A bullish pattern with three consecutive long bullish candles, suggesting a strong bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).

## Using Candlestick Patterns in Trading
[Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) patterns are employed to identify potential trading opportunities and enhance decision-making. However, they should not be used in isolation; traders often combine them with other [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tools like moving averages, [trend](../t/trend.md) lines, and oscillators to confirm the signals.

### Pattern Identification
Successful identification of patterns requires familiarity and practice. Software and algorithmic tools can assist traders by automatically detecting patterns and signaling potential trades.

### Risk Management
Even when patterns are identified correctly, the [market](../m/market.md) may not always move as expected. Proper [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies, such as setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) and [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), are crucial to mitigate potential losses.

## Technology and Algorithmic Trading
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as algo trading or automated trading, leverages computer algorithms to execute trades at high speed and [volume](../v/volume.md) based on predefined criteria, including [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) patterns.

### Machine Learning and AI
Modern advancements in machine learning (ML) and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) (AI) have enabled the creation of sophisticated models that can recognize complex patterns and predict [market](../m/market.md) movements with high accuracy.

### Pattern Recognition Software
Many trading platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) built-in [pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) tools that automatically highlight [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) patterns on charts:
