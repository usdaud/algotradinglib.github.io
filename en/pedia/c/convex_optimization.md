# Convex Optimization

### Introduction to Convex Optimization

Convex [optimization](../o/optimization.md) is a subfield of mathematical [optimization](../o/optimization.md) that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. The central theme in convex [optimization](../o/optimization.md) is ensuring that the objective function and the constraints form a convex set, which means any local minimum [will](../w/will.md) also be a global minimum. This property significantly simplifies the problem and makes it tractable using efficient algorithms.

### Fundamentals of Convex Sets and Functions

**Convex Sets**:
A set \( C \) in a vector space is convex if, for all \( x, y \in C \), the line segment connecting \( x \) and \( y \) is entirely contained within \( C \). Formally:
\[ \forall \, \[theta](../t/theta.md) \in [0,1], \, \[theta](../t/theta.md) x + (1 - \[theta](../t/theta.md)) y \in C. \]

**Convex Functions**:
A function \( f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is convex if its domain is a convex set and for all \( x, y \) in its domain and \( \[theta](../t/theta.md) \in [0,1] \), the following inequality holds:
\[ f(\[theta](../t/theta.md) x + (1 - \[theta](../t/theta.md)) y) \leq \[theta](../t/theta.md) f(x) + (1 - \[theta](../t/theta.md)) f(y). \]

### Properties and Characteristics

**Basic Properties**:
1. The sum of convex functions is convex.
2. The pointwise maximum of convex functions is convex.
3. Affine functions are convex.

**Support Functions**:
Convex functions can be characterized by their supporting hyperplanes, which are linear functionals that "touch" the function from below. This geometric interpretation is vital in [optimization](../o/optimization.md) algorithms where the objective is to minimize the function.

### Optimization Algorithms and Techniques

Several algorithms are specifically designed to solve convex [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems efficiently:

**Gradient Descent**:
An iterative approach for finding the local minimum of a function by moving in the direction of the negative gradient. For convex functions, gradient descent guarantees convergence to the global minimum.

**Newton's Method**:
A second-[order](../o/order.md) [optimization](../o/optimization.md) technique that uses the Hessian matrix to adjust the steps. While it converges faster than gradient descent, it requires the computation of second-[order](../o/order.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), which can be computationally intensive.

**Interior-Point Methods**:
These methods solve a sequence of approximations to the original problem by working within the interior of the feasible region. Interior-point methods are highly efficient for large-scale convex [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems.

**Subgradient Methods**:
These are generalizations of gradient methods, applicable even when the function is not differentiable. Subgradient methods are useful in cases where the objective function has kinks or discontinuities.

**Primal-Dual Methods**:
These approaches solve both the primal and dual problems concurrently, providing improved convergence properties and robustness, especially for large-scale problems.

### Convex Optimization in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) relies heavily on [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and computational techniques to make optimal trading decisions. Convex [optimization](../o/optimization.md) plays a crucial role in several aspects of trading, including:

**[Portfolio Optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md)**:
The classic [mean-variance optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md) problem, introduced by [Harry Markowitz](../h/harry_markowitz.md), is fundamentally a convex [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problem. The aim is to find a portfolio that minimizes [risk](../r/risk.md) (variance) for a given [expected return](../e/expected_return.md).

\[ \min_{w} \frac{1}{2} w^T \Sigma w - \[lambda](../l/lambda.md) \mu^T w \]
subject to \( w \geq 0 \) and \( \sum w_i = 1 \), where \( \Sigma \) is the [covariance](../c/covariance.md) matrix of [asset](../a/asset.md) returns, \( \mu \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) vector, and \( \[lambda](../l/lambda.md) \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md) aversion parameter.

**[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**:
Convex [optimization](../o/optimization.md) helps in minimizing various [risk measures](../r/risk_measures.md) such as [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR) and Conditional [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (CVaR). These measures are crucial for determining the potential losses in a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

**Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**:
Traders use statistical models to identify and exploit mispricings between related financial instruments. Optimizing these models often involves solving convex [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems to balance the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md).

### Tools and Software for Convex Optimization

**Stochastic Programming**:
This deals with [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems that involve randomness. Stochastic programming models [decision-making under uncertainty](../d/decision-making_under_uncertainty.md), where some of the constraints or coefficients are [random variables](../r/random_variables.md) with known distributions.

**Semidefinite Programming (SDP)**:
A powerful generalization of [linear programming](../l/linear_programming_in_trading.md), SDP optimizes a linear objective function subject to the constraint that an affine combination of symmetric matrices is positive semidefinite.
