# Common Stock

Common stock, also known as common [shares](../s/shares.md), is a type of [equity](../e/equity.md) ownership in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md). Common stockholders are typically entitled to vote on corporate matters, such as electing directors or approving major corporate policies. These stockholders are also eligible to receive dividends, which are a portion of the company's profits distributed to shareholders. However, these dividends are not guaranteed and can vary greatly depending on the company's profitability and other factors.

Common stock is the most prevalent form of stock that companies [issue](../i/issue.md) and is a major component of the [equity](../e/equity.md) portion of the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). It represents residual ownership in the company, which means that in the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), common shareholders are paid after [debt](../d/debt.md) holders and preferred shareholders.

## Characteristics of Common Stock

1. **Voting Rights**: Common stockholders often receive one vote per share to elect board members who oversee the major decisions made by management. This can include decisions like mergers and acquisitions, issuance of additional stock, or major policy changes.

2. **Dividends**: While common stockholders can receive dividends, these payouts are not guaranteed. Dividends are usually declared by the Board of Directors, and the frequency and amount can fluctuate based on the company's profitability and other strategic considerations.

3. **Residual Claim**: In the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), common stockholders have a claim on the residual assets of the company after all debts and other [obligations](../o/obligation.md) are paid. This makes common stock riskier than [debt](../d/debt.md) or [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md), but it also offers greater potential rewards.

4. **[Market Value](../m/market_value.md)**: The [market price](../m/market_price.md) of common stock can be volatile, influenced by the company's performance, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment, and various economic factors.

5. **[Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md)**: Common stockholders have [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md), meaning they can lose their investment, but they are not personally liable for the company’s debts.

## Types of Common Stock

Most companies [issue](../i/issue.md) one class of common stock, but some companies may [issue](../i/issue.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) classes with different voting rights or other features. For instance:

1. **Class A [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: These are typically the common stock [shares](../s/shares.md) that have voting rights and are publicly traded.

2. **Class B [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: These might have fewer voting rights (or none at all) but might come with other privileges such as higher [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts.

Companies [issue](../i/issue.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) classes to retain control over certain decisions while still enabling broad ownership.

## Issuance of Common Stock

Companies [issue](../i/issue.md) common stock as a way to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). This can occur in several ways:

1. **Initial Public [Offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO)**: The first time a company offers its [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public. This can help the company raise a significant amount of [capital](../c/capital.md).

2. **Secondary Offerings**: Additional [shares](../s/shares.md) offered to the public after the IPO. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including raising more [capital](../c/capital.md) for [expansion](../e/expansion.md), paying down [debt](../d/debt.md), or even for existing shareholders to cash out part of their [holdings](../h/holdings.md).

The funds raised from these issuances are generally used for [business](../b/business.md) growth, research and development, or other strategic initiatives.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Appreciation**: Common stockholders can benefit from the appreciation in the stock price. If the company performs well, the [value](../v/value.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) can increase, providing substantial returns.

2. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Income](../i/income.md)**: When the company is profitable, shareholders can receive dividends, providing a stream of [income](../i/income.md).

3. **Voting Rights**: Shareholders can influence [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and major [business](../b/business.md) decisions through their voting rights.

4. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Common [stocks](../s/stock.md) are usually traded on public exchanges, providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to shareholders.

### Disadvantages

1. **High [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: If the company performs poorly, the stock price can fall drastically, leading to losses.

2. **Residual Claim**: Common shareholders are the last to be paid in the event of dissolution. This means they may receive nothing if debts and other [obligations](../o/obligation.md) exhaust the company’s assets.

3. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Variation**: Unlike bonds, dividends on common stock can be irregular and are not guaranteed.

4. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: The prices of common [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be highly volatile, influenced by [market](../m/market.md) conditions, news, and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment.

## Role in Portfolio Management

Common stock plays a significant role in diversified investment portfolios. Due to its potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation, an allocation in common stock can provide higher returns over the long term compared to more conservative investments like bonds. However, this comes with greater [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Strategies for Investing in Common Stock

1. **[Growth Investing](../g/growth_investing.md)**: Focuses on companies expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies. This often involves [investing](../i/investing.md) in technology [stocks](../s/stock.md) or emerging markets.

2. **[Value Investing](../v/value_investing.md)**: Involves picking [stocks](../s/stock.md) that appear to be underpriced relative to their [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md). This strategy seeks to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies.

3. **[Income](../i/income.md) [Investing](../i/investing.md)**: Targets [stocks](../s/stock.md) that provide a reliable stream of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [income](../i/income.md). This is often suitable for retirees or those seeking steady [income](../i/income.md).

4. **[Index Investing](../i/index_investing.md)**: Involves replicating the performance of a stock [index](../i/index_instrument.md), such as the S&P 500. This provides broad [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md) and [diversification](../d/diversification.md), lowering [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Common Stock and Algo Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algo trading, involves using automated, pre-programmed trading instructions to execute orders. These algorithms can be designed to consider a myriad of factors, from time, price, [volume](../v/volume.md), to complex [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and insights derived from various data sources. When it comes to common stock, algo trading offers several benefits:

1. **Speed**: Algorithms can process and execute trades much faster than human traders, making it possible to take advantage of minute [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies.

2. **Consistency**: Algo trading eliminates human emotions such as fear and greed that can lead to inconsistent trading decisions.

3. **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Algorithms can monitor [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets and securities simultaneously, ensuring that trading opportunities are not missed.

4. **Complex Strategies**: Algorithms can be designed to execute complex [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that would be impossible for human traders to execute manually.

### Examples of Algo Trading Strategies for Common Stock

1. **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md)**: Uses moving averages and other indicators to identify and follow [market](../m/market.md) trends. When the stock price is trending upwards, the algorithm [will](../w/will.md) buy, and when it trends downwards, it [will](../w/will.md) sell.

2. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Assumes that stock prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical mean. The algorithm buys [stocks](../s/stock.md) that are considered [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) and sells those that are [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md).

3. **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Looks for statistical correlations between various securities to identify mispriced [stocks](../s/stock.md) and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on them.

4. **[Market](../m/market.md) Making**: Involves placing both buy and sell orders to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md).

5. **News-Based Trading**: Analyzes news articles, [social media](../s/social_media.md) mentions, and other sources of information to make trading decisions in real-time.
