# Collusion

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), frequently referred to as algo trading, involves the use of complex algorithms to make trading decisions in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These algorithms can execute orders, manage [risk](../r/risk.md), and analyze [market](../m/market.md) data at speeds and frequencies impractical for human traders. With the increased reliance on such technology, however, comes a dark sideâ€”collusion. Collusion in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) refers to the illicit cooperation between [market](../m/market.md) participants to manipulate the [market](../m/market.md) to their advantage. This practice is illegal and can have dire consequences for [market](../m/market.md) integrity, [investor](../i/investor.md) [trust](../t/trust.md), and the overall stability of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## What is Collusion?

Collusion is the act of two or more parties working together secretly to deceive others, particularly to create an unfair advantage in a [market](../m/market.md) or a competitive setting. This deceit can take numerous forms, such as price-fixing, [bid](../b/bid.md)-rigging, or [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md). In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), collusion is particularly insidious as it can occur at a scale and speed that makes detection difficult. 

## Forms of Collusion in Algorithmic Trading

### 1. Price-Fixing

Price-fixing occurs when competitors agree on pricing strategies instead of letting [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) set prices. In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), this could involve trading bots programmed to maintain prices at artificially high or low levels. 

### 2. Bid-Rigging

[Bid](../b/bid.md)-rigging often involves competitors agreeing in advance who [will](../w/will.md) win a [bid](../b/bid.md), allowing one to win the contract while giving the appearance of a competitive process. In algo trading, this can be executed at lightning speeds across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) exchanges.

### 3. Market Manipulation

[Market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) is the act of artificially affecting the [supply](../s/supply.md) or [demand](../d/demand.md) for a [security](../s/security.md), thereby moving its price in a desired direction. Algorithms can be designed to create [false market signals](../f/false_market_signals.md) through techniques like [spoofing](../s/spoofing.md), layering, or [front-running](../f/front-running.md).

#### Spoofing and Layering

- **[Spoofing](../s/spoofing.md)**: [Spoofing](../s/spoofing.md) involves placing fake orders to create the illusion of [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md). These orders are then quickly canceled once the [market](../m/market.md) moves in the desired direction.
- **Layering**: Similar to [spoofing](../s/spoofing.md), layering involves placing [multiple](../m/multiple.md) fake orders at different price levels to deceive other traders about the [market depth](../m/market_depth.md) and direction.

#### Front-Running

[Front-running](../f/front-running.md) is the unethical practice of executing orders based on advance knowledge of pending orders. For instance, if an algorithm detects a large buy [order](../o/order.md), it could execute its own purchase first, thereby profiting from the price increase.

## Key Players Involved in Collusion

Collusion in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) can involve a variety of [market](../m/market.md) participants, including:

- **[Broker](../b/broker.md)-Dealers**: These intermediaries can collude to manipulate [market](../m/market.md) prices and charge higher commissions.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Makers**: They can engage in price-fixing and other forms of collusion to stabilize prices at desired levels.
- **Institutional Investors**: Large-scale traders might coordinate trades to impact [market](../m/market.md) prices.

## Real-World Examples of Collusion Cases

### 1. The Libor Scandal

The London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) scandal involved major financial institutions colluding to manipulate the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) used worldwide. Banks like Barclays and [UBS](../u/ubs.md) manipulated the rate for [profit](../p/profit.md), impacting trillions in financial instruments.

### 2. Foreign Exchange Market Manipulation

In 2013, several major banks were investigated and fined for colluding to manipulate [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) rates. Traders used private chat rooms to discuss and set prices for specific currencies. 

For example, JPMorgan Chase (https://www.jpmorganchase.com) and Citigroup (https://www.citigroup.com) were among the institutions fined for their involvement.

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

### Antitrust Laws

[Antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) laws aim to prevent anti-competitive practices, including collusion. In the U.S., the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act are key legislative measures against collusion.

The Sherman Act:
- Prohibits explicit collusion and conspiracy to restrain [trade](../t/trade.md).
  
The Clayton Act:
- Addresses specific practices that the Sherman Act does not specifically prohibit.

### Regulatory Bodies

Numerous regulatory bodies across the globe oversee and regulate trading practices to prevent collusion. Notable organizations include:

- **The Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC)**: The SEC regulates securities markets in the United States and enforces laws against [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) (https://www.sec.gov).
- **The [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC)**: The CFTC oversees [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) markets and imposes sanctions for collusion and [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) (https://www.cftc.gov).

### Technical Solutions for Detection

Given the speed and complexity of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), technical solutions are essential for detecting collusion:

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Surveillance Systems**: Advanced [software platforms](../s/software_platforms_for_trading.md) can analyze trading patterns in real-time, identifying anomalies indicative of collusion.
- **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and AI**: Algorithms can use [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models to detect suspicious trading activities by identifying patterns that defy typical [market](../m/market.md) behavior.
  
## Ethical Considerations

Collusion in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) not only breaks laws but also erodes the ethical foundations of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). [Trust](../t/trust.md) and fairness are critical for the functioning of markets, and collusion undermines these principles. Companies have ethical [obligations](../o/obligation.md) to ensure their [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) do not engage in collusive behaviors.

## Industry Best Practices

### Internal Audits

Firms can conduct internal audits to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Independent audits can also provide unbiased assessments of trading practices.

### Whistleblower Programs

Encouraging employees to report unethical behavior can help detect and prevent collusion. Protection and incentives for whistleblowers are essential for these programs to be effective.

### Transparency and Reporting

Increased [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in [trade](../t/trade.md) reporting can help detect and prevent collusion. Real-time reporting and public disclosures enhance the ability to identify suspicious activities.

## Conclusion

Collusion in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) poses significant risks to [market](../m/market.md) integrity, [investor](../i/investor.md) [trust](../t/trust.md), and legal compliance. As automation and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) continue to grow, so does the potential for illicit activities like collusion. Legal and regulatory frameworks, combined with technological solutions and ethical vigilance, are essential to combat this threat. Major financial institutions and regulatory bodies must work in coordination to detect, prevent, and penalize collusive practices in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).
