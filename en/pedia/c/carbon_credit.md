# Carbon Credit

Carbon [credit](../c/credit.md), often interchangeably referred to as a carbon [offset](../o/offset.md), is an innovative and crucial financial tool designed to help mitigate the effects of global climate change. These credits represent a permit or certificate that allows an entity, usually a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) or government, to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide or an equivalent amount of another greenhouse gas (GHG). The primary purpose of carbon credits is to incentivize reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on allowable emissions and enabling a [market](../m/market.md)-driven approach for reducing them.

Carbon credits primarily operate under two systems: cap-and-[trade](../t/trade.md) and voluntary [offset](../o/offset.md) programs.

## Cap-and-Trade Systems

### Emission Trading Schemes (ETS)

Cap-and-[trade](../t/trade.md) systems, also known as Emission Trading Schemes (ETS), are regulatory frameworks that aim to reduce pollution by set limits on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted. Governments or international bodies set a cap on the amount of emissions for specific sectors or regions. Companies or organizations receive or buy permits to emit a certain amount. If they exceed their limit, they must purchase additional permits from others who have excess.

The [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is one of the largest and most established cap-and-[trade](../t/trade.md) systems globally. Launched in 2005, the EU ETS covers more than 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 30 countries.

### Carbon Pricing Mechanisms

Some regions implement carbon pricing mechanisms, including [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on carbon emissions incorporating [offset](../o/offset.md) trading practices. These systems place a financial penalty on emissions, encouraging businesses to opt for cleaner alternatives. The resultant [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is often reinvested in renewable energy projects or returned to the public through rebates or subsidies.

## Voluntary Carbon Markets

Apart from regulated markets, there are voluntary carbon markets where companies and individuals willingly purchase carbon credits to [offset](../o/offset.md) their own emissions. This involves funding projects that reduce or sequester GHG emissions, such as renewable energy projects, forestry initiatives, and methane capture endeavors.

### Major Voluntary Carbon Standards:
1. **Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)**: One of the most widely used voluntary carbon [offset](../o/offset.md) standards globally. Administered by Verra, VCS verifies and accredits carbon [offset](../o/offset.md) projects that meet rigorous criteria.
 For more information: Verra - VCS

2. **[Gold Standard](../g/gold_standard.md)**: Known for its stringent environmental and social safeguards, it ensures projects not only reduce carbon emissions but also contribute to sustainable development goals.
 For more information: Gold Standard

3. **American Carbon Registry (ACR)**: An early voluntary carbon [offset](../o/offset.md) program in the U.S., ACR sets high standards for project quality and rigor.

4. **Climate Action Reserve (CAR)**: Focuses on North American projects and emphasizes [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability.

## Types of Carbon Offset Projects

### Renewable Energy Projects

These projects focus on generating energy from renewable sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, and hydroelectric power. By displacing the need for fossil-fuel-based energy generation, these projects significantly reduce GHG emissions.

### Forestry Projects

Forestry projects can contribute to carbon sequestration by planting trees, protecting existing forests, and enhancing forest management practices to increase carbon absorption. Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is a well-known forestry endeavor.

### Methane Capture Projects

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and initiatives that capture methane from landfills, agriculture, or industrial sources can significantly mitigate GHG emissions. For example, methane capture at landfills involves trapping and converting methane gas into energy.

### Energy Efficiency Projects

Energy [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) projects reduce the energy required to carry out various processes, thereby reducing the associated carbon emissions. Examples include upgrading industrial equipment, retrofitting buildings, and improving public transportation systems.

## Market Dynamics and Challenges

### Pricing Volatility

The price of carbon credits can be highly volatile, influenced by regulatory changes, [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md), and economic factors. This [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can pose challenges for long-term investment planning in carbon reduction projects.

### Additionality and Verification

Ensuring that carbon [offset](../o/offset.md) projects represent genuine, additional reductions in emissions (additionality) is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the carbon [market](../m/market.md). Verification and certification standards play a key role in this aspect but can also introduce complexity and cost.

### Market Access and Equity

Access to carbon markets can be uneven, with smaller or less developed countries and projects facing [barriers to entry](../b/barriers_to_entry.md). Ensuring that these markets are inclusive and equitable remains an ongoing challenge.

## Future Perspectives

As the world increasingly recognizes the urgency of addressing climate change, the role of carbon credits in global mitigation efforts is likely to expand. Innovations in [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology, for example, [hold](../h/hold.md) promise for enhancing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and traceability in carbon trading.

Global cooperation and alignment on standards and regulations, such as those being negotiated under the Paris Agreement, [will](../w/will.md) be crucial for fostering a unified and effective carbon [market](../m/market.md).

## Key Players

### Corporates and Industrial Giants

Several corporations are heavily invested in carbon credits, both as buyers to [offset](../o/offset.md) their own emissions and as developers of projects that generate credits.

- **Microsoft**: Has committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030, [investing](../i/investing.md) in various carbon removal projects.

In summary, carbon credits represent a pivotal mechanism in the global fight against climate change. While there are challenges and complexities involved, they [offer](../o/offer.md) a pathway to incentivize and [finance](../f/finance.md) meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. With continued innovation and collaboration, the potential of carbon credits to contribute significantly to a sustainable future is immense.
