# Common Size Financial Statement

Common size [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) are a form of [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) that expresses each line item on a financial statement as a percentage of a selected figure. This methodology helps investors, analysts, and managers to understand the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) of a company by eliminating the effects of size, making it easier to compare with other firms or look at trends over time. By converting raw numbers into percentages, common size analysis makes it easier to see changes in financial statement line items. This is incredibly useful for benchmarking and [trend analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md).

## Income Statement

A [common size income statement](../c/common_size_income_statement.md) expresses each item as a percentage of total sales. The formula for each line item is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Common Size Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Line Item}}{\text{Total Sales}} \right) \times 100 \]

### Example

Consider the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) of an imaginary company, XYZ [Corporation](../c/corporation.md):

| Item | Amount |
|--------------------------|---------|
| Total Sales | $1,000,000 |
| Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)| $400,000 |
| [Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md) | $600,000 |
| Operating Expenses | $200,000 |
| [Operating Income](../o/operating_income.md) | $400,000 |
| [Interest Expense](../i/interest_expense.md) | $50,000 |
| [Income](../i/income.md) Before Tax | $350,000 |
| [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) | $105,000 |
| Net [Income](../i/income.md) | $245,000 |

The [common size income statement](../c/common_size_income_statement.md) would be:

| Item | Amount | Common Size (%) |
|--------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Total Sales | $1,000,000 | 100% |
| Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)| $400,000 | 40% |
| [Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md) | $600,000 | 60% |
| Operating Expenses | $200,000 | 20% |
| [Operating Income](../o/operating_income.md) | $400,000 | 40% |
| [Interest Expense](../i/interest_expense.md) | $50,000 | 5% |
| [Income](../i/income.md) Before Tax | $350,000 | 35% |
| [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) | $105,000 | 10.5% |
| Net [Income](../i/income.md) | $245,000 | 24.5% |

## Balance Sheet

A common size [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) expresses each item as a percentage of total assets. The formula for each line item is:

\[ \text{Common Size Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Line Item}}{\text{Total Assets}} \right) \times 100 \]

### Example

Consider the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) of an imaginary company, XYZ [Corporation](../c/corporation.md):

| [Asset](../a/asset.md) | Amount |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Cash and [Cash Equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md) | $150,000 |
| Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md) | $200,000 |
| [Inventory](../i/inventory.md) | $300,000 |
| Property, Plant, and Equipment | $350,000 |
| Total Assets | $1,000,000 |

| Liabilities and [Equity](../e/equity.md) | Amount |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Accounts Payable | $100,000 |
| [Short-Term Debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) | $50,000 |
| [Long-Term Debt](../l/long-term_debt.md) | $200,000 |
| [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) | $350,000 |
| Total [Equity](../e/equity.md) | $650,000 |
| [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) and [Equity](../e/equity.md) | $1,000,000 |

The common size [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) would be:

| [Asset](../a/asset.md) | Amount | Common Size (%) |
|----------------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Cash and [Cash Equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md) | $150,000 | 15% |
| Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md) | $200,000 | 20% |
| [Inventory](../i/inventory.md) | $300,000 | 30% |
| Property, Plant, and Equipment | $350,000 | 35% |
| Total Assets | $1,000,000 | 100% |

| Liabilities and [Equity](../e/equity.md) | Amount | Common Size (%) |
|----------------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Accounts Payable | $100,000 | 10% |
| [Short-Term Debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) | $50,000 | 5% |
| [Long-Term Debt](../l/long-term_debt.md) | $200,000 | 20% |
| [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) | $350,000 | 35% |
| Total [Equity](../e/equity.md) | $650,000 | 65% |
| [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) and [Equity](../e/equity.md) | $1,000,000 | 100% |

## Cash Flow Statement

A common size [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md) expresses each item as a percentage of total cash inflows. The formula for each line item is:

\[ \text{Common Size Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Line Item}}{\text{Total Cash Inflows}} \right) \times 100 \]

### Example

Consider the [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md) of an imaginary company, XYZ [Corporation](../c/corporation.md):

| Item | Amount |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| [Net Cash](../n/net_cash.md) from [Operating Activities](../o/operating_activities.md) | $300,000 |
| [Net Cash](../n/net_cash.md) from [Investing](../i/investing.md) Activities | -$100,000|
| [Net Cash](../n/net_cash.md) from [Financing](../f/financing.md) Activities | $50,000 |
| Total Cash Inflows | $250,000 |

The common size [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md) would be:

| Item | Amount | Common Size (%) |
|---------------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| [Net Cash](../n/net_cash.md) from [Operating Activities](../o/operating_activities.md) | $300,000 | 120% |
| [Net Cash](../n/net_cash.md) from [Investing](../i/investing.md) Activities | -$100,000| -40% |
| [Net Cash](../n/net_cash.md) from [Financing](../f/financing.md) Activities | $50,000 | 20% |
| Total Cash Inflows | $250,000 | 100% |

[Note](../n/note.md): The percentages here can exceed 100% or be negative due to the nature of [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) dynamics.

## Benefits of Common Size Financial Statements

### Easier Comparison

One of the main advantages of common size [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) is that they make it easier to compare companies of different sizes, as well as to analyze the [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) of a company over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) periods.

### Trend Analysis

By converting [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) into common size format, [trend analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md) becomes straightforward. Analysts can quickly discern whether certain areas such as cost of goods sold, liabilities, or [revenue](../r/revenue.md) are increasing or decreasing over time.

### Highlighting Changes

Common size statements help in highlighting significant changes that may need management’s attention. For instance, a rising percentage of COGS relative to sales could indicate inefficiencies or increased raw material costs.

### Benchmarking Against Industry Standards

Common size [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) allow for easy benchmarking against [industry](../i/industry.md) standards or direct competitors. This comparison can reveal whether a company has higher expenses, [revenue](../r/revenue.md), or other line items relative to its peers.

## Limitations of Common Size Financial Statements

### Limited Information on Absolute Size

While this method standardizes financial data, it doesn't provide information on the absolute size of the figures. Two companies might both show a 20% [operating margin](../o/operating_margin.md), but if one has significantly higher revenues, the absolute figure matters for deeper analysis.

### Doesn't Address Quality of Earnings

Common size [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) don't provide insights into the [quality of earnings](../q/quality_of_earnings.md). A company might show a high percentage of net [income](../i/income.md), but this could be due to non-recurring gains or aggressive [accounting](../a/accounting.md) practices.

### Ignores External Factors

This analysis method doesn't consider external economic factors that might influence the percentages. Fluctuations in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates, or changes in [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) could impact the common size percentages but [will](../w/will.md) not be transparent from the statements themselves.

## Practical Applications

### Equity Analysts

[Equity](../e/equity.md) analysts use common size statements to compare firms within the same [industry](../i/industry.md) or friends operating in different sectors. This helps in understanding which companies are more efficient or profitable.

### Management

Management teams utilize these statements for internal performance reviews. By regularly converting their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) to common size format, they can pinpoint operational inefficiencies or areas where they are overspending.

### Lenders and Investors

Lenders and investors use common size [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) to assess a company's [risk](../r/risk.md) and potential returns. These tools are crucial for making informed funding or investment decisions.

### Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A)

FP&A professionals use common size [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) for budgeting and [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md). These percentages serve as a [baseline](../b/baseline.md) to project future [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) based on historical trends.

## Software and Tools for Common Size Financial Statements

### Microsoft Excel

Excel is still one of the most commonly used tools for creating common size [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). It allows for customization and can easily [handle](../h/handle.md) complex computations and graphical presentations.

### Financial Analysis Software

There are numerous [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) software packages available that automate the creation of common size [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). Examples include:

- **QuickBooks**: QuickBooks
- **SAP**: SAP
- **Oracle Financials**: Oracle Financials

These tools often come with pre-built templates and integration capabilities that make the process seamless and efficient.

### Online Platforms

Several online [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) features for generating common size [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), including:

- **Koyfin**: Koyfin
- **[Yahoo Finance](../y/yahoo_finance.md)**: Yahoo Finance

These platforms often include additional features like real-time data, [trend analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md), and peer comparison, making them very useful for both professional analysts and individual investors.
