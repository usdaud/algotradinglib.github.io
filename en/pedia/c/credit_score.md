# Credit Score

## Introduction

A [credit](../c/credit.md) score is a numerical representation of a person's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md), which is used by lenders to evaluate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of lending [money](../m/money.md) to a borrower. This individual score significantly impacts one’s ability to obtain loans, [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, and even influence rental agreements and job opportunities. The better the [credit](../c/credit.md) score, the more likely an individual is to be approved for [credit](../c/credit.md) or loans with favorable terms.

## How Is a Credit Score Calculated?

[Credit](../c/credit.md) scores are calculated using various models, the most common being the [FICO score](../f/fico_score.md) and the [VantageScore](../v/vantagescore.md). Each uses a [range](../r/range.md) of data points extracted from a person's [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) to produce a score, typically between 300 and 850.

### FICO Score

The [FICO score](../f/fico_score.md) is one of the most widely used [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models in the United States. The algorithm examines the following factors:

1. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) History (35%)**: Timeliness of bill payments, any missed or late payments.
2. **Amounts Owed (30%)**: The total amount of [credit](../c/credit.md) and loans in use, and how much of the available [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md) is being utilized.
3. **Length of [Credit](../c/credit.md) History (15%)**: The age of your accounts, including the oldest account and the average age of all accounts.
4. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Mix (10%)**: The assortment of [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts such as [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, retail accounts, installment loans, and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans.
5. **New [Credit](../c/credit.md) (10%)**: The number of recently opened accounts and recent inquiries into your [credit report](../c/credit_report.md).

### VantageScore

[VantageScore](../v/vantagescore.md), created by the three major [credit](../c/credit.md) bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion), employs similar data but divvies up the weighting slightly differently:

1. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) History (40%)**: Again, on-time payments are crucial.
2. **Depth of [Credit](../c/credit.md) (21%)**: Emphasizes the different types of [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts and their [duration](../d/duration.md).
3. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Utilization (20%)**: Measures how much [credit](../c/credit.md) is used compared to the total available limit.
4. **Balancing of [Debt](../d/debt.md) (11%)**: Considers the amounts of recent [debt](../d/debt.md) against old [debt](../d/debt.md).
5. **Recent [Credit](../c/credit.md) (5%)**: Includes newly opened [credit](../c/credit.md) lines and inquiries.
6. **Available [Credit](../c/credit.md) (3%)**: Assesses how much [credit](../c/credit.md) is available but not being used.

## Importance of a Credit Score

A [credit](../c/credit.md) score has numerous implications for an individual’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md):

1. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Approvals**: Higher [credit](../c/credit.md) scores usually mean better chances of [loan](../l/loan.md) approval.
2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Higher [credit](../c/credit.md) scores can lead to lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, saving borrowers [money](../m/money.md) over the life of a [loan](../l/loan.md).
3. **[Credit Card](../c/credit_card.md) Approvals**: [Credit](../c/credit.md) scores are crucial for obtaining [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, particularly those with rewards and benefits.
4. **Employment Opportunities**: Some employers review [credit](../c/credit.md) scores during the hiring process, associating financial responsibility with job reliability.
5. **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Premiums**: Many [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies use [credit](../c/credit.md) scores to set [premium](../p/premium.md) rates, particularly for [home](../h/home.md) and auto [insurance](../i/insurance.md).
6. **Rental Agreements**: Landlords often [check](../c/check.md) [credit](../c/credit.md) scores to assess potential tenants, seeing higher scores as indicative of reliable rent payments.

## Factors Impacting a Credit Score

A variety of factors can impact your [credit](../c/credit.md) score either positively or negatively.

### Positive Factors

1. **Timely Payments**: Consistency in making payments on or before due dates.
2. **Low [Credit](../c/credit.md) Utilization**: Using less than 30% of your available [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md).
3. **Long [Credit](../c/credit.md) History**: Keeping older accounts [open](../o/open.md) and active.
4. **Diverse [Credit](../c/credit.md) Mix**: Managing different types of [credit](../c/credit.md) responsibly.
5. **Limited Inquiries**: Minimizing the number of hard pulls on your [credit report](../c/credit_report.md).

### Negative Factors

1. **Late Payments**: Paying bills late or missing payments can significantly affect your score.
2. **High [Credit](../c/credit.md) Utilization**: Using a high percentage of your available [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md) can be detrimental.
3. **Short [Credit](../c/credit.md) History**: Closing old accounts can decrease the average age of your [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts.
4. **Few Types of [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: Relying too heavily on one type of [credit](../c/credit.md) can be limiting.
5. **Numerous [Credit](../c/credit.md) Inquiries**: Frequently applying for new [credit](../c/credit.md) can lower your score.

## How To Improve a Credit Score

Improving a [credit](../c/credit.md) score takes time and consistent effort. Here are several strategies:

1. **Pay Bills on Time**: The most impactful action you can take is to ensure you pay all your bills on time.
2. **Reduce [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Pay down existing balances to reduce your [credit](../c/credit.md) utilization ratio.
3. **[Check](../c/check.md) Your [Credit Report](../c/credit_report.md)**: Regularly review your [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) for any errors or inaccuracies.
4. **Limit New [Credit](../c/credit.md) Applications**: Be cautious with how often you apply for [credit](../c/credit.md).
