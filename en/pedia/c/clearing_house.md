# Clearing House

A [clearing](../c/clearing.md) house is a central entity in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) responsible for facilitating the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of payments, securities, or [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) transactions. It acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers to ensure the smooth and efficient [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades. By providing [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) services, a [clearing](../c/clearing.md) house mitigates [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md), ensuring that both parties fulfill their [obligations](../o/obligation.md) to complete a [transaction](../t/transaction.md). This is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses operate in various markets including equities, [futures](../f/futures.md), [options](../o/options.md), and over-the-counter (OTC) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

## History and Evolution

[Clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses have a long history dating back to the 17th century, with the London [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) House established in 1773. The evolution of [clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses has paralleled the evolution of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), expanding from traditional commodities markets to modern [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md) markets. Their role and importance have grown significantly with the increased complexity and [volume](../v/volume.md) of transactions in today’s global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

## Functions 

### Trade Matching and Confirmation

[Clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses are involved in the matching and confirmation of trades. They ensure that the terms agreed upon by the buyer and the seller in a [transaction](../t/transaction.md) match and are confirmed before proceeding to the next steps. This function is critical in preventing [trade](../t/trade.md) discrepancies and disputes.

### Netting

[Netting](../n/netting.md) is a process that reduces the number of transactions and the overall [obligations](../o/obligation.md) by offsetting buy and sell positions. It helps in minimizing the settlement [risk](../r/risk.md) and operational burden. For example, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) has [multiple](../m/multiple.md) buy and sell positions in the same [security](../s/security.md), [netting](../n/netting.md) calculates the net position and the net amount to be settled.

### Risk Management

One of the primary roles of a [clearing](../c/clearing.md) house is to manage and mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md). [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses employ several [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools such as:

- **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements:** Traders are required to post [collateral](../c/collateral.md), known as margins, to cover potential losses.
- **Mark-to-[Market](../m/market.md):** Regular [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) of positions to reflect current [market](../m/market.md) prices.
- **[Default](../d/default.md) Funds:** Contributions from members to cover potential losses in the event of a member [default](../d/default.md).
- **[Stress Testing](../s/stress_testing.md):** Simulating extreme [market](../m/market.md) conditions to assess the adequacy of financial safeguards.

### Settlement

Settlement involves the actual transfer of funds and securities between parties. [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses facilitate this process by coordinating the flow of payments and securities, ensuring that each party receives what is due to them. This process reduces settlement [risk](../r/risk.md), the [risk](../r/risk.md) that one party [will](../w/will.md) [fail](../f/fail.md) to deliver on their side of the [trade](../t/trade.md).

### Custody and Asset Protection

[Clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses also provide custody services, holding securities on behalf of their members. This function ensures that assets are safely and accurately maintained, providing further protection against [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Major Clearing Houses

Several major [clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses operate globally, each serving different markets and regions. Some of the prominent [clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses include:

- **CME [Clearing](../c/clearing.md)**: Operated by the Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), it provides [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) services for [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) contracts traded at CME Group (www.cmegroup.com).

- **LCH (London [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) House)**: A leading international [clearing](../c/clearing.md) house serving major exchanges and platforms, particularly known for [clearing](../c/clearing.md) [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) and other OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) (www.lch.com).

- **DTCC ([Depository](../d/depository.md) [Trust](../t/trust.md) & [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md))**: Provides [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) services for the equities, corporate/[municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) [market](../m/market.md) in the U.S. It also offers a [range](../r/range.md) of other post-[trade](../t/trade.md) services (www.dtcc.com).

- **Eurex [Clearing](../c/clearing.md)**: Part of the [Deutsche Börse](../d/deutsche_börse.md) Group, it offers [clearing](../c/clearing.md) services for a [range](../r/range.md) of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and securities (www.eurex.com).

- **CCP12 (The Global Association of Central Counterparties)**: Represents the global [clearing](../c/clearing.md) community, advocating for effective [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) practices (www.ccp12.org).

## Regulatory Environment

[Clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses operate under stringent regulatory oversight to ensure their soundness and reliability. Regulatory frameworks vary by country but generally include requirements regarding [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, and operational procedures. Key regulations impacting [clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses include:

- **Dodd-Frank Act (USA)**: Requires higher [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) for OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), leading to the mandating of central [clearing](../c/clearing.md) through [clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses.
- **European [Market](../m/market.md) [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) Regulation (EMIR)**: Similar to Dodd-Frank, EMIR sets out requirements for OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), central counterparties, and [trade](../t/trade.md) repositories within the EU.
- **CPMI-IOSCO Principles**: Guidelines issued by the Committee on Payments and [Market](../m/market.md) Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to ensure [robust](../r/robust.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md)-resilient [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) in global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Technological Innovations

Recent technological advancements have significantly impacted the operations and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of [clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses. Some of the key innovations include:

### Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and [distributed ledger technology](../d/distributed_ledger_technology.md) (DLT) [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for real-time settlement, enhanced [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and reduced [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md). [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) houses are exploring and sometimes adopting these technologies to improve [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) processes.

### Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)

RTGS systems enable the immediate transfer of funds and securities on a [transaction](../t/transaction.md)-by-[transaction](../t/transaction.md) [basis](../b/basis.md). This reduces settlement [risk](../r/risk.md) and increases the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the [clearing](../c/clearing.md) process.
