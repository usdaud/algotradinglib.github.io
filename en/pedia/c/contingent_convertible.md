# Contingent Convertible

Contingent Convertible bonds, commonly referred to as CoCo bonds, form a unique class of hybrid [capital](../c/capital.md) [security](../s/security.md) predominantly used in the banking and financial sectors. These instruments stand out due to their ability to absorb losses and act as a cushion for banks during periods of financial stress, thereby contributing to the stability of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). Here, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into the features, mechanics, and regulatory implications of CoCos.

## Features of CoCo Bonds

### Convertible Nature
At their core, CoCo bonds blend characteristics of both [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). They provide the holder with the potential for conversion into [equity](../e/equity.md) under predetermined conditions. This convertible feature differentiates CoCos from traditional bonds, [offering](../o/offering.md) both [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward potential.

### Loss Absorption
One of the [principal](../p/principal.md) features of CoCos is their loss absorption capacity. When a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md) falls below a certain threshold, these bonds either convert to [equity](../e/equity.md) or suffer a [principal](../p/principal.md) [write-down](../w/write-down.md). This mechanism helps stabilize the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) without immediate [recourse](../r/recourse.md) to external [capital](../c/capital.md) raising measures, which might be difficult during times of [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md).

### Trigger Mechanisms
CoCo bonds incorporate specific trigger mechanisms – predefined thresholds at which conversion or [write-down](../w/write-down.md) is activated. These triggers are typically linked to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md) ratios, such as Common [Equity](../e/equity.md) Tier 1 (CET1). There are two primary types of triggers for CoCos:
- **Mechanical Triggers**: These might include specific [capital](../c/capital.md) ratio thresholds (e.g., CET1 falling below 7%).
- **Discretionary Triggers**: These can be invoked by regulators when they deem it necessary to maintain the financial stability of the institution.

### Coupon Payments
Like traditional bonds, CoCos pay periodic coupon payments; however, these payments can be suspended if the issuing [bank](../b/bank.md) is under financial stress or if regulatory restrictions come into play. Unlike traditional bonds, missed coupon payments on CoCos are usually non-cumulative, implying that the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) may lose [interest](../i/interest.md) payments permanently.

## Types of CoCos

CoCos can primarily be classified into two types based on the nature of loss absorption they provide:

### Equity Conversion CoCos
These bonds convert into a predetermined number of [equity](../e/equity.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) upon the [triggering event](../t/triggering_event.md). This conversion dilutes existing shareholders but strengthens the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) by augmenting its core [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md).

### Principal Write-down CoCos
In the event of a trigger, the [principal](../p/principal.md) [value](../v/value.md) of these bonds is either partially or fully written down. This reduction in liabilities enhances the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md) ratios without the issuance of new [equity](../e/equity.md).

## Regulatory Framework

The development and proliferation of CoCo bonds have been significantly influenced by regulatory frameworks, primarily [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), which aimed to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. CoCos are recognized as Additional Tier 1 (AT1) or [Tier 2 capital](../t/tier_2_capital.md) under [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), reflecting their role in loss absorption and [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy.

### Basel III
[Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, established stricter [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements and introduced new regulatory standards for [bank](../b/bank.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [leverage](../l/leverage.md). Under [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), CoCos are considered a crucial tool for meeting the Enhanced [Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements (ECR) whereby banks need to [hold](../h/hold.md) a higher proportion of their [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) as core [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md).

### European Regulatory Impact
In the European context, institutions like the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) have laid down specific regulations and guidelines governing the issuance and treatment of CoCos. The EBA has particularly emphasized the clarity of the trigger mechanisms and the terms of conversion/[write-down](../w/write-down.md) to ensure predictability and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in CoCo structures.

## Market for CoCos

The [market](../m/market.md) for CoCo bonds has grown significantly since their inception, driven largely by regulatory requirements and [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) in higher-yielding securities. Some notable issuers in the [market](../m/market.md) include major European banks like HSBC, Barclays, and Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md).

### Case Study: HSBC CoCo Bonds
HSBC has been a prolific [issuer](../i/issuer.md) of CoCo bonds, raising substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) to enhance its regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) base. Information about HSBC's CoCo [bond](../b/bond.md) issuances can be found in their filings.

### Investor Base and Risk Considerations
Investors in CoCo bonds include pension funds, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, and other institutional investors seeking higher yields. However, CoCos carry unique risks, primarily [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), conversion [risk](../r/risk.md), and [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) arising from their hybrid nature.

## Pricing and Valuation

The pricing of CoCo bonds is complex, reflecting their hybrid structure and embedded [options](../o/options.md). Key factors influencing CoCo [bond](../b/bond.md) pricing include:
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Reflecting the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).
- **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Conversion Likelihood**: Higher likelihood of conversion lowers the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [value](../v/value.md).
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: As with traditional bonds, [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements affect CoCo [bond](../b/bond.md) prices.

Financial models used to price CoCos often incorporate option-pricing techniques, such as the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md), adjusted for the specific characteristics of CoCos.

## Case Study: Valuation Approach
Valuating a CoCo [bond](../b/bond.md) involves assessing both the [bond](../b/bond.md)-like and [equity](../e/equity.md)-like features. For instance, consider a CoCo issued by Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md) with a 7% coupon and a conversion trigger at a 5.125% CET1 ratio. Analysts would:
1. Calculate the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [present value](../p/present_value.md) based on the 7% coupon.
2. Estimate the probability of conversion based on CET1 ratio forecasts.
3. Adjust the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [value](../v/value.md) for the potential [dilution](../d/dilution.md) effect upon conversion.

## Conclusion

Contingent Convertible bonds are a critical innovation in modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), providing banks with a tool to bolster their [capital](../c/capital.md) structures while [offering](../o/offering.md) investors potentially attractive returns. However, the complexity and [risk](../r/risk.md) inherent in these instruments require diligent analysis and [robust](../r/robust.md) regulatory oversight to ensure their efficacy and stability within the broader [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). By striking a balance between [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md), CoCo bonds represent a dynamic component of contemporary [financial engineering](../f/financial_engineering.md) and regulatory strategy.
