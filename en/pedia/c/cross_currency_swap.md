# Cross Currency Swap

A cross currency swap is a contract where two parties exchange principal and interest payments in different currencies. It is used to manage currency and interest rate exposure.

## Structure
- Initial exchange of principal in two currencies
- Periodic interest payments in each currency
- Final exchange of principal at maturity

## Use Cases
Corporations use cross currency swaps to match the currency of their debt with revenue streams. Investors use them to hedge currency risk or access funding in foreign currencies.

## Risks
Key risks include counterparty exposure, basis risk between funding markets, and changes in exchange rates. Collateral and netting agreements are often used to mitigate risk.

## Participants and Flow

Market structure concepts involve different participant roles such as brokers, dealers, clearing members, and end users. Understanding who is responsible for risk and settlement helps explain why certain rules and timelines exist.

Order flow in these systems is often constrained by cutoffs, margin rules, and reporting requirements. These constraints can create predictable liquidity patterns.

## Rules and Timing

Most venues define specific trading hours, order cutoffs, and auction procedures. Deadlines for submission, modification, or cancellation can affect execution quality, especially near the open or close.

Regulatory rules also shape market behavior, including position limits, reporting thresholds, and trade review windows.

## Data and Reporting

Market data feeds provide different views of activity, such as top of book, full depth, or auction imbalance. Reporting data, such as positioning reports, can be useful for sentiment and risk analysis.

Data delays, revisions, and venue differences can create mismatches, so sources should be documented and monitored.

## Impact on Trading

Understanding the market structure helps traders choose appropriate order types, manage settlement risk, and anticipate liquidity shifts. It also influences how strategies behave around roll dates, auctions, or regulatory events.

## Operational Risks

Operational risk includes failed settlements, incorrect contract details, and unexpected rule changes. Robust processes and regular checks reduce these risks, especially for larger portfolios.

## Operational Notes

Definitions and conventions should be consistent across datasets and venues. A small difference in data fields or session boundaries can change outcomes, especially for short term strategies. Document inputs and assumptions so results can be reproduced.

If the concept depends on exchange rules or broker behavior, confirm those rules for the specific venue. Operational details often explain why a trade behaved differently than expected.

## Stress Scenarios

During volatility spikes, liquidity can evaporate and price gaps can appear. Under these conditions, indicators can lag, order types can misfire, and spreads can widen sharply.

Stress testing the concept against fast markets, thin liquidity, and sudden news helps reveal hidden risks. If a strategy only works in calm conditions, size and timing should reflect that.

## Documentation Tips

Keep a short checklist of the rules, parameters, and decision points. Record how the concept is used in live trading and compare it to backtest assumptions. This makes future refinement easier and reduces drift in execution.

## Common Questions

Traders often ask how sensitive results are to parameter choices, how the concept behaves in different regimes, and whether it scales with size. Answering these questions early improves reliability and prevents overfitting.
