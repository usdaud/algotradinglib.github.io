# Chapter 11 Bankruptcy

The concept of Chapter 11 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), part of the United States [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) Code, is a legal [provision](../p/provision.md) that offers a financially distressed [business](../b/business.md) the opportunity to restructure its debts and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) while continuing operations, rather than facing outright [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md). This process is often colloquially referred to as "[reorganization](../r/reorganization.md)" [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md). This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Chapter 11 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), how it operates, the roles of different stakeholders, and its long-term impact on businesses and creditors.

## The Legal Framework of Chapter 11

Chapter 11 of the [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) Code is uniquely designed to help struggling businesses, including major corporations, small enterprises, partnerships, and even individuals under specific circumstances. It allows the debtor to propose a plan for profitable recovery and strategic [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) while maintaining some control over the [business](../b/business.md) operations as a “debtor in possession” unless a [trustee](../t/trustee.md) is appointed for the case.

### Filing for Chapter 11

Filing for Chapter 11 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) involves several steps and documentation requirements:

1. **Petition Filing**: The process starts with the filing of a voluntary petition by the debtor or an involuntary petition by creditors.
2. **Automatic Stay**: Upon filing, an automatic stay comes into effect. This halts all collections, lawsuits, and garnishments against the debtor's assets.
3. **Required Documents**: Debtors must file a list of creditors, a schedule of assets and liabilities, a schedule of current [income](../i/income.md) and expenditures, a statement of financial affairs, and a schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases.

## The Debtor in Possession (DIP)

Under Chapter 11, the company continues to operate its [business](../b/business.md) as the debtor in possession (DIP). The role of the DIP is crucial, as it retains control over everyday [business](../b/business.md) decisions while formulating a [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md) plan.

### DIP's Responsibilities

- **Operating the [Business](../b/business.md)**: The DIP continues to manage the day-to-day operations of the [business](../b/business.md), making [business](../b/business.md) decisions and transactions necessary for [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md).
- **Filing Monthly Reports**: The DIP must file monthly operating reports with the [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) court.
- **Developing the Plan**: The DIP is responsible for drafting a [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md) plan, which [will](../w/will.md) be assessed by creditors and the court.

## The Reorganization Plan

The cornerstone of Chapter 11 proceedings is the [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md) plan. The plan outlines how the debtor intends to manage its [business](../b/business.md), reduce its debts, and address creditors' claims.

### Plan Development

- **Proposal**: The debtor has an exclusive period, usually 120 days, to propose a [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md) plan without competition from creditors. Extensions can be granted.
- **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) Statement**: The debtor must file a [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) statement that provides adequate information for creditors to evaluate the plan.
- **Confirmation by Creditors**: Once submitted, creditors vote on the plan. For approval, it typically requires acceptance by at least one impaired class of creditors, assuming it meets the feasibility, fair and equitable, and best [interest](../i/interest.md) requirements.

### Plan Confirmation

The court must confirm any [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md) plan. To confirm the plan, several conditions must be satisfied:
- **Best [Interest](../i/interest.md) of Creditors**: Creditors must receive at least as much under the plan as they would if the debtor's assets were liquidated.
- **Feasibility**: The plan must be feasible, meaning that it is likely to succeed and allow the debtor to reorganize effectively.
- **Good Faith**: The plan must be proposed in good faith, without any ulterior motives such as [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

## Role of the Trustee and Creditors

While the debtor usually stays in control as DIP, a [trustee](../t/trustee.md) might be appointed in cases where there is evidence of gross mismanagement or [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Trustee

- **Oversight**: The [trustee](../t/trustee.md) oversees the [business](../b/business.md) operations, ensuring compliance with laws and responsible management.
- **Operational Control**: In some cases, the [trustee](../t/trustee.md) may take control of the debtor’s operations.

### Creditors' Committees

- **[Unsecured Creditors](../u/unsecured_creditors.md)' Committee**: This committee represents the interests of [unsecured creditors](../u/unsecured_creditors.md) and participates in negotiations regarding the [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md) plan.
- **Court’s Role**: The [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) court may appoint additional committees for [equity](../e/equity.md) holders or other groups of creditors.

## Impact on Stakeholders

Chapter 11 affects a variety of stakeholders, including the debtor, creditors (both secured and unsecured), employees, shareholders, and suppliers.

### Employees

Employees may face uncertainties such as changes in their job roles or layoffs, yet the company’s continued operations often preserve jobs that would otherwise be lost with [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).

### Creditors

Creditors play a key role in the [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) process. Secured and [unsecured creditors](../u/unsecured_creditors.md) have different priorities and protections:

- **Secured Creditors**: Typically have the first right to claims on secured assets, often influencing the [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md) plan significantly.
- **[Unsecured Creditors](../u/unsecured_creditors.md)**: Often need to negotiate the terms of [repayment](../r/repayment.md) under the [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md) plan and might recover only a portion of the original claims.

### Shareholders

Shareholders typically stand behind creditors in priority and might lose significant [value](../v/value.md) in their [shares](../s/shares.md), as [debt restructuring](../d/debt_restructuring.md) often involves the issuance of new [equity](../e/equity.md) or stock [dilution](../d/dilution.md).

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits

- **Operational Continuity**: Enables businesses to continue their operations and potentially [return](../r/return.md) to profitability.
- **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Reduction**: Facilitates the reduction or [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) of debts, providing financial relief.
- **Time for Strategic Change**: Allows time for the company to implement strategic changes needed for long-term viability.

### Drawbacks

- **Costly and Complex**: Legal fees, court costs, and professional consultancy fees can be substantial.
- **Time-Consuming**: The process can take years, prolonging [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) for all stakeholders.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) of Failure**: Not all businesses successfully emerge from Chapter 11; some might still face [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
