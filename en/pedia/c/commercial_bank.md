# Commercial Bank

Commercial banks are financial institutions that accept deposits, [offer](../o/offer.md) [checking account](../c/checking_account.md) services, make [business](../b/business.md), personal, and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans, and [offer](../o/offer.md) basic financial products like certificates of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) (CDs) and savings accounts to individuals and small businesses.
