# Cost of Capital

The term "Cost of [Capital](../c/capital.md)" refers to the required [return](../r/return.md) necessary to make a [capital budgeting](../c/capital_budgeting.md) project, such as building a new factory, worthwhile. When people speak about the cost of [capital](../c/capital.md), they refer to both the [cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md) and the [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) that a company pays to [finance](../f/finance.md) its operations. The concept is pivotal in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) theory and offers a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for management to make investment and operational decisions. Understanding the cost of [capital](../c/capital.md) helps companies select the best [financing](../f/financing.md) [options](../o/options.md) and allocate resources more efficiently.

## Components of Cost of Capital

### Cost of Debt

The [cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md) is the effective rate that a company pays on its borrowed funds. It can be calculated before or after tax, as [interest](../i/interest.md) on [debt](../d/debt.md) is tax-deductible.

#### Calculation

\[ \text{Cost of Debt} (r_d) = \frac{\text{[Interest Expense](../i/interest_expense.md)}}{\text{Total [Debt](../d/debt.md)}} \]

After taking tax benefits into account:

\[ \text{After-Tax [Cost of Debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md)} = r_d \times (1 - \text{[Tax Rate](../t/tax_rate.md)}) \]

### Cost of Equity

The [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) is the [return](../r/return.md) that [equity](../e/equity.md) investors expect on their investment in the [firm](../f/firm.md). Unlike [debt](../d/debt.md), it does not have a clear-cut calculation, and several methods exist to estimate it.

#### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

One of the most common methods is the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM), which calculates [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) as:

\[ \text{[Cost of Equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md)} (r_e) = r_f + \[beta](../b/beta.md) \times (r_m - r_f) \]

where:
- \( r_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
- \( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \) is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the stock (its [volatility](../v/volatility.md) relative to the [market](../m/market.md))
- \( r_m \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the [market](../m/market.md)

#### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

Another method is the [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Discount](../d/discount.md) Model (DDM), particularly useful for companies that pay regular dividends:

\[ \text{[Cost of Equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md)} (r_e) = \frac{D_1}{P_0} + g \]

where:
- \( D_1 \) is the expected [dividend](../d/dividend.md) per share one year from now
- \( P_0 \) is the current stock price
- \( g \) is the growth rate of dividends

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

Most firms use a mix of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md), and the [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Cost of [Capital](../c/capital.md) (WACC) combines these components into a single figure.

\[ \text{WACC} = \frac{E}{V} \times r_e + \frac{D}{V} \times r_d \times (1 - \text{[Tax Rate](../t/tax_rate.md)}) \]

where:
- \( E \) is the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the [equity](../e/equity.md)
- \( D \) is the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the [debt](../d/debt.md)
- \( V \) is total [value](../v/value.md) ( \( E + D \) )

### Factors Affecting Cost of Capital

Several variables influence a company's cost of [capital](../c/capital.md):

#### Economic Conditions

- [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates: Higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates increase the [cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md).
- [Market Risk Premium](../m/market_risk_premium.md): Changes in the expected [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md) impact the [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md).

#### Company-Specific Factors

- [Credit Rating](../c/credit_rating.md): A better [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) lowers the [cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md).
- [Operational Risk](../o/operational_risk.md): Higher [business risk](../b/business_risk.md) increases the required [return](../r/return.md) on [equity](../e/equity.md).
- [Capital Structure](../c/capital_structure.md): The mix of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) influences the overall WACC.

### Importance in Corporate Decision Making

#### Investment Decisions

Companies use the cost of [capital](../c/capital.md) to evaluate potential investments. If the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) on an investment exceeds the cost of [capital](../c/capital.md), the investment is considered viable.

#### Financing Decisions

Different funding sources have different costs. By comparing these, firms can choose lower-cost [financing](../f/financing.md) [options](../o/options.md) to minimize their WACC.

#### Performance Metrics

The cost of [capital](../c/capital.md) serves as a [hurdle rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md) in performance assessments. Comparing the actual [return](../r/return.md) on investment to the cost of [capital](../c/capital.md) helps to gauge [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [value](../v/value.md) creation.

### Practical Applications

#### Risk Assessment

Understanding the components that contribute to the cost of [capital](../c/capital.md) enables firms to better assess project risks and make more informed investment decisions.

#### Valuation

Cost of [capital](../c/capital.md) is also a critical input for [valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md), influencing the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of future cash flows.

#### Portfolio Management

In [portfolio management](../p/par.md), the cost of [capital](../c/capital.md) helps in the selection and balancing of securities to achieve optimum returns at minimized [risk](../r/risk.md).
