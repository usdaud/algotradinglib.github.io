# Cash Dividend

A cash [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is a [payment](../p/payment.md) made by a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) to its shareholders in the form of cash, typically as a [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of profits. This form of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is one of the most common ways that companies [return](../r/return.md) [value](../v/value.md) to their shareholders. It contrasts with other types of dividends such as stock dividends or property dividends. Understanding the mechanics, benefits, and implications of cash dividends is crucial for investors, particularly those engaged in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algotrading).

## Basics of Cash Dividend

### Definition
A cash [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is defined as a direct [payment](../p/payment.md) of cash to shareholders. The amount of the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is usually expressed on a per-share [basis](../b/basis.md). For example, a company might declare a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) of $1.50 per share. Shareholders owning 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) would receive $150.

### Declaration and Payment Process
1. **Board Approval**: The company's board of directors must formally declare a [dividend](../d/dividend.md); it is not an automatic or legally required [distribution](../d/distribution.md).
2. **Declaration Date**: This is the date when the board announces the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md).
3. **[Ex-Dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) Date**: The cutoff date to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive the [dividend](../d/dividend.md). If you purchase the stock on or after this date, you won’t receive the upcoming [dividend](../d/dividend.md).
4. **[Record Date](../r/record_date.md)**: The date by which investors must be on the company’s books as shareholders to receive the [dividend](../d/dividend.md).
5. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Date**: The date when the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is actually paid to shareholders.

## Purpose and Importance

### Rewarding Shareholders
Cash dividends are often used by mature and profitable companies to distribute [surplus](../s/surplus.md) [earnings](../e/earnings.md) to shareholders. It is a method of providing a [return](../r/return.md) on their investment without requiring them to sell their [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Signaling Financial Health
The declaration of regular cash dividends can signal to the [market](../m/market.md) that a company is financially stable and confident in its future cash flows. It acts as a positive signal to existing and potential investors.

### Providing Income
Many investors, particularly retirees, rely on dividends as a source of [income](../i/income.md). Cash dividends provide immediate [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), which is useful for those seeking regular [income](../i/income.md) from their investments.

## Implications for Algotrading

### Dividend Capture Strategies
Algorithmic traders often engage in [dividend capture strategies](../d/dividend_capture_strategies.md), which involve buying a stock just before its [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date and selling it shortly thereafter. By doing so, they aim to capture the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md). This strategy is based on the understanding that stock prices typically drop by the amount of the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) on the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date, but the drop is not always perfectly aligned, allowing for [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md).

### Impact on Stock Valuation
The [payment](../p/payment.md) of a cash [dividend](../d/dividend.md) affects a company's stock price as the [market](../m/market.md) adjusts for the [payout](../p/payout.md). Sophisticated algotrading models take into account the anticipated drop in stock price on the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date and might adjust [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) accordingly.

### Tax Considerations
In [multiple](../m/multiple.md) jurisdictions, dividends are taxed differently compared to other forms of [income](../i/income.md). Algotrading strategies often incorporate tax implications into their decision-making process to maximize after-tax returns.

## Calculations Involved

### Dividend Yield
One common metric is the [dividend yield](../d/dividend_yield.md), calculated as:
\[ \text{[Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)} = \left( \frac{\text{Annual [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Per Share}}{\text{Price Per Share}} \right) \]

### Payout Ratio
The [payout ratio](../p/payout_ratio.md) is the proportion of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) paid out as dividends, calculated as:
\[ \text{[Payout Ratio](../p/payout_ratio.md)} = \left( \frac{\text{Dividends}}{\text{Net [Income](../i/income.md)}} \right) \]

## Case Studies and Examples

### Apple Inc.
Apple AAPL is known for its significant cash reserves and has been returning cash to shareholders via dividends and [share buybacks](../s/share_buybacks.md). The company declared a cash [dividend](../d/dividend.md) of $0.22 per share in the third quarter of 2021.

### Johnson & Johnson
Johnson & Johnson JNJ is another example of a company with a long history of paying consistent and growing dividends. As of early 2023, the company declared a quarterly cash [dividend](../d/dividend.md) of $1.13 per share.

### Dividend Aristocrats
The term "[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Aristocrats" refers to companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 25 years or more. Examples include Coca-Cola KO and Procter & Gamble PG.

## Risks and Concerns

### Reduced Retained Earnings
Paying out too much in dividends can reduce the company's [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), limiting its ability to invest in growth opportunities or to weather economic downturns.

### Market Expectations
Once a company establishes a pattern of paying regular dividends, any disruption or reduction in the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) can adversely affect its stock price, as it may signal [underlying](../u/underlying.md) financial troubles.

### Interest Rate Environment
In a rising [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment, [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-paying [stocks](../s/stock.md) can become less attractive compared to bonds and other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities, potentially leading to decreased stock prices.

## Conclusion

Cash dividends serve as a crucial mechanism for companies to share their financial success with shareholders. They act as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), provide a source of regular [income](../i/income.md) for investors, and play a significant role in various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) including algotrading. While beneficial, cash dividends also come with certain risks and considerations that both companies and investors must diligently manage.
