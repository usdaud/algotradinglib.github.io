# Computational Trading

Computational trading, also known as [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) or algo trading, is a method of executing trades using automated pre-programmed trading instructions to account for variables such as time, price, and [volume](../v/volume.md). This type of trading relies heavily on complex [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and high-speed computing to make decisions and execute trades at speeds far beyond the capability of human traders.

## Core Concepts

### Algorithms
An algorithm in trading is a set of rules or instructions programmed to automatically perform several trading actions. These could be simple or complex and can include strategies such as [market](../m/market.md) making, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), or executing large orders with minimal [market](../m/market.md) impact. 

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
HFT is a specific subset of computational trading where the goal is to make very short-term trades. These trades are executed in milliseconds, and the systems involved require minimal latency. Firms engaged in HFT often co-locate their servers as close to the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) as possible to [gain](../g/gain.md) microseconds of advantage over competitors.

### Quantitative Models
[Quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) are mathematical constructs used to predict stock price movements. These models can [range](../r/range.md) from simple moving averages to complex machine [learning algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) and are often developed by "quants" - specialists in [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md).

### Market Microstructure
Understanding the [market microstructure](../m/market_microstructure.md), which includes the mechanisms and protocols of trading ([order book dynamics](../o/order_book_dynamics.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)), is essential for developing and implementing effective [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) within computational trading.

## Key Players in Computational Trading

### Renaissance Technologies
Renaissance Technologies is perhaps one of the most famous quant-based [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds in the world. Founded by Jim Simons, a former mathematics professor and codebreaker, the [firm](../f/firm.md) employs sophisticated algorithms to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on small inefficiencies in the [market](../m/market.md). Their flagship [fund](../f/fund.md), Medallion, has posted extraordinary returns for decades.

### Citadel
Founded by Ken Griffin, Citadel is a global financial institution with a significant focus on [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Citadel Securities, an affiliate of Citadel LLC, is one of the largest [market](../m/market.md) makers in securities, including [stocks](../s/stock.md) and [options](../o/options.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and trading services.

### Two Sigma
Two Sigma leverages [big data](../b/big_data_in_trading.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) to develop [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). Their team includes engineers, data scientists, and statisticians who work together to refine their [trading models](../t/trading_models.md) and strategies continuously.

### Virtu Financial
Virtu Financial is a high-frequency trading [firm](../f/firm.md) that uses sophisticated algorithms to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to various markets while managing [risk](../r/risk.md) through real-time analytics. They operate globally across a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

## Implementation Techniques

### Statistical Arbitrage
Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves placing trades based on sophisticated statistical models that identify inefficiencies between related instruments. It often involves [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), where two correlated instruments are traded with the assumption that any [divergence](../d/divergence.md) in their price relationship is temporary.

### Market Making
[Market](../m/market.md) making involves continuously submitting buy and sell orders for various securities to ensure [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). The [profit](../p/profit.md) for [market](../m/market.md) makers comes from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md), but the techniques involved require [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and real-time adjustment.

### Execution Algorithms
[Execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md) are designed to break down large orders into smaller parts to reduce [market](../m/market.md) impact. Examples include [Volume](../v/volume.md) [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price (VWAP) and Time [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price (TWAP) algorithms, which spread out the [execution](../e/execution.md) over a specified [duration](../d/duration.md).

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages
Common programming languages in computational trading include Python, C++, Java, and R. Python is particularly popular for its data analysis libraries such as pandas and NumPy, while C++ is favored for its [execution](../e/execution.md) speed.

### Data Feeds
Real-time data feeds are crucial for computational trading. Companies like [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) and Thomson [Reuters](../r/reuters.md) provide comprehensive data services, including historical [tick](../t/tick.md) data, news feeds, and [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md).

### Computing Hardware
To achieve low-latency trading, high-performance computing (HPC) hardware, including Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), is often used. Some firms also employ custom-built servers and co-location services to mitigate latency.

## Challenges and Risks

### Latency Arbitrage
Latency [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking advantage of delays in the dissemination of [market](../m/market.md) information. While [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md), this strategy has raised concerns about fairness and the integrity of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), leading to regulatory scrutiny.

### Model Risk
Reliance on [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) introduces [model risk](../m/model_risk.md) - the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the models [fail](../f/fail.md) to predict future price movements accurately. Continuous model validation and [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) are essential in mitigating these risks.

### Regulatory Environment
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is subject to regulation, varying significantly by jurisdiction. In the U.S., the SEC and CFTC impose various regulations to ensure [market](../m/market.md) stability and fairness. In Europe, [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) introduces stringent regulatory requirements on [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) practices.

## Current Trends and the Future

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
AI and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) are being increasingly integrated into [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) to enhance prediction accuracy and adaptive capability. This includes using [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP) to analyze news and [social media sentiment](../s/social_media_sentiment.md).

### Blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology and DeFi are transforming the trading landscape by enabling decentralized exchanges and [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), which could bring about new opportunities for computational [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Quantum Computing
As [quantum computing](../q/quantum_computing_in_trading.md) technology matures, it promises unparalleled computational power, potentially transforming how complex financial computations are performed and providing a significant edge in developing and executing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Conclusion
Computational trading represents the cutting-edge intersection of [finance](../f/finance.md), mathematics, and computer science. As technology advances, the methods and strategies [will](../w/will.md) continue to evolve, presenting both opportunities and challenges for traders and the [market](../m/market.md) as a whole.
