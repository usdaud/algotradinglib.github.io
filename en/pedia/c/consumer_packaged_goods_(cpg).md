# Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG)

Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) refer to products that are sold quickly and at relatively low cost. Examples include household items, food and beverages, cosmetics, and toiletries.

### Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) Models
The rise of direct-to-consumer (D2C) models allows companies to bypass traditional retail channels and sell directly to consumers via online platforms. This approach not only enhances [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md) but also provides valuable consumer insights and strengthens [brand loyalty](../b/brand_loyalty.md).

### Advanced Analytics and AI
The use of advanced analytics and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) is expected to grow, enabling companies to predict consumer behavior, optimize [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md), and streamline [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) operations.
