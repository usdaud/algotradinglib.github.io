# CAPE Ratio

The Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (CAPE) ratio, also known as the Shiller P/E ratio or P/E 10, is a popular financial metric developed by renowned [economist](../e/economist.md) Robert Shiller. It is employed to evaluate whether a [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) by comparing its current price to its average [earnings](../e/earnings.md) over the past 10 years, adjusted for [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

## Origin and Development

Robert Shiller, along with John Campbell, introduced the concept of the CAPE ratio in a seminal paper published in 1988. The primary motivation behind CAPE was to provide a more stable and reliable [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metric by smoothing out short-term fluctuations in a company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) which could be influenced by [business](../b/business.md) cycles, economic downturns, or other transient factors.

## Calculation

The CAPE ratio is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{CAPE Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Price of the S&P 500 Index}}{\text{average real [earnings](../e/earnings.md) of the S&P 500 companies over the past 10 years}} \]

Here, "real [earnings](../e/earnings.md)" refer to [earnings](../e/earnings.md) adjusted for [inflation](../i/inflation.md), typically using the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index.md) (CPI).

### Steps to Calculate CAPE Ratio

1. **Collect Data**: Obtain the historical [earnings](../e/earnings.md) data of the companies in the [market index](../m/market_index.md) (commonly the S&P 500) for at least the past 10 years.
  
2. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Adjustment**: Adjust these [earnings](../e/earnings.md) figures for [inflation](../i/inflation.md) to reflect their real [value](../v/value.md). This is typically done using the CPI.
  
3. **Average Calculation**: Compute the average of the yearly [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-adjusted [earnings](../e/earnings.md) over the 10-year period.
  
4. **Current Price**: Obtain the current [price level](../p/price_level.md) of the [market index](../m/market_index.md).
  
5. **Compute Ratio**: Divide the current price by the 10-year average [earnings](../e/earnings.md) to get the CAPE ratio.

## Interpretation

The CAPE ratio helps in understanding the [market](../m/market.md)'s [valuation](../v/valuation.md) in a broader context compared to its historical [earnings](../e/earnings.md) performance. Here's a rough guide to interpret the CAPE ratio:

1. **High CAPE Ratio**: Indicates that the [market](../m/market.md) may be [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) and could be headed for a potential downturn or [correction](../c/correction.md). Historically, a CAPE ratio above 25 has often been a cautionary signal.
  
2. **Low CAPE Ratio**: Suggests the [market](../m/market.md) might be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), potentially [offering](../o/offering.md) buying opportunities. Typically, a CAPE ratio below 15 is considered an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of undervaluation.

## Historical Context

The CAPE ratio has been used to predict some of the significant [market](../m/market.md) events:

- **1929 [Stock Market Crash](../s/stock_market_crash.md)**: Before the crash, the CAPE ratio was very high, signaling overvaluation.
  
- **Dot-Com Bubble (2000)**: CAPE reached historically high levels, preceding a severe [market](../m/market.md) [correction](../c/correction.md).
  
- **2008 [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md)**: Again, an elevated CAPE ratio warned of the impending [market](../m/market.md) downturn.

## Strengths of CAPE Ratio

1. **Long-Term Perspective**: By averaging [earnings](../e/earnings.md) over a decade, it smooths out short-term [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [business cycle](../b/business_cycle.md) effects.
  
2. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Adjustment**: Real [earnings](../e/earnings.md) provide a clearer picture of true earning power over time.
  
3. **Historical Validity**: CAPE has been a reliable [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of [market](../m/market.md) trends and potential reversals.

## Limitations and Criticisms

1. **Backward-Looking**: Critics argue that the CAPE ratio is inherently backward-looking and may not accurately reflect future [market](../m/market.md) conditions or [earnings](../e/earnings.md) potential.
  
2. **Structural Changes**: [Market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) and structures change over time. The CAPE ratio, based on historical data, might not account for these structural developments.
  
3. **Sector Composition Changes**: Over time, the sector composition of [market](../m/market.md) indices like the S&P 500 changes significantly. Comparing current CAPE ratios with historical ones might not be entirely apples-to-apples.

4. **[Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md)**: CAPE does not adjust for varying [discount](../d/discount.md) rates or changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates which can impact stock valuations significantly.

## Practical Application

### Investment Strategies

1. **[Market Timing](../m/market_timing.md)**: Some investors use CAPE to guide their [market](../m/market.md) entry and exit points, aiming to buy when the CAPE ratio is low and sell when it is high.
  
2. **[Asset Allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md)**: CAPE ratio can also assist in tactical [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) by increasing exposure to equities when the CAPE ratio is low and reducing it when the ratio is high.

### Case Study: Grantham, Mayo, & van Otterloo (GMO)

GMO, an [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) co-founded by Jeremy Grantham, is known for utilizing the CAPE ratio in its long-term [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). They focus on achieving returns by taking advantage of [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies revealed by metrics like CAPE.

## CAPE Ratio Across Different Markets

The CAPE ratio is not confined to the U.S. [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). Investors and analysts apply it to various markets to gauge their relative valuations. For instance, the CAPE ratios for emerging markets, European markets, or specific country indices like Japan's [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225 are also frequently scrutinized.

## Modern Adaptations and Variants

### CAPE Yield

One modern adaptation is the CAPE [Yield](../y/yield.md), essentially the inverse of the CAPE ratio. It expresses the [earnings yield](../e/earnings_yield.md) of the [market](../m/market.md), making it comparable to [bond](../b/bond.md) yields.

\[ \text{CAPE [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \frac{1}{\text{CAPE Ratio}} \]

This provides a perspective on the expected long-term returns from equities compared to fixed-[income](../i/income.md) assets.

### Sector-Specific CAPE

Given the changing sectoral composition of markets, sector-specific CAPE ratios can provide more granular insights. Analysts calculate CAPE ratios for specific sectors like technology, healthcare, or [finance](../f/finance.md) to gauge relative sector valuations and identify potential investment opportunities.

### Machine Learning and Big Data

In recent years, the integration of machine learning and [big data analytics](../b/big_data_analytics_in_trading.md) has allowed for more sophisticated modeling and [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) using the CAPE ratio. [Predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) that consider a broader set of variables, including macroeconomic indicators, sentiment data, and global interconnectedness, enhance the predictive power of the CAPE ratio.

## Conclusion

The CAPE ratio remains a valuable tool for investors and analysts, [offering](../o/offering.md) a long-term perspective on [market](../m/market.md) [valuation](../v/valuation.md). While not without its limitations, its historical track record in predicting [market](../m/market.md) trends, coupled with modern adaptations, continues to make it a relevant and widely-used metric. By understanding and interpreting the CAPE ratio, investors can make more informed decisions about [market timing](../m/market_timing.md), [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), and identifying potential investment opportunities.
