# Common Law

## Definition
**Common Law** is a body of unwritten laws based on legal precedents established by the courts. It is derived from the judicial decisions of courts and similar tribunals rather than statutes or written legislation. Common law guides judicial decision-making in cases where statutes are not explicit.

## Key Components
1. **Precedents**: Judicial decisions from previous cases that provide a legal standard for judges to follow in future similar cases.
2. **Judicial Decisions**: The primary source of common law is the rulings and opinions issued by judges.
3. **Case Law**: Another term for common law, emphasizing its [basis](../b/basis.md) in detailed records of judicial decisions in individual cases.
4. **[Stare Decisis](../s/stare_decisis.md)**: A legal principle meaning "to stand by things decided," which ensures stability and predictability in the law by adhering to precedents.

## Importance
1. **Consistency and Predictability**: Common law ensures consistency in legal rulings, which helps individuals and businesses understand and anticipate the outcomes of legal disputes.
2. **Flexibility**: Common law can adapt to changing circumstances and societal norms, as judges can interpret and modify the law over time through their decisions.
3. **Detailed [Guidance](../g/guidance.md)**: Provides detailed [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on specific legal issues through comprehensive case law and judicial opinions.

## Development of Common Law
1. **Historical Origins**: Common law originated in England during the Middle Ages and was later adopted by many countries that were former British colonies, including the United States, Canada, and Australia.
2. **Judicial Interpretation**: Over centuries, judges have created a vast body of legal principles through their interpretations of statutes and legal precedents.

## Application
1. **Civil Cases**: Common law primarily governs civil cases, including contract disputes, torts (like personal injury), property disputes, and family law matters.
2. **Criminal Cases**: Some criminal laws are also based on common law, particularly in areas where statutes do not provide clear guidelines.
3. **Supplementing Statutes**: In many jurisdictions, common law supplements statutory laws by filling [gaps](../g/gap.md) and providing detailed interpretations.

## Example Scenario
### Tort Law
A person slips and falls on a wet floor in a grocery store and sues the store for negligence. The court [will](../w/will.md) look at previous common law cases to determine if the store had a duty to keep the floor safe, if they breached that duty, and if the breach caused the person's injury. The decision [will](../w/will.md) be based on established legal precedents from similar cases.

### Contract Law
Two businesses enter into a contract, and a dispute arises regarding the terms of the agreement. The court [will](../w/will.md) interpret the contract based on common law principles established through prior judicial decisions on similar contractual issues.

## Differences from Civil Law
1. **Written Codes**: Civil law systems rely more on written codes and statutes that provide comprehensive legal rules and principles.
2. **Role of Judges**: In civil law systems, judges have a more limited role in creating law and primarily apply statutory codes to individual cases.
3. **Precedent**: While precedents may influence civil law decisions, they do not have the same binding authority as in common law systems.

## Conclusion
Common law is a foundational legal system that relies on judicial precedents to guide decision-making. It provides consistency, predictability, and flexibility in the application of the law, ensuring that legal principles can adapt over time. Understanding common law is crucial for navigating legal issues in jurisdictions where it forms the [basis](../b/basis.md) of the legal system.
