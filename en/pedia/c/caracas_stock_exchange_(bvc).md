#### Fixed Income Securities

The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) also facilitates trading in fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities such as government and corporate bonds, which [offer](../o/offer.md) safer investment avenues compared to equities.

#### Derivatives

### Investor Sentiment

The trading volumes and price fluctuations on the BVC serve as indicators of domestic and foreign [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence in the Venezuelan [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Key Indices

### Caracas Stock Exchange Index (IBC)

The [principal](../p/principal.md) [index](../i/index.md) of the BVC, IBC tracks the performance of the most actively traded [stocks](../s/stock.md). It's a key [indicator](../i/indicator.md) used by investors to gauge overall [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).

### Financial Sector Index (FSA)
