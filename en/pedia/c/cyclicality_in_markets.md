# Cyclicality in Markets

Cyclicality in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) refers to the tendency of these markets to follow identifiable cycles or patterns over time. These cycles can be influenced by various economic, financial, and even psychological factors and can [range](../r/range.md) from short-term movements to long-term trends. Understanding cyclicality is crucial for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (algotrading) strategies, as it allows traders to develop algorithms that can predict and exploit these patterns.

## Economic Cycles

[Economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md), also known as [business](../b/business.md) cycles, are typically classified into four distinct phases: [expansion](../e/expansion.md), peak, contraction, and [trough](../t/trough.md).

1. **[Expansion](../e/expansion.md)**: Characterized by increasing economic activity, rising employment, and growing gross domestic product (GDP).
2. **Peak**: The point at which economic activity reaches its highest level before beginning to decline.
3. **Contraction**: Marked by decreasing economic activity, rising [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), and a slowing GDP.
4. **[Trough](../t/trough.md)**: The lowest point of economic activity before the cycle begins anew with a period of [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

[Economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) such as GDP [growth rates](../g/growth_rates_in_trading.md), employment figures, and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates can be useful for identifying these cycles.

## Market Cycles

[Market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md) are driven by [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment, economic data, and overall [market](../m/market.md) conditions. These can be subdivided into several types:

### Boom and Bust Cycles

These cycles are characterized by rapid price increases followed by sharp declines. During a boom, [asset](../a/asset.md) prices rise significantly, often driven by [investor](../i/investor.md) optimism and speculative behavior. The bust phase is marked by severe [market](../m/market.md) corrections and a [return](../r/return.md) to more rational price levels.

### Secular and Cyclical Trends

- **[Secular](../s/secular.md) Trends**: Long-term trends that can last for decades. They are often driven by major economic or technological shifts.
- **Cyclical Trends**: Shorter-term trends lasting several years. These are typically tied to the [business cycle](../b/business_cycle.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment.

### Seasonal Cycles

Seasonal cycles are patterns that recur at specific times of the year. These can be influenced by fiscal calendars, holiday periods, or significant agricultural cycles.

### Industry-specific Cycles

Different industries may experience cycles unique to their specific conditions. For example, retail may see increased activity during holiday seasons, while agriculture may be impacted by planting and harvest periods.

## Psychological Cycles

[Investor](../i/investor.md) psychology plays a crucial role in [market](../m/market.md) cyclicality. The phases of a psychological cycle can include:

1. **Optimism**: Confidence in rising markets.
2. **Euphoria**: Overconfidence, often leading to [bubbles](../b/bubble.md).
3. **Anxiety**: First signs of trouble.
4. **Denial**: Refusal to acknowledge a downturn.
5. **Panic**: Widespread selling.
6. **[Capitulation](../c/capitulation.md)**: Acceptance of losses.
7. **Despondency**: [Market](../m/market.md) low and potential buy signals.
8. **Hope**: Early signs of recovery.

## Algorithms and Cyclicality

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), understanding [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md) is critical for the development of models that can predict [market](../m/market.md) movements.

### Moving Averages

Moving averages smooth out price data to identify trends. Common types include:

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: Average price over a specific period.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Places more weight on recent prices.

### Oscillators

Oscillators measure [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and can indicate [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions. Examples include:

- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI)**: Measures the magnitude and velocity of directional price movements.
- **[Stochastic Oscillator](../s/stochastic_oscillator.md)**: Compares a [security](../s/security.md)'s closing price to its price [range](../r/range.md) over a specific period.

### Mean Reversion

[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies assume that prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical average over time. Algorithms may identify overextended price movements and anticipate reversals.

### Machine Learning Models

[Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models can be trained to identify complex patterns in [market](../m/market.md) data. Techniques include:

- **[Supervised Learning](../s/supervised_learning.md)**: Algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions.
- **[Unsupervised Learning](../u/unsupervised_learning.md)**: Algorithms identify patterns and anomalies in unlabeled data.

## Companies Specializing in Algorithmic Trading

Several notable companies and platforms focus on [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and may [offer](../o/offer.md) tools to help understand and exploit [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md):

- **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)**: [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/) provides a cloud-based platform for designing and [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).
- **[Alpaca](../a/alpaca.md)**: [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) offers [commission](../c/commission.md)-free trading with an API for executing algorithmic strategies.
- **Two Sigma**: [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) uses [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), distributed computing, and vast amounts of data to build [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

Understanding cyclicality in markets is fundamental for devising [robust](../r/robust.md) algotrading strategies. By analyzing economic, [market](../m/market.md), and psychological cycles, and leveraging algorithms to identify and predict these patterns, traders can increase their chances of success in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
