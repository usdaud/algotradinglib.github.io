# Corporate Governance

Corporate governance refers to the system by which corporations are directed and controlled. It encompasses the mechanisms, processes, and relations used by various parties like shareholders, board of directors, and management to ensure accountability, fairness, and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in a company's relationship with its stakeholders (which includes investors, employees, customers, suppliers, and the community at large). Good corporate governance helps foster a culture of integrity and leads to higher performance, ultimately contributing to economic development.

# Key Components of Corporate Governance

## Board of Directors

The board of directors is pivotal in corporate governance, responsible for making key decisions and overseeing the management's functions to ensure that the company's mission and goals are being followed.

- **Corporate Ethics**: Promoting ethical conduct and compliance with laws and regulations.
- **Financial Accountability**: Overseeing financial reporting and disclosures.

## Shareholders

Shareholders are the owners of the company and have significant influence, primarily through voting rights to elect the board of directors and approve other major corporate decisions.

- **Fair Treatment**: Ensuring all shareholders, including minority and foreign shareholders, are treated equitably.

## Management

Management, led by the CEO, is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company. The primary task is to implement the board's strategy and run the company efficiently and ethically.

### Responsibilities

- **Strategy Implementation**: Translating the board's strategic direction into actionable goals and initiatives.
- **Operations**: Managing and monitoring [business](../b/business.md) operations to ensure they are efficient and effective.
