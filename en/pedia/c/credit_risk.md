# Credit Risk

[Credit](../c/credit.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), also known as [default risk](../d/default_risk.md), is the probability that a borrower [will](../w/will.md) [fail](../f/fail.md) to meet its [obligations](../o/obligation.md) in accordance with agreed terms. This [risk](../r/risk.md) is fundamentally important to banks, financial institutions, investors, and any entity that extends [credit](../c/credit.md). The inability of a [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) to meet contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md) can lead to significant financial losses and is a central concern in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Components of Credit Risk

### Default Probability (PD)
Understanding the likelihood of a [default](../d/default.md) is critical. The [default](../d/default.md) probability is the chance that a borrower [will](../w/will.md) be unable to make the required payments. This metric is typically determined using various models, including [historical data analysis](../h/historical_data_analysis.md), [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models, and qualitative assessments.

### Loss Given Default (LGD)
Loss given [default](../d/default.md) measures the amount of loss if a [default](../d/default.md) occurs. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the total exposure that is lost when a borrower defaults. Factors influencing LGD include the [collateral](../c/collateral.md)'s [value](../v/value.md), the type of [credit](../c/credit.md) product, and the legal environment.

### Exposure at Default (EAD)
This represents the total [value](../v/value.md) exposed to a [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) at the time of [default](../d/default.md). It considers not just the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount but also any [accrued interest](../a/accrued_interest.md) and outstanding debts. For [revolving credit](../r/revolving_credit.md) facilities like [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, EAD can vary due to ongoing borrowings.

### Recovery Rate
The [recovery rate](../r/recovery_rate.md) is the percentage of the exposure that can be recovered through [collateral](../c/collateral.md) [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) or other means. High recovery rates typically [offset](../o/offset.md) [credit](../c/credit.md) losses, reducing the effective loss.

## Measuring and Managing Credit Risk

### Credit Rating Systems
[Credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies like Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch provide [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings for different entities, including governments and corporations, to help investors gauge [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). [Credit](../c/credit.md) ratings reflect the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the borrower and the likelihood of [default](../d/default.md).

### Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach
Under [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md) and III frameworks, banks are allowed to develop their own empirical models to quantify [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). The IRB approach requires banks to estimate PD, LGD, and EAD themselves, adhering to stringent regulatory standards.

### Credit Scoring Models
[Credit](../c/credit.md) scores, often employed for [consumer credit](../c/consumer_credit.md), are numerical assessments of a borrower's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). FICO scores, calculated by the Fair Isaac [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), are among the most widely used [credit](../c/credit.md) scores worldwide.

### Credit Default Swaps (CDS)
A [credit](../c/credit.md) [default](../d/default.md) [swap](../s/swap.md) is a financial [derivative](../d/derivative.md) that allows investors to [swap](../s/swap.md) [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). The buyer of a CDS receives compensation from the seller if the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) entity defaults, transferring the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).

## Tools and Techniques

### Financial Statement Analysis
Analyzing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) provides insights into a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). Key ratios—like the [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio, [interest coverage ratio](../i/interest_coverage_ratio.md), and [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) measures—help assess the ability to service [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis
[Stress testing](../s/stress_testing.md) involves evaluating the potential impact of extreme conditions on an entity's ability to meet its [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). [Scenario analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md) tests how various unforeseeable events could affect the borrower's financial stability.

### Machine Learning and AI
Advanced algorithms and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models are increasingly used to predict [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). These models can process large datasets, identifying patterns that traditional methods might miss. Companies like Zest AI ( specialize in AI-driven [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment.

### Portfolio Management
[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) helps manage [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) across a portfolio by spreading exposure across various borrowers, industries, and geographic regions. Strategic [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) mitigates the [risk](../r/risk.md) of large losses from a single [default](../d/default.md).

## Regulatory Framework

### Basel Accords
The Basel Committees on Banking Supervision have established international standards for banking regulations. [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md), II, and III outline guidelines for [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements. Key features include:

- **Minimum [Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements**: Ensuring banks [hold](../h/hold.md) a minimum amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) against their [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md).
- **Supervisory Review**: Regulatory supervision to ensure compliance and sound [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Discipline**: Enhancing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements so that [market](../m/market.md) participants can assess the riskiness of a [bank](../b/bank.md)’s assets.

### Dodd-Frank Act
The [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) enforces stricter regulations on banks and financial institutions, including [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices. It empowers regulatory agencies to oversee financial firms and imposes restrictions on [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md).

## Case Studies

### The 2008 Financial Crisis
The 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) highlighted the critical importance of [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). A significant [factor](../f/factor.md) in the crisis was the proliferation of high-[risk](../r/risk.md) [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans to subprime borrowers, which eventually defaulted in large numbers. The resulting [credit](../c/credit.md) losses led to widespread financial instability and the collapse of major financial institutions.

### European Sovereign Debt Crisis
The [European Sovereign Debt Crisis](../e/european_sovereign_debt_crisis.md) underscored the importance of assessing sovereign [credit](../c/credit.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). Countries like Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain faced high borrowing costs due to perceived [credit](../c/credit.md) risks, leading to austerity measures and financial reforms.

## Emerging Trends

### Fintech Innovations
