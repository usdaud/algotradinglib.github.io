# Investment Securities

## What are Investment Securities?

Investment securities are tradable financial assets that are purchased with the intention of generating [revenue](../r/revenue.md), either through dividends, [interest](../i/interest.md), or [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation. These securities can include a variety of financial instruments such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, mutual funds, and other related investment vehicles. The primary goal of [investing](../i/investing.md) in these securities is to accumulate [wealth](../w/wealth.md) over time while managing the associated [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Types of Investment Securities

### 1. Equities (Stocks)

Equities represent ownership in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md). When you buy a stock, you are essentially purchasing a share of the company. [Equity](../e/equity.md) securities can be broken down into several types:

- **[Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md)**: Common stockholders have voting rights in corporate decisions and may receive dividends. However, they are last in line during [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
- **[Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)**: Preferred stockholders have no voting rights but receive dividends before common stockholders and have a higher claim on assets during [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).

### 2. Fixed-Income Securities (Bonds)

Fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities are [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments that pay a fixed amount of [interest](../i/interest.md) to the [investor](../i/investor.md). Types of bonds include:

- **Government Bonds**: Issued by governments and considered very low [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Corporate Bonds**: Issued by companies and carry more [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to government bonds.
- **[Municipal Bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md)**: Issued by states, cities, or other local government entities.

### 3. Mutual Funds and ETFs

- **Mutual Funds**: These are investment vehicles that pool together [money](../m/money.md) from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of securities managed by professional [fund](../f/fund.md) managers.
- **ETFs ([Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds)**: ETFs are similar to mutual funds but are traded on stock exchanges like individual [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### 4. Derivatives

[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial contracts whose [value](../v/value.md) is dependent on the [value](../v/value.md) of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Common types include:

- **[Futures](../f/futures.md)**: Contracts to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a future date and price.
- **[Options](../o/options.md)**: Contracts that give the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a set price.
- **Swaps**: Contracts to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) cash flows or other financial instruments.

### 5. Other Investment Vehicles

There are several other forms of investment securities such as:

- **Treasury Securities**: Issued by the Department of Treasury.
- **Convertible Securities**: These can be converted into another form of [security](../s/security.md), usually [shares](../s/shares.md) of the issuing company.
- **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment Trusts (REITs)**: Companies that own, operate, or [finance](../f/finance.md) [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) assets.

## Key Concepts in Investment Securities

### 1. Diversification

[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) involves spreading investments across various types of securities and [asset](../a/asset.md) classes to minimize [risk](../r/risk.md). The idea is that a diversified portfolio [will](../w/will.md), on average, [yield](../y/yield.md) higher returns and pose a lower [risk](../r/risk.md) than any individual investment within the portfolio.

### 2. Risk and Return

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md)**: The potential for losing [money](../m/money.md) in an investment.
- **[Return](../r/return.md)**: The [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss generated from an investment over a specific period.

Investors must evaluate their [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and match it with potential returns when choosing investment securities.

### 3. Liquidity

[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) refers to the ease with which an [asset](../a/asset.md) can be converted into cash without affecting its price. [Liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets like [stocks](../s/stock.md) and ETFs are easily tradable, whereas assets like [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) may take longer to sell.

### 4. Time Horizon

The [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md) is the expected time frame an [investor](../i/investor.md) plans to [hold](../h/hold.md) an investment before taking the [money](../m/money.md) out. [Long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md) might include [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds, while [short-term investments](../s/short-term_investments.md) could be more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets like [money market](../m/money_market.md) instruments.

### 5. Market Conditions & Economic Indicators

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: [Market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and trends can impact the [value](../v/value.md) of investment securities. It's essential to stay informed about [market](../m/market.md) developments.
- **[Economic Indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md)**: Factors such as [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) can influence investment performance.
