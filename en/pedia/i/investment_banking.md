# Investment Banking

Investment banking is a segment of the financial services [industry](../i/industry.md) that focuses on helping individuals, corporations, and governments raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and execute complex financial transactions. They perform a variety of roles, from advising on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to managing initial public offerings (IPOs) and [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md).

## Overview

Investment banking is often subdivided into two primary sectors, namely the sell side and the buy side. The sell side typically involves trading securities for cash or other securities, as well as the promotion of securities. Activities on the sell side include [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md), research, and [market](../m/market.md)-making. The buy side, in contrast, deals with advising institutions concerned with buying investment services. This includes entities such as mutual funds, pension funds, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, and [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) desks.

[Investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) play several critical roles that include:

1. **[Underwriting](../u/underwriting.md)**: [Underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) involves assessing the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with a new issuance of securities. They help their clients raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds to the public or to private investors.
   
2. **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)**: [Investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) [offer](../o/offer.md) strategic advice on mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, and other significant financial transactions. They help companies identify potential targets for [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), [value](../v/value.md) these targets, and execute the transactions.

3. **Sales and Trading**: This is where the buy and sell orders are executed for institutional and retail clients. It also includes trading the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s own [capital](../c/capital.md) as [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md).
   
4. **Research**: Providing [equity research](../e/equity_research.md) and advice in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sectors helps clients make informed investment decisions. Analysts evaluate companies and sectors, rate securities, and provide insights into [market](../m/market.md) trends.

5. **[Asset Management](../a/asset_management.md)**: Some [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) also provide [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) services for individuals and institutions, managing investments on behalf of their clients.

6. **[Structured Finance](../s/structured_finance.md)**: This involves creating complex financial products designed to meet specific needs, such as [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities, [asset](../a/asset.md)-backed securities, and [credit](../c/credit.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).
