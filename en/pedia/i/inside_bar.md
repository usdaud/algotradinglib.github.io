# Inside Bar

An inside bar is a price bar whose high and low are fully within the range of the previous bar. It signals consolidation and reduced volatility.

## Interpretation
Inside bars often represent a pause in momentum. Traders look for a breakout above the inside bar high or below its low to confirm direction.

## Example
A strong uptrend prints a wide bar. The next bar is smaller and stays inside the prior range. A breakout above the inside bar can be used as a continuation entry.

## Variations
Multiple inside bars in a row form an inside bar pattern and often precede a larger move. The longer the compression, the stronger the potential breakout.

## Risks
False breakouts are common in choppy markets. Combining inside bars with trend context improves reliability.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Inside Bar and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Inside Bar as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Inside Bar, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Inside Bar. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Inside Bar alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
