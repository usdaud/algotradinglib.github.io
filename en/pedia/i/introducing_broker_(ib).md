# Introducing Broker (IB)

An Introducing [Broker](../b/broker.md) (IB) plays a crucial role in the multi-faceted world of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), acting as an intermediary between clients and brokers. This concept, while relatively straightforward on the surface, encompasses numerous facets that are critical for understanding the broader landscape of financial brokerage and trading.

An IB is essentially an individual or a company that introduces clients to a brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) while earning a [commission](../c/commission.md) or [fee](../f/fee.md) for this service. Unlike full-service brokers, IBs do not take orders from clients or [handle](../h/handle.md) client funds. Instead, they focus on advising clients on suitable brokerage firms and [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), often specializing in areas such as [futures](../f/futures.md), [options](../o/options.md), and forex, as well as equities and other financial instruments.

## Functions of an Introducing Broker
