# Intermediate Good

## Definition
**Intermediate Good** refers to a product that is used as an input in the production of final goods or services. These goods undergo further processing, transformation, or assembly before becoming finished products ready for consumption or [sale](../s/sale.md).

## Key Components
1. **Input for Production**: Intermediate goods are essential components or [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) used in the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) process to produce final goods.
2. **Further Processing**: These goods require additional processing or assembly to become part of a finished product.
3. **Economic Contribution**: Intermediate goods contribute to the [value](../v/value.md)-added process in various industries.

## Importance
1. **Economic Measurement**: Intermediate goods are critical for calculating Gross Domestic Product (GDP), where only the [value](../v/value.md) of final goods and services is counted to avoid double-counting.
2. **[Supply Chain](../s/supply_chain.md)**: They play a vital role in the [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md), connecting raw material suppliers to manufacturers and final goods producers.
3. **Cost Structure**: The cost and availability of intermediate goods affect the pricing, [production efficiency](../p/production_efficiency.md), and profitability of final goods.

## Examples of Intermediate Goods
1. **Automotive [Industry](../i/industry.md)**: Car engines, tires, and batteries used in the assembly of automobiles.
2. **Electronics**: Microchips, circuit boards, and displays used in the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) of computers and smartphones.
3. **Construction**: Steel beams, cement, and insulation materials used in building construction.
4. **Textiles**: Fabrics, dyes, and zippers used in the production of clothing and apparel.

## Example Scenarios
1. **[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md)**: A company producing televisions purchases screens, electronic components, and plastic casings as intermediate goods.
2. **Food Production**: A bakery uses flour, sugar, and butter as intermediate goods to produce bread and pastries.
3. **Automobile Assembly**: An automotive manufacturer buys engines, transmissions, and tires to assemble complete vehicles.

## Challenges
1. **Price [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: The prices of intermediate goods can fluctuate due to changes in raw material costs, affecting the [production costs](../p/production_costs.md) of final goods.
2. **[Supply Chain](../s/supply_chain.md) Disruptions**: Disruptions in the [supply](../s/supply.md) of intermediate goods can halt production processes, leading to delays and increased costs.
3. **[Quality Control](../q/quality_control.md)**: Ensuring the consistent quality of intermediate goods is crucial for maintaining the quality of the final products.

## Best Practices
1. **Diversified Suppliers**: Maintaining a diverse supplier base can mitigate risks associated with [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) disruptions.
2. **Cost Management**: Implementing effective cost management strategies to [handle](../h/handle.md) price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and maintain profitability.
3. **Quality [Assurance](../a/assurance.md)**: Establishing strict [quality control](../q/quality_control.md) measures to ensure the reliability and performance of intermediate goods.

## Conclusion
Intermediate goods are essential components in the production of final goods and services, playing a crucial role in the [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) and economic processes. Understanding their importance, managing challenges, and implementing [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) can enhance [production efficiency](../p/production_efficiency.md) and contribute to [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Intermediate Good and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Intermediate Good as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Intermediate Good, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Intermediate Good. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.
