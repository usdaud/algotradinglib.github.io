# Iso Costing

Iso costing refers to the use of iso cost lines to analyze production choices and cost minimization. An iso cost line represents all combinations of two inputs that produce the same total cost.

## Basic formula
Total Cost = (Price of Labor * Labor) + (Price of Capital * Capital)

This formula defines a straight line in input space. A firm seeks the lowest cost line that still reaches a desired output level.

## Why it matters
Iso costing helps compare the cost efficiency of different input mixes. It is widely used in microeconomics and managerial decision making.

## Example
If labor costs 20 per unit and capital costs 10 per unit, then a total cost of 200 can be achieved with 10 units of labor and 0 units of capital, or 0 units of labor and 20 units of capital, or any combination on the line.

## Practical notes
Iso cost analysis is often paired with isoquant analysis to identify optimal input choices.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Iso Costing and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Iso Costing as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Iso Costing, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Iso Costing. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Iso Costing alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
