# Interbank Market

The interbank [market](../m/market.md) is a critical component of the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). It is a [market](../m/market.md) where banks and financial institutions engage in short-term borrowing and lending with one another, primarily to manage [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and meet regulatory requirements. This [market](../m/market.md) operates over-the-counter (OTC) and is crucial for the functioning of the banking system, as it ensures that banks can fulfill their short-term funding needs and maintain [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) stability. Here, we [will](../w/will.md) explore various aspects of the interbank [market](../m/market.md), including its structure, participants, instruments, and the role it plays in the broader [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

## Structure of the Interbank Market

The interbank [market](../m/market.md) is decentralized, operating on a global scale without a single [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) or [exchange](../e/exchange.md). Transactions in this [market](../m/market.md) are conducted directly between banks through various communication channels, such as telephone, electronic trading platforms, and [broker-dealer](../b/broker-dealer.md) networks. Key features of the interbank [market](../m/market.md) include:

- **Decentralization**: There is no central location or [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for interbank trading, making it highly flexible and accessible for participants worldwide.
- **OTC [Market](../m/market.md)**: Transactions are conducted over-the-counter, meaning they are negotiated directly between parties rather than through a centralized [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
- **Short-term Focus**: Most transactions in the interbank [market](../m/market.md) are short-term, ranging from overnight to a few weeks, although longer-term transactions can also occur.

## Participants in the Interbank Market

The primary participants in the interbank [market](../m/market.md) are commercial banks, central banks, and other financial institutions. Each participant plays a unique role in the [market](../m/market.md):

- **Commercial Banks**: These are the main participants in the interbank [market](../m/market.md). They engage in borrowing and lending activities to manage their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), meet [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md), and optimize their balance sheets.
- **Central Banks**: Central banks participate in the interbank [market](../m/market.md) to implement [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), manage [currency](../c/currency.md) reserves, and provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the banking system. They often act as lenders of last resort.
- **[Investment Banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) and Financial Institutions**: These institutions participate in the interbank [market](../m/market.md) to manage their short-term funding needs, execute [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md).

## Instruments Traded in the Interbank Market

Several financial instruments are commonly traded in the interbank [market](../m/market.md). These instruments vary in terms of [maturity](../m/maturity.md), [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md). The most common instruments include:

- **Interbank Loans**: Short-term unsecured loans between banks, typically with maturities ranging from overnight to one year. These loans are often based on interbank offered rates such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) or EURIBOR ([Euro](../e/euro.md) Interbank Offered Rate).
- **Certificates of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) (CDs)**: Time deposits issued by banks with specific maturities and fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. CDs can be traded in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md), providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to banks.
- **Repurchase Agreements (Repos)**: Short-term borrowing agreements where banks sell securities and agree to repurchase them at a later date, usually at a higher price. This provides a secured form of borrowing and lending.
- **[Foreign Exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) (FX) Swaps**: Contracts in which two parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) currencies for a specified period and agree to reverse the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) at a predetermined rate on the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md). These are used to manage [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
- **[Forward Rate](../f/forward_rate.md) Agreements (FRAs)**: Contracts that allow banks to lock in an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for a future period, helping them [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations.

## Role of the Interbank Market in the Financial System

The interbank [market](../m/market.md) plays a crucial role in the stability and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). Its primary functions include:

- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Management**: The interbank [market](../m/market.md) allows banks to manage short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) needs by borrowing and lending funds among themselves. This helps maintain the smooth functioning of the banking system and prevents [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) shortages.
- **[Monetary Policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) Implementation**: Central banks use the interbank [market](../m/market.md) to implement [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). By influencing interbank [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, central banks can affect overall monetary conditions, including [credit](../c/credit.md) availability, [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).
- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Benchmarking**: Interbank offered rates, such as LIBOR and EURIBOR, serve as benchmarks for various financial instruments, including loans, mortgages, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). These rates are critical for pricing and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Banks use the interbank [market](../m/market.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and [currency](../c/currency.md) risks. By engaging in various financial instruments, they can mitigate potential losses from [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations.
- **Financial Stability**: A well-functioning interbank [market](../m/market.md) contributes to the overall stability of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). It ensures that banks can access short-term funding, reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [bank](../b/bank.md) failures, and enhances confidence in the banking system.

## Evolution and Regulation of the Interbank Market

The interbank [market](../m/market.md) has evolved significantly over the years, influenced by changes in technology, regulation, and [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). Key developments include:

- **Technological Advancements**: The adoption of electronic trading platforms and communication networks has increased the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) of the interbank [market](../m/market.md). These advancements have reduced [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and improved [market](../m/market.md) accessibility.
- **Regulatory Changes**: The global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2008 prompted significant regulatory changes to enhance the stability of the interbank [market](../m/market.md). Regulatory reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and the [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) framework, have introduced stricter [capital](../c/capital.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements for banks.
- **[Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Rate Reforms**: Concerns about the manipulation of interbank offered rates, such as LIBOR, have led to substantial reforms. Alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate (SOFR) in the United States and the [Euro](../e/euro.md) Short-Term Rate (€STR) in the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md), have been introduced to replace traditional benchmarks.

## Case Study: The LIBOR Scandal

One of the most significant events in the history of the interbank [market](../m/market.md) is the [LIBOR scandal](../l/libor_scandal.md). LIBOR, a widely used [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), was found to be manipulated by several major banks. This case study highlights the importance of [transparency](../t/transparency.md), regulation, and [trust](../t/trust.md) in the interbank [market](../m/market.md).

- **Background**: LIBOR, which stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate, was used to set [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for trillions of dollars' worth of financial contracts, including mortgages, loans, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).
- **Manipulation**: In the late 2000s, it was discovered that several major banks had been manipulating LIBOR submissions to benefit their trading positions and appear more financially stable. This manipulation undermined the integrity of the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate.
- **Investigations and Consequences**: Regulatory authorities in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) countries conducted investigations, leading to significant fines and penalties for the involved banks. The scandal prompted a move towards more transparent and reliable [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates.
- **Reforms**: In response to the scandal, efforts were made to develop alternative reference rates, such as SOFR and €STR, which are based on actual [transaction](../t/transaction.md) data rather than estimates. These reforms aim to restore [trust](../t/trust.md) in [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates and enhance [market](../m/market.md) stability.

## Real-world Examples of Interbank Market Participants

Several prominent banks and financial institutions actively participate in the interbank [market](../m/market.md), managing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and executing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Some examples include:
