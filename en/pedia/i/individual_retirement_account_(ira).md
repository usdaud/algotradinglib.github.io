# Individual Retirement Account (IRA)

An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a type of [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) designed to help individuals save for retirement. It offers tax advantages that make it easier for people to accumulate retirement savings. There are several types of IRAs, each with its own unique features and benefits. Understanding these differences is crucial for making informed investment decisions.

## Types of IRAs

### Traditional IRA

A [Traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) is a retirement [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) that allows individuals to contribute pre-tax [income](../i/income.md) toward investments that can grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md). Contributions to a [Traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) may be tax-deductible, depending on the individual's [income](../i/income.md) level and participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans.

#### Key Features:
1. **Tax Deductibility**: Contributions may be tax-deductible.
2. **[Tax-Deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) Growth**: Investments grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) until [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md).
3. **Contribution Limits**: The annual contribution limit for 2023 is $6,000, or $7,000 for those aged 50 or older.
4. **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Withdrawals must begin at age 72.

#### Advantages:
- Immediate tax benefits through potential deductions.
- [Tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) growth can lead to significant gains over time.

#### Disadvantages:
- Mandatory withdrawals starting at age 72.
- Withdrawals are taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md).

### Roth IRA

A [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) is a retirement account where contributions are made with after-tax dollars. While contributions are not tax-deductible, withdrawals during retirement are generally [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md), provided certain conditions are met.

#### Key Features:
1. **[Tax-Free](../t/tax_free.md) Withdrawals**: Qualified distributions are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md).
2. **Contribution Limits**: The same as Traditional IRAs, $6,000 annually or $7,000 for those aged 50+.
3. **[Income](../i/income.md) Limits**: Contributions are limited based on [income](../i/income.md).
4. **No RMDs**: No required minimum withdrawals during the account holder's lifetime.

#### Advantages:
- [Tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) growth and withdrawals.
- No RMDs, providing more flexibility in retirement.

#### Disadvantages:
- No immediate tax benefits; contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
- [Income](../i/income.md) restrictions limit eligibility.

### SEP IRA

A SEP (Simplified Employee Pension) IRA is designed for self-employed individuals and small [business](../b/business.md) owners. It allows employers to contribute to traditional IRAs set up for employees, including themselves.

#### Key Features:
1. **High Contribution Limits**: Up to 25% of compensation or $66,000 for 2023, whichever is less.
2. **Tax Deductibility**: Contributions are tax-deductible for the [business](../b/business.md).
3. **Flexibility**: Employers do not need to contribute every year.

#### Advantages:
- Significantly higher contribution limits.
- Simple administration and tax-deductible contributions.

#### Disadvantages:
- Employer must contribute an equal percentage for all eligible employees.
- No catch-up contributions for those aged 50+.

### SIMPLE IRA

A SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) IRA is a retirement plan that allows small businesses with 100 or fewer employees to contribute to their employees' retirement savings.

#### Key Features:
1. **Employee and Employer Contributions**: Both employee deferrals and employer contributions are allowed.
2. **Contribution Limits**: Employees can defer up to $15,500 annually, plus $3,500 catch-up if age 50 or older (2023 limits).
3. **Employer Matching**: Mandatory employer contributions or non-elective contributions.

#### Advantages:
- Easy to set up and maintain.
- Contributions are tax-deductible for the [business](../b/business.md).

#### Disadvantages:
- Lower contribution limits compared to other plans like SEP IRAs.
- Mandatory employer contributions.

## Investment Options

IRAs provide a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md), allowing account holders to build a diversified portfolio suitable for their [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and retirement goals.

### Common Investment Options:
1. **[Stocks](../s/stock.md)**: [Equity](../e/equity.md) investments [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for high returns but come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md).
2. **Bonds**: [Fixed income securities](../f/fixed_income_securities.md) provide more stability and regular [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.
3. **Mutual Funds**: Pooled investment funds managed by professionals.
4. **ETFs**: [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds [offer](../o/offer.md) [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and can be traded like [stocks](../s/stock.md).
5. **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md)**: Including REITs ([Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment Trusts).
6. **Certificates of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) (CDs)**: Low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments with fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Tax Considerations

### Contribution Phase

#### Traditional IRA:
- Contributions may lower [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) if deductible.
- Phase-out limits for deductibility based on [income](../i/income.md) and retirement plan coverage.

#### Roth IRA:
- Contributions are made with [after-tax income](../a/after-tax_income.md).
- [Income](../i/income.md) limits determine eligibility.

### Withdrawal Phase

#### Traditional IRA:
- Withdrawals taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md).
- Penalties apply for withdrawals before age 59½, with some exceptions.
- RMDs required starting at age 72.

#### Roth IRA:
- Qualified withdrawals are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md).
- Contributions can be withdrawn any time without penalty.
- No RMDs during the account holder's lifetime.

## Strategies for Maximizing Benefits

### Start Early

Taking advantage of [compound interest](../c/compound_interest_in_trading.md) by starting contributions early can significantly enhance the growth of retirement savings.

### Diversify Investments

A diversified portfolio reduces [risk](../r/risk.md) and can provide more stable returns over time.

### Maximize Contributions

Making the maximum allowable contributions each year can help build a substantial retirement [nest egg](../n/nest_egg.md).

### Monitor and Adjust

Regularly reviewing and adjusting investment choices based on performance and changing financial goals is essential.

### Roth Conversions

Converting a [Traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) to a [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) can make sense for some, especially if they expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

Several financial institutions [offer](../o/offer.md) IRA accounts with different features and services. Here are links to some prominent providers:
