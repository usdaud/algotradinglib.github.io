# Indicated Price

The indicated price is a preliminary price estimate shown by an exchange or trading system before an auction or opening. It reflects the price at which the most shares would execute if the auction occurred at that moment.

## Where it appears
- Opening auctions for equities.
- Closing auctions or special crosses.
- Some futures and options markets during pre open periods.

## Interpretation
Traders use the indicated price to gauge likely opening levels and to decide whether to add, cancel, or modify orders.

## Example
Before the open, the indicated price for a stock is shown at 102, above the prior close of 99. Traders infer a positive gap and adjust risk.

## Limitations
The indicated price can move quickly and may differ from the final auction price if orders change.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Indicated Price and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Indicated Price as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Indicated Price, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Indicated Price. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Indicated Price alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
