# Insider Trading Patterns

[Insider trading](../i/insider.md) refers to the buying or selling of a publicly traded company’s stock by individuals with access to non-public information about the company. Insiders include major shareholders, executives, directors, and any other individual or entity that obtains non-public information regarding the company. When done lawfully, [insider trading](../i/insider.md) is legitimate; however, illegal [insider trading](../i/insider.md) involves the abuse of this privileged access to confidential information for personal [gain](../g/gain.md), leading to severe penalties and criminal charges.

## Introduction to Insider Trading

[Insider trading](../i/insider.md) first gained recognition during the early 20th century, as markets began to formalize. Over the decades, various regulatory frameworks have been established to detect and deter illicit [insider trading](../i/insider.md) activities. The primary regulatory body in the United States overseeing [insider trading](../i/insider.md) is the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC).

## Legal Insider Trading

Not all [insider trading](../i/insider.md) is illegal. Legal [insider trading](../i/insider.md) occurs when corporate insiders—officers, directors, and employees—buy and sell stock in their own companies. These transactions must be reported to the SEC, which ensures [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and fairness. Insiders are required to file a [Form 4](../f/form_4.md) within two [business](../b/business.md) days of a [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

### Types of Legal Insider Trading

1. **Planned Trading Programs ([Rule 10b5-1](../r/rule_10b5-1.md) Plans)**: These are pre-determined trading plans allowed by the SEC, which enable insiders to sell a predetermined number of [shares](../s/shares.md) at regular intervals.

2. **Closed Periods**: These are specific time periods during which insiders cannot [trade](../t/trade.md) their company’s stock to prevent conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md).

3. **[Open Market](../o/open_market.md) Purchases**: Insiders can buy stock on the [open market](../o/open_market.md) as long as they comply with the SEC regulations.

## Illegal Insider Trading

Illegal [insider trading](../i/insider.md) occurs when insiders [trade](../t/trade.md) based on non-public, material information. This kind of trading is detrimental to [market](../m/market.md) integrity as it unfairly advantages insiders over regular investors. The SEC has stringent rules to combat illegal [insider trading](../i/insider.md), incorporating surveillance and advanced analytics for detection.

### Examples of Illegal Insider Trading

1. **High-profile Cases**: Several high-profile cases have made headlines, including those involving prominent figures such as Martha Stewart and Raj Rajaratnam, showcasing the severe ramifications of illegal [insider trading](../i/insider.md).
2. **Tipping**: Passing non-public information to another individual (tipping) who then makes a [trade](../t/trade.md) also constitutes illegal [insider trading](../i/insider.md).

## Patterns and Analytics in Insider Trading

### Detection Patterns

Detecting [insider trading](../i/insider.md) patterns involves sophisticated analytics and surveillance. Regulators and private firms use various techniques, including:

1. **[Data Mining](../d/data_mining.md)**: Scanning vast datasets for [unusual trading patterns](../u/unusual_trading_patterns.md).
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Assessing trading behaviors that deviate from normal patterns during significant news events.
3. **[Network Analysis](../n/network_analysis_in_trading.md)**: Identifying potential networks of connected individuals who may be exchanging non-public information.

Unusual spikes in trading volumes or significant price movements preceding corporate announcements can signal potential [insider trading](../i/insider.md). Understanding these patterns helps regulators to pinpoint suspicious activities.

### Statistical Models

Advanced statistical models are used to detect possible [insider trading](../i/insider.md). These models analyze:

1. **Probability Models**: Evaluating the likelihood of unusual trading activity based on historical patterns.
2. **Machine [Learning Algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md)**: Utilizing AI to predict and flag transactions that may involve insider information.

## Regulatory Measures and Compliance

2. **[Insider Trading](../i/insider.md) and Securities [Fraud](../f/fraud.md) Enforcement Act of 1988**: Enhances penalties and enforcement for [insider trading](../i/insider.md) violations.
3. **[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](../s/sarbanes-oxley_(sox)_act_of_2002.md)**: Implements stringent [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements to prevent corporate [fraud](../f/fraud.md).
