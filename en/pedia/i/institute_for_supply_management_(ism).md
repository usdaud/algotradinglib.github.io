# Institute for Supply Management (ISM)

The Institute for [Supply](../s/supply.md) Management (ISM) is a non-[profit](../p/profit.md) organization that is responsible for the establishment and dissemination of standards and research in the field of [supply](../s/supply.md) management. It is one of the most respected and well-known professional organizations dedicated to advancing the practice of [supply](../s/supply.md) management and [procurement](../p/procurement.md) globally. ISM is particularly recognized for its influential and widely followed ISM [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) and Non-[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) indices, which are critical indicators of economic health used by [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and policymakers.

## History and Background

### Foundation and Evolution

ISM was founded in 1915, initially as the National Association of Purchasing Agents (NAPA). Over the years, it has transformed and expanded its mission to include all aspects of [supply](../s/supply.md) management. The organization was renamed the Institute for [Supply](../s/supply.md) Management in 2002 to reflect this broader focus.

### Mission and Objectives

ISM's mission is to lead the [supply](../s/supply.md) management profession globally by setting standards, providing certification, and [offering](../o/offering.md) education and research. Its primary objectives include:

1. **Advancing the Profession:** Through the [provision](../p/provision.md) of professional certification programs like the Certified Professional in [Supply](../s/supply.md) Management (CPSM).
2. **Research and Innovation:** Conducting extensive research to release reports that are insightful and timely, thus setting benchmarks in the [industry](../i/industry.md).
3. **Education and Training:** [Offering](../o/offering.md) a variety of courses, workshops, and seminars to enhance the professional competency of [supply](../s/supply.md) managers.

## Major Contributions

### ISM Manufacturing Index (PMI)

The [ISM Manufacturing Index](../i/ism_manufacturing_index.md), also known as the Purchasing Managers' [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (PMI), is an [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) derived from monthly surveys of [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) companies in the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) sector. It is based on five major indicators: new orders, [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels, production, supplier deliveries, and employment environment. The PMI provides valuable information about current and future [business](../b/business.md) conditions to company decision-makers, analysts, and investors. A PMI above 50 represents [expansion](../e/expansion.md), whereas a PMI below 50 represents contraction.

### ISM Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI)

Similar to the [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) PMI, the ISM Non-[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md), or NMI, surveys the non-[manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) sector and is a crucial [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md). Introduced later than the [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) PMI, the NMI serves to gauge [business](../b/business.md) activity in the [service sector](../s/service_sector.md). It includes categories such as [business](../b/business.md) activity, new orders, employment, and supplier deliveries.

### Certification Programs

ISM offers prestigious certifications that are recognized globally:

1. **Certified Professional in [Supply](../s/supply.md) Management (CPSM):** A comprehensive credential that covers all aspects of [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management.
2. **Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD):** Focuses on diversity in the [supply](../s/supply.md) base, a crucial aspect of modern [procurement](../p/procurement.md).
3. **Accredited Purchasing Practitioner (APP):** Aimed at enhancing the skills and knowledge of purchasing professionals.

## ISM and Algorithmic Trading

### Economic Indicators and Market Movements

ISM’s indices are highly regarded by the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) due to their ability to predict economic expansions and contractions. Traders, especially those utilizing [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md), closely monitor these indices for their implications on [market](../m/market.md) movements. [Real-time data analysis](../r/real-time_data_analysis.md) and algorithmic models can swiftly interpret the release of ISM reports, adjusting [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) accordingly.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

In the realm of high-frequency trading (HFT), the quick interpretation and reaction to [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) like ISM’s PMI can [offer](../o/offer.md) substantial trading advantages. Algorithms are designed to parse the ISM data releases, often within milliseconds, executing trades based on historical correlations between the indices and various [asset](../a/asset.md) prices.

### Sentiment Analysis

ISM reports contribute to [market sentiment analysis](../m/market_sentiment_analysis.md). Algorithms employing [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP) can scan the qualitative parts of ISM reports, extracting sentiment and aligning it with quantitative data to form comprehensive [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Key ISM Reports

1. **[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Report On [Business](../b/business.md)®:** Provides insights into the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) sector’s performance.
2. **Non-[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Report On [Business](../b/business.md)®:** Offers a detailed view of the [service sector](../s/service_sector.md).

Both reports are released on a monthly [basis](../b/basis.md) and are eagerly anticipated by [market](../m/market.md) participants. For more in-depth exploration, the ISM online platform provides access to these reports and additional resources:
