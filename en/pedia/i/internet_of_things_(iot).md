This is the layer where data is collected. It includes all the sensors and actuators embedded in IoT devices.

### 2. Network Layer

This layer facilitates communication between devices and servers. It can use different communication protocols, such as HTTP, MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), or CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol).

### 3. Processing Layer

This is where data from IoT devices is processed. It involves analytics, [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), and data storage. This layer can be implemented using edge computing, [cloud computing](../c/cloud_computing_in_trading.md), or a hybrid approach.

### 4. Application Layer

This layer is where users interact with the IoT system. It includes the user interface and can also incorporate APIs that allow other systems to interact with the IoT data.

## Applications of IoT

IoT has a wide [range](../r/range.md) of applications, transforming various industries in the process.
