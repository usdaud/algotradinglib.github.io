# Incremental Cost of Capital

## Introduction
The [incremental cost](../i/incremental_cost.md) of [capital](../c/capital.md) (ICC) is a financial metric used to measure the cost of obtaining additional [capital](../c/capital.md). This metric is crucial for businesses as it helps in decision-making regarding [financing](../f/financing.md) [options](../o/options.md) for new projects or expansions. Understanding ICC involves delving into various financial concepts like [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md), [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md), [cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md), and the [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) (WACC).

## Basic Concept
The [incremental cost](../i/incremental_cost.md) of [capital](../c/capital.md) reflects the cost a company incurs to obtain an additional unit of new [capital](../c/capital.md). This could involve issuing new [debt](../d/debt.md), [equity](../e/equity.md), or a combination of both. It’s different from the average [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), which encompasses the cost of all [capital](../c/capital.md) raised by the company so far. ICC focuses on the cost of future [capital](../c/capital.md), aiding managers in making prudent investment decisions.

## Components of ICC

### 1. Cost of Equity
The [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) is the [return](../r/return.md) that [equity](../e/equity.md) investors expect for their investment in the company. Several models are used to calculate this, including:

- **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Discount](../d/discount.md) Model (DDM)**
- **[Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM)**

### 2. Cost of Debt
The [cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md) is the effective rate a company pays on its borrowed funds. This can be calculated using the [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) (YTM) on the existing [debt](../d/debt.md) or the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on new [debt](../d/debt.md). The [cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md) needs to be adjusted for tax benefits, as [interest](../i/interest.md) expenses are tax-deductible.

### 3. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
The WACC is the average [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) a company must earn on its assets to maintain its current [value](../v/value.md) and satisfy its stakeholders. The formula for WACC is:

```
WACC = (E/V * Re) + ((D/V * Rd) * (1-T))
```

Where:
- E = [Market value of equity](../m/market_value_of_equity.md)
- D = [Market value](../m/market_value.md) of [debt](../d/debt.md)
- V = Total [market value of equity](../m/market_value_of_equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md)
- Re = [Cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md)
- Rd = [Cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md)
- T = [Corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rate

## Calculation of Incremental Cost of Capital
Calculating the ICC involves assessing the costs involved in raising new [capital](../c/capital.md). This can include:

1. **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Issuance Costs:**
 - [Underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) Fees
 - Legal Expenses
 - Registration Fees
2. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Issuance Costs:**
 - [Underwriting Spread](../u/underwriting_spread.md)
 - [Bank](../b/bank.md) Fees
 - Legal and Administrative Costs

## Real-World Application
Businesses use ICC to evaluate investment opportunities. If the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) on a new project exceeds the ICC, the project could be considered viable. Conversely, if the [return](../r/return.md) is less than the ICC, the project may not be a wise investment.

### Examples:

- **Tech Startups:**
 Tech companies often face high ICC due to the perceived [risk](../r/risk.md) by investors. These companies must ensure that their projected returns justify the high [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md).

- **[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Firms:**
 Established [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) firms usually have lower ICC as they are seen as less risky. They can [finance](../f/finance.md) new projects using [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) or low-cost [debt](../d/debt.md).

## ICC in Financial Analysis
Analysts extensively use ICC to gauge a company’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). High ICC might indicate a risky or poorly managed company, while low ICC suggests a stable and efficiently managed enterprise.

## Conclusion
Understanding [incremental cost](../i/incremental_cost.md) of [capital](../c/capital.md) is essential for making informed financial decisions and maintaining a sound [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md). By carefully assessing ICC, companies can optimize their investment strategies and enhance [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).
