# Invoice Financing

[Invoice](../i/invoice.md) [financing](../f/financing.md), also known as [invoice](../i/invoice.md) trading or [accounts receivable financing](../a/accounts_receivable_financing.md), is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) used by businesses to manage their [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) by borrowing against their accounts receivables. This technique allows companies to unlock working [capital](../c/capital.md) that is tied up in unpaid invoices, ensuring a smoother [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) management process and quicker access to funds necessary for operations and growth.

## How Invoice Financing Works

[Invoice](../i/invoice.md) [financing](../f/financing.md) involves selling your invoices to a [third party](../t/third_party.md) (a financier or [invoice](../i/invoice.md) factoring company) at a [discount](../d/discount.md). The financier provides an advance (usually a percentage of the [invoice](../i/invoice.md) [value](../v/value.md)) to the [business](../b/business.md) while retaining a portion of the [invoice](../i/invoice.md) as a [fee](../f/fee.md) or reserve. Once the end [customer](../c/customer.md) pays the [invoice](../i/invoice.md), the financier releases the remaining amount minus their [fee](../f/fee.md).

### Types of Invoice Financing

1. **[Invoice](../i/invoice.md) Factoring**: This is the most common form of [invoice](../i/invoice.md) [financing](../f/financing.md) where a [business](../b/business.md) sells its invoices to a factoring company at a [discount](../d/discount.md). The factoring company takes on the responsibility of collecting [payment](../p/payment.md) from the end [customer](../c/customer.md).
2. **[Invoice](../i/invoice.md) [Discounting](../d/discounting.md)**: Unlike factoring, in [invoice](../i/invoice.md) [discounting](../d/discounting.md), the [business](../b/business.md) retains control over its sales ledger and the responsibility for collecting payments. The financier lends [money](../m/money.md) against the [value](../v/value.md) of the invoices, but the [business](../b/business.md) continues to chase [invoice](../i/invoice.md) payments.
3. **Selective [Invoice](../i/invoice.md) [Financing](../f/financing.md)**: Companies can choose individual invoices to [finance](../f/finance.md) rather than selling all invoices to the financier. This selective approach provides flexibility and control over [financing](../f/financing.md) costs.

## The Invoice Financing Process

1. **Agreement**: The [business](../b/business.md) enters into a contract with an [invoice](../i/invoice.md) [financing](../f/financing.md) company.
2. **Submission**: The [business](../b/business.md) submits outstanding invoices to the financier.
3. **Advance**: The financier provides an advance, typically ranging from 70% to 90% of the [invoice](../i/invoice.md) [value](../v/value.md).
4. **Collection**: The financier or the [business](../b/business.md) (depending on the type of [invoice](../i/invoice.md) [financing](../f/financing.md)) collects [payment](../p/payment.md) from the end [customer](../c/customer.md).
5. **Settlement**: Once the [invoice](../i/invoice.md) is paid, the financier releases the remaining balance minus the agreed-upon fees.

## Advantages of Invoice Financing

1. **Improved [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)**: Businesses get immediate access to cash, providing [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and the ability to meet urgent financial requirements without waiting for [payment](../p/payment.md) terms.
2. **Flexibility and Speed**: [Invoice](../i/invoice.md) [financing](../f/financing.md) is generally faster than traditional [bank](../b/bank.md) loans and offers flexibility in terms of [financing](../f/financing.md) amounts based on the [value](../v/value.md) of invoices.
3. **No [Collateral](../c/collateral.md) Required**: As [financing](../f/financing.md) is based on outstanding invoices, businesses are not required to provide additional [collateral](../c/collateral.md).
4. **Outsourced Collections**: In the case of [invoice](../i/invoice.md) factoring, the responsibility for collecting payments shifts to the financier, allowing businesses to focus on core operations.

## Disadvantages of Invoice Financing

1. **Costs**: [Invoice](../i/invoice.md) [financing](../f/financing.md) can be more expensive than traditional [bank](../b/bank.md) loans. Factoring fees, [discount](../d/discount.md) rates, and other charges can accumulate and reduce [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md).
2. **Impact on [Customer](../c/customer.md) Relationships**: In the case of factoring, some customers may be wary of dealing with third-party financiers or it might reflect a [business](../b/business.md)’s [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) problems.
3. **Exposure to [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Some forms of [invoice](../i/invoice.md) [financing](../f/financing.md) involve the [business](../b/business.md) bearing the [risk](../r/risk.md) if the [customer](../c/customer.md) fails to pay. This could impact the relationship with the financier and result in financial loss.
