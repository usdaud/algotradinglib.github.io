# Iran Fara Bourse (IFB)

Iran Fara Bourse (IFB) is an Iranian over-the-counter (OTC) [market](../m/market.md) for securities and other financial instruments. Established in 2008, it operates under the supervision of Iran's Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Organization (SEO) and provides a platform for securities that do not meet Tehran Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)'s (TSE) listing criteria. The IFB facilitates the trading of a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial instruments, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). This makes it a vital component of Iran's financial [market](../m/market.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startups.

## Overview

### Purpose and Operations
The IFB was established with the aim of creating a more flexible [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md). Unlike the TSE, which has stringent [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md), the IFB offers a relaxed regulatory framework that allows smaller, emerging companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). This increases [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and offers investors a broader [range](../r/range.md) of investment opportunities. The [market](../m/market.md) operates electronically and uses a fully automated trading system to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

### Regulatory Framework
Iran Fara Bourse is governed by the Securities [Market](../m/market.md) Act of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which provides it with the legal authority to operate as an OTC [market](../m/market.md). The SEO closely monitors all operations, ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, and oversees the [market](../m/market.md) to protect [investor](../i/investor.md) interests. Companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the IFB are subject to [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements, including periodic financial reporting and adherence to [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) standards.

## Market Structure

### Trading Segments
The IFB has several [market](../m/market.md) segments to accommodate various types of securities:

1. **Base [Market](../m/market.md)**: This is the [primary market](../p/primary_market.md) for trading securities that cannot be [listed](../l/listed.md) on the TSE. It includes [stocks](../s/stock.md) of smaller companies and those in recovery phases.
2. **[Secondary Market](../s/secondary_market.md)**: This [market segment](../m/market_segment.md) facilitates the trading of securities that have already been issued and provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for investors.
3. **Modern Financial Instruments [Market](../m/market.md)**: This segment deals with trading in [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), including [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) contracts.
4. **Small & Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) [Market](../m/market.md)**: Specifically designed for startups and smaller companies, this segment provides easier access to [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md).

### Trading System
IFB uses an electronic trading system known as the "Extranet System." This system provides secure, efficient, and transparent trading. It also allows for real-time data dissemination, [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), and [transaction](../t/transaction.md) processing. The electronic nature of the system minimizes the [risk](../r/risk.md) of errors and [fraud](../f/fraud.md), thereby increasing [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

### Market Participants
Participants in the IFB include individual investors, institutional investors, [broker-dealer](../b/broker-dealer.md) firms, and [market](../m/market.md) makers. These entities contribute to the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and stability of the [market](../m/market.md). [Broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers play a critical role by facilitating trades on behalf of clients and ensuring best [execution](../e/execution.md) practices.

## Financial Instruments

### Equities
[Stocks](../s/stock.md) of companies that do not meet the listing criteria of the TSE are traded on the IFB. These include [shares](../s/shares.md) of newly established firms, family-run businesses, and SMEs looking to expand.

### Fixed Income Securities
The IFB offers various fixed-[income](../i/income.md) instruments, such as corporate bonds, government bonds, and [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md). These instruments provide investors with a relatively safer investment option compared to equities.

### Derivatives
The IFB has a dedicated segment for [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) trading, including [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) contracts. These financial instruments allow investors to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) risks and speculate on price movements of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

### Sukuk
The IFB also offers Islamic financial instruments like [Sukuk](../s/sukuk.md), which comply with Sharia law. [Sukuk](../s/sukuk.md) are essentially Islamic bonds that provide returns to investors without involving [interest](../i/interest.md), in adherence to Islamic financial principles.

## Trading Mechanics

### Trading Hours
The trading hours for the IFB are generally from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM local time, from Saturday to Wednesday. These hours are aligned with the working week in Iran, which runs from Saturday to Wednesday, with Thursday and Friday being the weekend.

- **Limit Orders**: Orders to buy or sell at a specified price or better.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders**: Orders to buy or sell immediately at the best available current price.

### Settlement
The settlement cycle in the IFB typically follows a T+2 schedule, meaning that the settlement occurs two [business](../b/business.md) days after the [trade](../t/trade.md) date. The Central Securities [Depository](../d/depository.md) of Iran (CSDI) handles the [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) process, ensuring [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and reducing [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).

### Electronic Trading Platforms
The implementation of electronic trading platforms has revolutionized the [market](../m/market.md) structure of IFB, making trading more accessible and efficient. These platforms utilize advanced algorithms for [order](../o/order.md) matching and [execution](../e/execution.md), significantly reducing [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

### Data Analytics

By analyzing vast amounts of [market](../m/market.md) data, the IFB can identify trends, detect anomalies, and make informed decisions to enhance [market](../m/market.md) integrity and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

### Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
The IFB is exploring the use of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and DLT to enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [security](../s/security.md) in securities trading and settlement. [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology can provide a decentralized, immutable ledger, which can significantly reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and improve the post-[trade](../t/trade.md) process.

## International Relations

### Cross-border Listings
The IFB facilitates cross-border listings, enabling foreign companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing securities in the Iranian [market](../m/market.md). This not only provides Iranian investors with [diversification](../d/diversification.md) opportunities but also integrates Iran's financial [market](../m/market.md) with the global [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs)
The IFB has signed several MoUs with international exchanges and regulatory bodies. These agreements foster cooperation, [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of information, and technical assistance, enhancing the IFB's operational framework.

### Sanctions and Global Perceptions
While international economic sanctions have impacted Iran's [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), the IFB continues to operate and attract foreign [interest](../i/interest.md). The lifting of specific sanctions has, at times, led to increased international participation and investment.

## Challenges and Future Prospects

### Regulatory and Economic Environment
The regulatory and economic environment presents both challenges and opportunities for the IFB. Regulatory agility, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and [investor](../i/investor.md) protection are critical factors to boost confidence in the [market](../m/market.md). Moreover, economic stability and growth [will](../w/will.md) propel [market](../m/market.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

### Market Awareness and Education
Increasing [market](../m/market.md) awareness and [financial literacy](../f/financial_literacy.md) among the population is vital for the IFB's growth. Educational initiatives and [investor](../i/investor.md) outreach programs can play a significant role in attracting new investors and enhancing [market](../m/market.md) participation.

### Technological Integration
Continuous technological integration and innovation are key to the IFB's future success. Embracing cutting-edge technologies like [Artificial Intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) (AI), [Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) (ML), and cybersecurity measures [will](../w/will.md) ensure the [market](../m/market.md) remains resilient and competitive.
