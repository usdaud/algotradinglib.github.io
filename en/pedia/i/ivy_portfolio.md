# Ivy Portfolio

The Ivy Portfolio, often referred to as the "[endowment](../e/endowment.md) model," is an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) inspired by the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) models used by the Harvard and Yale university endowments. This strategy aims to achieve strong long-term returns while minimizing [risk](../r/risk.md) through [diversification](../d/diversification.md) across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. Below, we'll delve into the origins, principles, [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), implementation, and key figures associated with the Ivy Portfolio.

## Origins of the Ivy Portfolio

The Ivy Portfolio approach was popularized by Mebane T. Faber and Eric W. Richardson in their 2009 book, "The Ivy Portfolio: How to Invest Like the Top Endowments and Avoid Bear Markets." The strategy draws on the principles employed by leading university endowments, particularly those managed by David Swensen at Yale and Jack Meyer at Harvard. These endowments are known for delivering exceptional long-term performance by diversifying investments across a broad [range](../r/range.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

## Principles of the Ivy Portfolio

The Ivy Portfolio is built on several core principles that are essential for achieving its goals of high returns and low [risk](../r/risk.md):

1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) Across [Multiple](../m/multiple.md) [Asset](../a/asset.md) Classes**:
 - Traditional [asset](../a/asset.md) classes like [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds are complemented by alternative investments, such as [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), commodities, and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds.
 - This broad [diversification](../d/diversification.md) reduces [risk](../r/risk.md) and enhances the potential for returns.

2. **Long-Term [Investment Horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md)**:
 - The strategy emphasizes a long-term outlook, which aligns with the investment horizons of large endowments.
 - This perspective helps investors weather short-term [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and benefit from [compounding](../c/compounding.md) returns over time.

3. **Strategic [Asset Allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md)**:
 - The [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) is carefully designed to balance [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md).
 - The mix of assets is periodically reviewed and adjusted based on changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions and long-term investment goals.

4. **[Active Management](../a/active_management.md) and Tactical Shifts**:
 - While the overall strategy is long-term, tactical adjustments may be made to exploit [market](../m/market.md) opportunities or mitigate risks.
 - This [active management](../a/active_management.md) component can help enhance returns and protect the portfolio during [market](../m/market.md) downturns.

## Asset Allocation in the Ivy Portfolio

The Ivy Portfolio typically includes a diversified mix of traditional and alternative [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. The exact allocation can vary, but a common model might consist of:

1. **Domestic Equities (20%)**:
 - Representing U.S. [stocks](../s/stock.md), this component aims to capture the growth potential of large and small-cap companies.

2. **International Equities (20%)**:
 - Diversifying globally, this allocation includes developed and emerging [market](../m/market.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md), enhancing the portfolio's growth potential and reducing [home](../h/home.md)-country bias.

3. **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) (20%)**:
 - Investments in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), such as REITs, provide [income](../i/income.md) and potential appreciation while serving as a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

4. **Commodities (20%)**:
 - Commodities like gold, oil, and agricultural products [offer](../o/offer.md) [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and can act as a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against economic uncertainties and [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

5. **[Fixed Income](../f/fixed_income.md) (20%)**:
 - Bonds and other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities provide stability and [income](../i/income.md), balancing the portfolio's overall [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Alternative Allocations

Some iterations of the Ivy Portfolio may include other [asset](../a/asset.md) classes or adjust the percentages to reflect individual preferences and [market](../m/market.md) conditions. For example:

- **[Private Equity](../p/private_equity.md)**: Including [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) and [buyout](../b/buyout.md) funds.
- **[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds**: [Offering](../o/offering.md) potential for high returns and [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation through various strategies.
- **Natural Resources**: Investments in timber, farmland, and energy resources.

## Implementing the Ivy Portfolio

Implementing the Ivy Portfolio strategy involves several steps:

1. **Setting Investment Goals**:
 - Clearly define your long-term investment objectives, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md).
 - These factors [will](../w/will.md) guide your [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) decisions.

2. **Choosing Investment Vehicles**:
 - Select appropriate investment vehicles for each [asset class](../a/asset_class.md), such as mutual funds, ETFs, or direct investments.
 - Ensure that the chosen vehicles align with your goals and [offer](../o/offer.md) [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and cost-[efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

3. **Periodic [Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md)**:
 - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) targets.
 - Rebalance periodically to maintain the desired mix of assets and mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md).

4. **Staying Informed**:
 - Keep abreast of [market](../m/market.md) developments, economic trends, and changes in the investment landscape.
 - Monitor the performance of your portfolio and make informed adjustments as needed.

## Benefits and Challenges of the Ivy Portfolio

### Benefits

1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**:
 - Reduces [risk](../r/risk.md) by spreading investments across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) classes with different [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) profiles.

2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation**:
 - The inclusion of alternative investments helps protect the portfolio during [market](../m/market.md) downturns and economic uncertainties.

3. **Potential for High Returns**:
 - The diversified mix of assets offers opportunities for growth and [income](../i/income.md), enhancing overall returns.

### Challenges

1. **Complexity**:
 - Implementing and managing a diversified portfolio can be complex and time-consuming.

2. **Access to Alternative Investments**:
 - Some alternative investments, like [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, may have high entry barriers and limited accessibility for individual investors.

3. **Costs**:
 - Certain [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and investment vehicles may come with higher fees and expenses, impacting net returns.
