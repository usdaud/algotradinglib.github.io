## Algorithmic Trading Strategies

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) encompasses a variety of strategies aimed at optimizing [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) and maximizing profits. Key strategies include:

### 1. **Market Making**:
[Market making algorithms](../m/market_making_algorithms.md) place both buy and sell orders to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md). These algorithms constantly update quotes and manage [inventory](../i/inventory.md) to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and minimize [risk](../r/risk.md).

### 2. **Trend Following**:
[Trend](../t/trend.md)-following algorithms identify and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md) by initiating trades in the direction of the prevailing [trend](../t/trend.md). These strategies often utilize [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as moving averages and [momentum oscillators](../m/momentum_oscillators.md).

### 3. **Statistical Arbitrage**:
Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) exploits price inefficiencies between related financial instruments. These algorithms [leverage](../l/leverage.md) statistical models to identify temporary divergences and execute trades to capture [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md).

### 4. **Mean Reversion**:
[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies assume that [asset](../a/asset.md) prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical averages. Algorithms identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions and place trades to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price corrections.

### 5. **Event-Driven**:
Event-driven algorithms react to [market](../m/market.md)-moving events such as [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md), economic data releases, or geopolitical developments. These algorithms analyze news feeds and [market](../m/market.md) data in real-time to execute trades based on predicted [market](../m/market.md) impact.

## Technology and Infrastructure

The success of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) hinges on advanced technology and [robust](../r/robust.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). Key components include:
