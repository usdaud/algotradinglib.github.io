# In the Money (ITM)

In the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), "In the [Money](../m/money.md)" (ITM) is a term used to describe an option contract that currently possesses [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md). An option is a financial [derivative](../d/derivative.md) that provides the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before or on an [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). ITM [options](../o/options.md) are significant because they indicate that executing the option would currently be profitable for the holder, as opposed to "[At the Money](../a/at_the_money.md)" (ATM) or "Out of the [Money](../m/money.md)" (OTM) [options](../o/options.md).

## Understanding In the Money

### Call Options

A [call option](../c/call_option.md) gives the holder the right to buy an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). A [call option](../c/call_option.md) is considered ITM when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s current [market price](../m/market_price.md) is higher than the option's [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). For instance, if you [hold](../h/hold.md) a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $50, and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock is trading at $60, your option is $10 ITM because you could theoretically buy the stock at the lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and sell it at the current higher [market price](../m/market_price.md).

### Put Options

A [put option](../p/put.md) gives the holder the right to sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). A [put option](../p/put.md) is deemed ITM when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s current [market price](../m/market_price.md) is lower than the option's [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). For example, if you [hold](../h/hold.md) a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $50, and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock is trading at $40, your option is $10 ITM since you could sell the stock at the higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) while it trades lower in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Importance of ITM Options

### Intrinsic Value and Time Value

An option's price is composed of [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) and [time value](../t/time_value.md). ITM [options](../o/options.md) have [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md):
- The [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) for a [call option](../c/call_option.md) is the amount by which the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price exceeds the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- The [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) for a [put option](../p/put.md) is the amount by which the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) exceeds the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price.

The [time value](../t/time_value.md) is the additional [premium](../p/premium.md) representing the possibility that the option could [gain](../g/gain.md) more profitability before expiration. ITM [options](../o/options.md) typically have higher premiums due to their [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).

### Profit Potential

ITM [options](../o/options.md) are crucial for traders because they represent opportunities for [profit](../p/profit.md). Investors interested in understanding their option positions' profitability closely follow whether their [options](../o/options.md) are ITM.

### Reduced Time Decay

[Options](../o/options.md) face [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), meaning their [value](../v/value.md) erodes as the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) nears. ITM [options](../o/options.md) have less [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) effect compared to ATM or OTM [options](../o/options.md), which means they lose [value](../v/value.md) more slowly over time, [offering](../o/offering.md) a more stable investment.

## Strategies Involving ITM Options

### Covered Call Writing

In [covered call writing](../c/covered_call_writing.md), an [investor](../i/investor.md) holds a long position in an [asset](../a/asset.md) and writes call [options](../o/options.md) on that same [asset](../a/asset.md) to generate [income](../i/income.md) through premiums. Writing ITM calls can be more conservative, providing some downside protection and allowing investors to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on premiums while still retaining some potential for [profit](../p/profit.md) if the price rises somewhat above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### Protective Puts

In a [protective put](../p/protective_put.md) strategy, an [investor](../i/investor.md) holds a long position in an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and buys [put options](../p/put_options.md) to guard against downside risks. ITM puts give [robust](../r/robust.md) protection because they [will](../w/will.md) be more valuable as the [asset](../a/asset.md) price falls, making the strategy a form of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) for the investment.

### Bull Call Spread

A [bull call spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md) involves buying a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) (ITM) and selling another [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). This strategy aims to limit the upfront cost by potentially reducing the maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) to cap the returns but still benefits from the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of the ITM call.

## ITM and Risk Management

### Lower Risk than OTM Options

ITM [options](../o/options.md) naturally have [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md), making them less risky than OTM [options](../o/options.md) which could expire worthless if the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is not met by expiration.

### Utilization in Hedging

Traders and [fund](../f/fund.md) managers use ITM [options](../o/options.md) as hedging instruments to mitigate risks within their portfolios. For example, purchasing ITM [put options](../p/put_options.md) on [holdings](../h/holdings.md) can [offset](../o/offset.md) losses in [market](../m/market.md) downturns.

## Real-World Usage and Examples

### Institutional Trading

Institutional investors and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds often [leverage](../l/leverage.md) ITM [options](../o/options.md) for various sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), including hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), and [income](../i/income.md) generation.

### Retail Investors

Retail investors utilize ITM [options](../o/options.md) in their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) by directly engaging with brokerage platforms such as Interactive Brokers to execute trades that align with their financial goals and [risk](../r/risk.md) tolerances.

## Advanced Considerations

### Greek Analytics

To evaluate ITM [options](../o/options.md), traders often use Greek metrics:
- [Delta](../d/delta.md): measures the rate of change in the option's price concerning the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. ITM [options](../o/options.md) have higher delta values.
- [Theta](../t/theta.md): gauges the rate of [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) in the option's price. ITM [options](../o/options.md) have lower theta impacts, meaning their [value](../v/value.md) decays slower over time.
- [Vega](../v/vega.md): indicates the sensitivity of the option's price to [volatility](../v/volatility.md) changes. ITM [options](../o/options.md) can be more resilient to [volatility](../v/volatility.md) fluctuations in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) compared to OTM [options](../o/options.md).

### Implied Volatility

Implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) reflects [market](../m/market.md) expectations of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s [volatility](../v/volatility.md); ITM [options](../o/options.md) possess an inherent [value](../v/value.md) less sensitive to [volatility](../v/volatility.md) spikes compared to OTM [options](../o/options.md).

## Conclusion

In the [Money](../m/money.md) (ITM) [options](../o/options.md) play a vital role in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) for investors and traders, [offering](../o/offering.md) [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) and [profit](../p/profit.md) opportunities. Their stability, reduced [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), and [utility](../u/utility.md) in various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) make them essential components in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and investment planning. Understanding and effectively leveraging ITM [options](../o/options.md) can significantly enhance trading outcomes and [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md).
