# Intermarket Analysis

Intermarket Analysis refers to the analysis of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) classes to predict trends and make investment decisions. It is the study of how different [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) (such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, commodities, and currencies) interact with and influence each other. This approach considers the relationships between these markets to [gain](../g/gain.md) a broader understanding of macroeconomic conditions and potential opportunities.

## The Basics of Intermarket Analysis

Intermarket Analysis primarily examines correlations between [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. These relationships can be categorized into three types:

1. **[Positive Correlation](../p/positive_correlation.md):** When two assets move in the same direction. For example, [stocks](../s/stock.md) and commodities may both rise during periods of [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).
2. **[Negative Correlation](../n/negative_correlation.md):** When two assets move in opposite directions. For example, bonds might rise when [stocks](../s/stock.md) fall, as investors seek safer [options](../o/options.md).
3. **Non-[Correlation](../c/correlation.md):** When there is no noticeable relationship between two assets.

## Historical Context and Development

The concept of Intermarket Analysis gained traction in the 1980s with the pioneering work of [market](../m/market.md) analysts like John Murphy, who published the seminal book, "Intermarket [Technical Analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md): [Trading Strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) for the Global Stock, [Bond](../b/bond.md), [Commodity](../c/commodity.md), and [Currency](../c/currency.md) Markets." Murphy's work emphasized the importance of understanding the interplay between different markets, particularly as technological advancements and [globalization](../g/globalization.md) began integrating economies more closely.

## Key Relationships in Intermarket Analysis

### 1. Stocks and Bonds

The relationship between [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds is one of the most scrutinized aspects of Intermarket Analysis:

- **[Economic Growth](../e/economic_growth.md):** During periods of economic [expansion](../e/expansion.md), stock prices generally rise due to higher corporate [earnings](../e/earnings.md). Conversely, [bond](../b/bond.md) prices might fall because investors [demand](../d/demand.md) higher yields to compensate for potential [inflation](../i/inflation.md).
- **Economic Contraction:** In times of economic slowdown or [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), investors often flock to bonds, considering them a safer alternative to [stocks](../s/stock.md). This leads to rising [bond](../b/bond.md) prices and falling stock prices.

### 2. Stocks and Commodities

[Stocks](../s/stock.md) and commodities often exhibit a [positive correlation](../p/positive_correlation.md) during [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) phases:

- **Fiscal and [Monetary Policy](../m/monetary_policy.md):** When central banks implement expansionary policies, [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices typically rise due to increased [demand](../d/demand.md) and potential inflationary pressures. Companies, benefiting from higher [demand](../d/demand.md) and revenues, see their stock prices appreciate.
- **Technological and Sectoral Shifts:** Shifts in technology and sectoral dominance can alter the relationship between [stocks](../s/stock.md) and commodities. For instance, a boom in renewable energy can increase [demand](../d/demand.md) for certain commodities like lithium, used in batteries, potentially benefiting specific stock sectors.

### 3. Commodities and Currencies

Commodities and currencies often exhibit strong relationships, particularly between specific [commodity](../c/commodity.md) exports and their respective national currencies:

- **Petro-Currencies:** Countries heavily reliant on oil exports, such as Canada and Russia, have currencies that tend to move in tandem with oil prices.
- **Safe-Haven Currencies:** During periods of economic [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), currencies like the Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen often appreciate as investors seek safer assets. This can impact commodities inversely due to shifts in investment preferences.

### 4. Currencies and Bonds

The relationship between currencies and bonds is driven by [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) differentials:

- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Policies:** Higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates generally attract [foreign investment](../f/foreign_investment.md), leading to stronger currencies. Lower rates, conversely, might weaken a [currency](../c/currency.md). This relationship is crucial when analyzing [bond](../b/bond.md) yields across different countries.
- **Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) Interventions:** Actions by central banks, such as [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) or tightening monetary policies, directly affect [bond](../b/bond.md) prices and, consequently, [currency](../c/currency.md) values.

## Applying Intermarket Analysis in Trading

Intermarket Analysis can be employed using several strategies:

### 1. Trend Identification

By identifying trends across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, traders can anticipate [market](../m/market.md) movements. For instance, if [bond](../b/bond.md) prices start to fall while stock prices rise, it might signal a burgeoning economic [expansion](../e/expansion.md), prompting traders to allocate more towards equities.

### 2. Divergence Analysis

[Divergence](../d/divergence.md) analysis involves identifying discrepancies between [asset](../a/asset.md) classes that typically move together. For example, if [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices and stock prices usually rise together, but commodities start to fall while [stocks](../s/stock.md) continue rising, it might signal an impending [correction](../c/correction.md) in stock markets.

### 3. Risk Management and Diversification

Understanding intermarket relationships helps in constructing diversified portfolios that mitigate risks. By balancing investments across [asset](../a/asset.md) classes that do not move in tandem, investors can protect their portfolios from significant downturns.

## Case Studies in Intermarket Analysis

### Case Study 1: The 2008 Financial Crisis

During the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), Intermarket Analysis proved crucial in understanding [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md):

- **[Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md) Collapse:** As the crisis unfolded, stock markets plummeted globally due to fears of economic [recession](../r/recession.md) and financial instability.
- **[Bond Market](../b/bond_market.md) Surge:** Investors flocked to the relative safety of bonds, particularly U.S. Treasuries, driving their prices up.
- **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Crash:** Commodities, including oil and metals, saw significant price drops due to anticipated economic slowdown and reduced [demand](../d/demand.md).
- **[Currency](../c/currency.md) Fluctuations:** Safe-haven currencies like the U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen appreciated as investors sought stability.

### Case Study 2: The COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 offered another instance where Intermarket Analysis provided valuable insights:

- **[Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** Initial shocks saw massive sell-offs in stock markets globally. However, unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus led to a swift recovery in many markets.
- **[Bond Market](../b/bond_market.md) Reactions:** Central banks slashed [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and engaged in extensive [bond](../b/bond.md)-buying programs, impacting [bond](../b/bond.md) yields and prices.
- **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Price Swings:** [Crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) prices plunged initially due to reduced [demand](../d/demand.md), even entering negative territory briefly. Gold, a traditional safe-haven [asset](../a/asset.md), saw prices rise.
- **[Currency](../c/currency.md) Movements:** The U.S. Dollar initially strengthened due to its safe-haven status but later weakened due to massive fiscal deficits and lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
