# Index Options

### Introduction
[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) [options](../o/options.md) are financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a basket of [stocks](../s/stock.md) represented by a specific [index](../i/index_instrument.md) at a predetermined price before or on a specified [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). Unlike stock [options](../o/options.md) which are based on individual assets, [index](../i/index_instrument.md) [options](../o/options.md) are based on an entire [index](../i/index_instrument.md) such as the S&P 500, [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100, or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These instruments are widely used for hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), and [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md).

### Types of Index Options
There are two primary types of [index](../i/index_instrument.md) [options](../o/options.md):

1. **Call [Options](../o/options.md):** These give the holder the right to buy the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

5. **[Risk](../r/risk.md)-Free [Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md):** The current [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), typically the [yield](../y/yield.md) on government bonds.

### Settlement of Index Options
[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) [options](../o/options.md) are typically cash-settled, which means that upon expiration, the difference between the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) price and the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is paid in cash. The settlement can be:

2. **American-style:** Exercisable at any point before expiration.
