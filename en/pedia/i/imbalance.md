# Imbalance

Imbalance in trading refers to a mismatch between buy and sell interest. It can describe differences in order size, order count, or aggressive trading on one side of the market.

## Types of imbalance
- Order book imbalance: more resting buy orders than sell orders or the opposite.
- Trade imbalance: more executed volume on the buy side or sell side.
- Auction imbalance: net buy or sell volume in an opening or closing auction.

## Why it matters
Imbalances can move price when one side dominates. A strong buy imbalance can push price higher, while a sell imbalance can pressure price lower. Many trading venues publish auction imbalance data near open or close.

## Example
A closing auction shows a large buy imbalance for a stock. Traders expect upward pressure into the close and adjust positions accordingly.

## Practical notes
Imbalance signals can be noisy. They work best when combined with liquidity context, volatility, and broader market direction.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Imbalance and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Imbalance as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Imbalance, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Imbalance. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Imbalance alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
