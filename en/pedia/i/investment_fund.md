# Investment Fund

An investment [fund](../f/fund.md) is a sum of [money](../m/money.md) pooled together by a large group of investors to collectively purchase securities while each [investor](../i/investor.md) retains ownership and control of their own [shares](../s/shares.md). Investment funds provide a way for individuals to invest indirectly in a diversified portfolio of assets, which may include [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), commodities, and more. The concept behind investment funds is to reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) through [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and take advantage of professional [money management](../m/money_management.md).

## Types of Investment Funds

### 1. **Mutual Funds**
Mutual funds are one of the most common types of investment funds. They are managed by professional [money](../m/money.md) managers who allocate the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s assets and attempt to produce [capital](../c/capital.md) gains or [income](../i/income.md) for the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s investors. Mutual funds [offer](../o/offer.md) various types to match different investment objectives:
- **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Funds** – Invest in [stocks](../s/stock.md).
- **Fixed-[Income](../i/income.md) Funds** – Invest in bonds.
- **[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Funds** – Aim to replicate the performance of a specific [index](../i/index_instrument.md) like the S&P 500.
- **Balanced Funds** – Combine [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds.
- **[Money Market](../m/money_market.md) Funds** – Invest in short-term, low-[risk](../r/risk.md) securities.

### 2. **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**
ETFs are similar to mutual funds but [trade](../t/trade.md) on stock exchanges like individual [stocks](../s/stock.md). They [offer](../o/offer.md) the [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md) of mutual funds with the flexibility of stock trading. Examples include:
- **SPDR S&P 500 ETF [Trust](../t/trust.md) (SPY)** which tracks the S&P 500 [index](../i/index_instrument.md).
- **Vanguard Total [Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md) ETF (VTI)** which offers broad exposure to the total U.S. [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

### 3. **Hedge Funds**
[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds are private investment funds that employ various strategies to earn active returns for their investors. They may use [leverage](../l/leverage.md), [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and [short selling](../s/short_selling.md). [Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds are less regulated compared to mutual funds and are usually [open](../o/open.md) only to accredited investors. Examples include:
- **Bridgewater Associates**
- **Renaissance Technologies**

### 4. **Closed-End Funds**
Closed-end funds [issue](../i/issue.md) a fixed number of [shares](../s/shares.md) through an initial public [offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO) and then these [shares](../s/shares.md) are traded on exchanges. They don’t constantly [issue](../i/issue.md) new [shares](../s/shares.md) or redeem existing ones like mutual funds.

### 5. **Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)**
UITs [issue](../i/issue.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) in a fixed portfolio of securities and have a predetermined termination date. They usually [hold](../h/hold.md) assets until the [trust](../t/trust.md) is dissolved.

### 6. **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**
REITs are companies that own, operate, or [finance](../f/finance.md) [income](../i/income.md)-generating [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). They provide a way for individual investors to earn a share of the [income](../i/income.md) produced through [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) ownership.

## Key Terminology

### **Net Asset Value (NAV)**
NAV is the total [value](../v/value.md) of a [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets minus its liabilities, typically expressed on a per-share [basis](../b/basis.md). It's similar to the notion of "[book value](../b/book_value.md)" in individual [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### **Expense Ratio**
The [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md) represents the annual fees charged to investors, calculated as a percentage of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s average assets under management. Lower [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios are preferred as they mean higher net returns for investors.

### **Diversification**
[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) is an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) that [spreads](../s/spreads.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) by allocating investments among various financial instruments, industries, and other categories. It aims to minimize the impact of any single [asset](../a/asset.md)'s poor performance on the overall portfolio.

### **Yield**
In the context of investment funds, [yield](../y/yield.md) refers to the [income](../i/income.md) [return](../r/return.md) (such as dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md)) from an investment, usually expressed annually as a percentage based on the investment's cost, current [market value](../m/market_value.md), or [face value](../f/face_value.md).

### **Turnover Rate**
This measures how frequently assets within a [fund](../f/fund.md) are bought and sold by the managers. High [turnover](../t/turnover.md) rates can imply higher costs due to [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) and [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Investment Fund Managers

[Fund](../f/fund.md) managers, or [asset](../a/asset.md) managers, are responsible for making investment decisions on behalf of the [fund](../f/fund.md). Their skills, strategies, and decisions significantly impact the performance of the investment [fund](../f/fund.md). Several prominent [fund](../f/fund.md) management firms include:
- **BlackRock** - **Vanguard** - **[Fidelity Investments](../f/fidelity_investments.md)** - **T. Rowe Price**
## Advantages of Investment Funds

### **1. Diversification**
One of the biggest benefits of [investing](../i/investing.md) in funds is [diversification](../d/diversification.md). By pooling resources, an investment [fund](../f/fund.md) can invest in a wide [range](../r/range.md) of assets, which helps to spread [risk](../r/risk.md).

### **2. Professional Management**
Investment funds are managed by experienced professionals who can make informed decisions. This helps investors who may not have the expertise or time to manage their own portfolios.

### **3. Economies of Scale**
Large investment funds can negotiate lower [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) and other costs, which can translate into lower expenses for individual investors.

### **4. Accessibility and Liquidity**
Many investment funds [offer](../o/offer.md) features like low minimum investment requirements and high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), meaning investors can easily buy or sell their [fund](../f/fund.md) [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Disadvantages of Investment Funds

### **1. Fees and Expenses**
Investment funds can come with various fees, including management fees, administrative fees, and performance fees, which can reduce the net returns to investors.

### **2. Lack of Control**
When you invest in a [fund](../f/fund.md), you surrender the ability to directly influence the choice of securities. The [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) makes all the investment decisions.

### **3. Tax Consequences**
Frequent trading within a [fund](../f/fund.md) can create taxable events for investors, leading to a [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) that might not be present in other types of investments.

### **4. Over Diversification**
While [diversification](../d/diversification.md) is generally positive, too much [diversification](../d/diversification.md) can dilute potential returns as the investment gets spread too thin.

## How to Evaluate Investment Funds

### **Performance History**
Look at the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s historical performance over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) time frames (1-year, 3-year, 5-year, etc.) to understand its consistency and long-term returns.

### **Expense Ratio**
Funds with lower [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios often provide higher net returns as they consume a smaller portion of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

### **Risk Measurements**
Analyze the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s [risk](../r/risk.md), typically represented by [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md), beta, and the [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md). Consider how much [risk](../r/risk.md) you’re willing to take on.

### **Turnover Rate**
[Check](../c/check.md) the [turnover](../t/turnover.md) rate to gauge the frequency of trading within the [fund](../f/fund.md). High [turnover](../t/turnover.md) might indicate more [active management](../a/active_management.md) and higher [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

### **Manager’s Tenure**
A [fund](../f/fund.md) managed by the same manager for an extended period can [offer](../o/offer.md) insights into the management's stability and effectiveness.

### **Fund Size**
Consider the size of the [fund](../f/fund.md). Extremely large funds may face difficulties in delivering high returns due to inefficiencies in large-scale trading.

## Conclusion

Investment funds [offer](../o/offer.md) a variety of opportunities for both novice and seasoned investors. Through diversified portfolios and professional management, they represent a relatively low-barrier entry into the world of [investing](../i/investing.md) while spreading [risk](../r/risk.md) and reducing individual [asset](../a/asset.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). However, it's crucial to consider the associated fees, the degree of control surrendered, and the potential tax implications. Each type of [fund](../f/fund.md) brings its own set of benefits and drawbacks, making it essential for investors to conduct thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) before committing their resources. Consult the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [prospectus](../p/prospectus.md) and resources available on the [fund](../f/fund.md) management company's online platform for detailed information and performance data.
