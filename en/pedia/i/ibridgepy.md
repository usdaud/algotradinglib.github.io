# IBridgePy

## Overview
IBridgePy is a flexible and powerful Python [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) that allows traders to automate their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) with [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) (IB). It provides a simplified interface to connect Python-based algorithms to IB’s [robust](../r/robust.md) trading [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), making it accessible for both individual traders and institutional clients.

## Features
1. **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) Integration**: Seamless integration with [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md), providing access to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial instruments including [stocks](../s/stock.md), [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), forex, and bonds.
2. **Python-Based**: Allows users to develop [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) using Python, leveraging its extensive libraries for data analysis and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md).
3. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Comprehensive [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) capabilities to test [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) against historical data.
4. **Live Trading**: Support for live trading, enabling the [execution](../e/execution.md) of strategies in real-time markets.
5. **Paper Trading**: Paper trading [mode](../m/mode.md) for testing strategies in a simulated environment without risking real [money](../m/money.md).
6. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event-driven programming model for responsive and efficient [trading algorithm development](../t/trading_algorithm_development.md).
7. **Data Handling**: Tools for managing and processing real-time and historical [market](../m/market.md) data.
8. **Customizable**: Highly customizable to fit specific trading needs and strategies.

## Key Components
- **IBridgePy Core**: The main framework that connects Python [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) to [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md).
- **Strategy Development**: Tools and interfaces for developing and implementing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) in Python.
- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) Engine**: Allows for thorough [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) of strategies using historical [market](../m/market.md) data.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Data**: Real-time and historical [market](../m/market.md) [data integration](../d/data_integration.md) from [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md).
- **[Order Management](../o/order_management_in_trading.md)**: Comprehensive [order management](../o/order_management_in_trading.md) system for placing, modifying, and tracking orders.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Tools for managing and mitigating trading risks.

## Integrations
IBridgePy is designed to work seamlessly with [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md), providing a [range](../r/range.md) of integration [options](../o/options.md) to enhance trading capabilities:

- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) API**: Direct integration with IB’s API for real-time data and [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md).
- **Python Libraries**: Compatible with popular Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data analysis and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md).
- **Third-Party Data Providers**: Ability to integrate with other data providers for additional [market](../m/market.md) data.

## Community and Support
IBridgePy offers extensive support through detailed documentation, tutorials, and a dedicated support team. Users can also access community forums and online resources to share knowledge, ask questions, and get assistance from other IBridgePy users.

## Use Cases
- **Retail Traders**: Allows individual traders to automate their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and access a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial instruments.
- **Quantitative Analysts**: Supports quantitative analysts in developing and testing complex [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).
- **Institutional Clients**: Provides a [robust](../r/robust.md) platform for institutional clients to implement large-scale [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md).
- **Educational Purposes**: Useful for educational purposes in teaching [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and Python programming.

IBridgePy’s powerful and flexible platform makes it a preferred choice for traders looking to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) Python for automating their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) with [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md).

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for IBridgePy and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.
