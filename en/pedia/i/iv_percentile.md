# IV Percentile

IV percentile measures how current implied volatility compares to its own historical distribution. It is the percentage of past observations that are below the current implied volatility.

## Formula
IV Percentile = (Number of days with IV below current / Total days in lookback) * 100

## Interpretation
- A high percentile means current IV is high relative to its history.
- A low percentile means current IV is low relative to its history.

## Example
Over a 252 day lookback, current IV is higher than 200 days and lower than 52 days. The IV percentile is 200 / 252 * 100, about 79 percent.

## Practical use
Options traders use IV percentile to decide when option premiums are relatively expensive or cheap compared to the past.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for IV Percentile and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating IV Percentile as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For IV Percentile, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying IV Percentile. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use IV Percentile alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
