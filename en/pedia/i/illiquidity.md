# Illiquidity

Illiquidity refers to the difficulty of buying or selling an asset without moving its price. It increases trading costs and can make risk management more difficult.

## Common Measures
Typical measures include bid ask spread, depth at top of book, trading volume, and turnover. Price impact metrics such as the Amihud ratio capture how much price moves per unit of volume. These measures highlight both day to day liquidity and stress conditions.

## Trading Impact
Illiquid markets lead to higher slippage and partial fills. Large orders can move prices significantly, creating adverse execution. Liquidity can also vanish during market stress, amplifying losses.

## Managing Illiquidity
Traders can manage illiquidity by reducing order size, using longer execution windows, and avoiding thin trading periods. Portfolio construction should account for liquidity when sizing positions and setting risk limits.

## Conclusion
Illiquidity is a primary source of trading cost and risk. Strategies that ignore it often fail when scaled.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Illiquidity and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Illiquidity as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Illiquidity, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Illiquidity. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Illiquidity alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
