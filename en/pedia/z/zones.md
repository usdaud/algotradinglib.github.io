# Zones

Zones in trading refer to price areas where buyers or sellers are expected to be active. Zones are broader than single price levels and are used to plan entries, exits, and risk placement.

## Common zone types
- Support zones where buying pressure appears.
- Resistance zones where selling pressure appears.
- Supply and demand zones based on strong reversals.

## Example
A stock repeatedly bounces between 45 and 46. A trader marks this range as a support zone and looks for long entries on pullbacks.

## Practical notes
Zones are subjective and depend on the timeframe and methodology. Using multiple confirmations reduces false signals.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Zones and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Zones as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Zones, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Zones. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Zones alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
