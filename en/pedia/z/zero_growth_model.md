# Zero Growth Model

## Introduction
The Zero Growth Model is a straight-forward [valuation](../v/valuation.md) method used in [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly in [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [discount](../d/discount.md) models (DDMs) for valuing a company's stock. It assumes that dividends remain at a constant level indefinitely, meaning the company experiences zero growth over time. This model is best suited for companies with stable [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and minimal growth prospects, such as utilities or mature firms.

## Basic Formula
The Zero Growth Model simplifies the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) process through a formula derived from the [perpetuity](../p/perpetuity.md) concept. The formula is as follows:

\[ P_0 = \frac{D}{r} \]

Where:
- \( P_0 \) = Price of the stock today
- \( D \) = Expected [dividend](../d/dividend.md) per share next year
- \( r \) = Required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) ([discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md))

This formula essentially calculates the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of a [perpetuity](../p/perpetuity.md), where the [perpetuity](../p/perpetuity.md) is the stream of dividends that [will](../w/will.md) continue to be paid indefinitely without any growth.

## Assumptions
The Zero Growth Model relies on a set of key assumptions:
1. **Constant Dividends**: The [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments remain constant and don't grow over time.
2. **Infinite [Time Horizon](../t/time_horizon.md)**: The company is expected to continue operating indefinitely, paying the same [dividend](../d/dividend.md).
3. **Constant Required [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md)**: The [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) required by investors does not change.
4. **Stable Economic Environment**: There are no economic shocks that could affect the company's ability to pay dividends.

## Application in Valuation
To [value](../v/value.md) a stock using the Zero Growth Model, you need to determine the expected [dividend](../d/dividend.md) and the required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md):
1. **Expected [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) (D)**: This is usually derived from the company's historical [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments.
2. **Required [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (r)**: This can be estimated using the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM), which considers the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate, the stock’s [beta](../b/beta.md), and the [equity market](../e/equity_market.md) [premium](../p/premium.md).

## Example
Suppose XYZ [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) pays an annual [dividend](../d/dividend.md) of $5 per share, and you require a 10% [return](../r/return.md) on your investment. Applying the Zero Growth Model:

\[ P_0 = \frac{5}{0.10} = $50 \]

Thus, the [value](../v/value.md) of XYZ [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s stock, assuming zero growth in dividends, is $50 per share.

## Limitations
While the Zero Growth Model offers simplicity, it carries several limitations:
1. **Inapplicability to [Growth Stocks](../g/growth_stocks.md)**: The model is unsuitable for companies expected to grow their dividends.
2. **[Interest Rate Sensitivity](../i/interest_rate_sensitivity.md)**: The model is highly sensitive to changes in the required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md).
3. **Assumption of [Perpetuity](../p/perpetuity.md)**: The assumption that a company [will](../w/will.md) exist indefinitely may not [hold](../h/hold.md) true in a volatile [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Comparison with Other Models
The Zero Growth Model is often compared with the Constant Growth Model ([Gordon Growth Model](../g/gordon_growth_model.md)) and the Two-Stage [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Discount](../d/discount.md) Model:
1. **Constant Growth Model**: Assumes dividends grow at a constant rate. Suitable for mature companies with predictable growth.
2. **Two-Stage Model**: Accounts for an initial period of high growth followed by stable growth. Useful for young, high-growth companies transitioning to stability.

## Real-World Example
Consider a [utility](../u/utility.md) company like Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison). Such companies often exhibit stable [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and dividends:


Suppose Con Edison pays an annual [dividend](../d/dividend.md) of $3 per share, and investors require a 5% [return](../r/return.md). Using the Zero Growth Model, the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) would be:

\[ P_0 = \frac{3}{0.05} = $60 \]

Therefore, Con Edison’s stock would be valued at $60 per share based on the assumption of zero growth in dividends.

## Conclusion
The Zero Growth Model serves as a fundamental tool for valuing [stocks](../s/stock.md) with minimal growth prospects. While its simplicity can be an advantage, investors must be wary of its assumptions and limitations, making it essential to apply this model only to appropriate scenarios. For [stocks](../s/stock.md) with expected growth, other [valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md) should be considered to capture the growth potential accurately.
