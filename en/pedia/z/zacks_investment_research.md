# Zacks Investment Research

Zacks Investment Research is an American company that specializes in providing financial information, research, and analysis to the investment community. Founded in 1978 by Leonard Zacks, the [firm](../f/firm.md) is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Zacks Investment Research is well-known for its proprietary [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) that investors use to evaluate the performance of [stocks](../s/stock.md), mutual funds, [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs), and other financial instruments. This in-depth analysis [will](../w/will.md) cover various aspects of Zacks Investment Research, including its history, proprietary ranking systems, research methodologies, and services.

## History

Zacks Investment Research was founded by Leonard Zacks, who completed his Ph.D. in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Leonard Zacks developed a ground-breaking model to interpret and predict the impact of [earnings surprises](../e/earnings_surprises.md) on stock prices. This model helped fuel the strategic direction of his new company, which began operations with a focus on providing high-quality [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and investment research.

Initially, the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s aim was to provide institutional investors with insights drawn from a database of corporate [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and [profit](../p/profit.md) reports. Over the years, Zacks has diversified its offerings to include services for individual investors, financial advisors, and retail investors. As the company grew, it embraced new technologies and methodologies to stay relevant in the ever-changing financial landscape.

## Proprietary Ranking Systems

One of the most significant contributions Zacks Investment Research has made to the financial [industry](../i/industry.md) is its proprietary ranking systems. These ranking models evaluate [stocks](../s/stock.md), mutual funds, and ETFs based on various factors:

### Zacks Rank

The most famous of these models is the Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a unique, quantitative model that rates [stocks](../s/stock.md) based on four primary factors: Agreement, Magnitude, [Upside](../u/upside.md), and Surprise. Each [factor](../f/factor.md) contributes to a stock's overall Zacks Rank, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). 

- **Agreement**: Measures the degree of consensus among analysts' [earnings estimates](../e/earnings_estimate.md).
- **Magnitude**: Assesses the size of recent [earnings](../e/earnings.md) estimate changes.
- **[Upside](../u/upside.md)**: Evaluates the potential [upside](../u/upside.md) based on [earnings](../e/earnings.md) estimate revisions.
- **Surprise**: Tracks the frequency and magnitude of [earnings surprises](../e/earnings_surprises.md) by companies.

[Stocks](../s/stock.md) rated #1 (Strong Buy) historically have outperformed the [market](../m/market.md), making the Zacks Rank a valuable tool for investors looking to make informed investment decisions.

### Zacks Industry Rank

In addition to individual stock ratings, Zacks Investment Research also employs the Zacks [Industry](../i/industry.md) Rank. By comparing and ranking industries based on the average Zacks Rank of the constituent companies, this model helps investors identify sectors likely to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) or [underperform](../u/underperform.md) relative to the broader [market](../m/market.md).

### Zacks Equity Research Reports

Zacks provides comprehensive research reports that include the Zacks Rank along with detailed analyses of [earnings](../e/earnings.md), [valuation](../v/valuation.md), stock [statistics](../s/statistics.md), and competitive positioning. These reports are widely used by institutional investors to make informed decisions.

## Research Methodologies

The core of Zacks’ research methodologies lies in its data-driven, quantitative approach to [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md). The [firm](../f/firm.md) leverages advanced statistical techniques, [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), and [big data analytics](../b/big_data_analytics_in_trading.md) to interpret and predict stock performance. Below are some of the core methodologies employed by Zacks Investment Research:

### Earnings Estimate Revisions 

One of the central premises of Zacks' research methodology is that [earnings](../e/earnings.md) estimate revisions are a powerful [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of stock performance. Analysts’ [earnings estimates](../e/earnings_estimate.md) are continually updated based on new information, and Zacks models track these revisions to predict future stock behavior.

### Earnings Surprises

Zacks places significant emphasis on [earnings surprises](../e/earnings_surprises.md)—instances where a company reports [earnings](../e/earnings.md) above or below analysts' expectations. According to Zacks' research, [earnings surprises](../e/earnings_surprises.md) have a strong impact on stock prices, often leading to significant price movements. Thus, the [firm](../f/firm.md) incorporates [earnings](../e/earnings.md) surprise data into its ranking models.

### Fundamental Analysis

While the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model, the company also conducts traditional [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md). This includes evaluating a company's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), management effectiveness, competitive advantages, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and much more. This comprehensive approach ensures that the [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) are backed by [robust](../r/robust.md) qualitative insights.
