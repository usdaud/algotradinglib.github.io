# Zaif

Zaif is a cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) platform based in Japan, which originally launched in 2015. It offers a [range](../r/range.md) of services including cryptocurrency trading, [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md), and token issuance. The platform is well-known for its unique features and regulatory compliance, making it a significant player in the Japanese cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md).

## Overview

Zaif was founded by Tech Bureau, a technology [firm](../f/firm.md) specializing in [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) solutions. Over the years, Zaif has garnered considerable attention due to its user-friendly interface, [robust](../r/robust.md) performance, and a variety of supported cryptocurrencies. The platform allows traders to buy, sell, and [trade](../t/trade.md) various digital assets including [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) (BTC), [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH), and many other altcoins.

## Services Offered

### Cryptocurrency Trading

Zaif provides a comprehensive [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) where users can [trade](../t/trade.md) numerous cryptocurrencies against both fiat currencies (such as JPY) and other digital assets. The platform supports various trading pairs, which makes it versatile for different [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). The user interface is designed to cater to both beginners and advanced traders, [offering](../o/offering.md) tools like charts, [order](../o/order.md) books, and advanced [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md).

### Margin Trading

In addition to standard trading, Zaif also offers [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) [options](../o/options.md). This service allows traders to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) their positions to potentially increase their returns. However, [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) also comes with heightened [risk](../r/risk.md), requiring traders to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) caution and employ [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies.

### Token Issuance

Zaif provides a token issuance platform, where businesses can create and [issue](../i/issue.md) their own tokens using Zaif's [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology. This service is particularly useful for startups and companies looking to raise funds through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or [Security](../s/security.md) Token Offerings (STOs).

## Regulatory Compliance

Zaif operates under strict regulatory guidelines set forth by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA). The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) is registered and compliant with local laws, ensuring a legal and secure [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md) for its users. Following a significant [security](../s/security.md) breach in 2018, Zaif has reinforced its [security](../s/security.md) measures and has continued to build [trust](../t/trust.md) among its users.

## Security Features

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Zaif employs Two-[Factor](../f/factor.md) Authentication (2FA) to provide an additional layer of [security](../s/security.md). This requires users to verify their identity through a secondary device, usually a mobile phone, making unauthorized access more difficult.

### Cold Storage

A significant portion of users' funds is stored in cold wallets, which are offline and thereby secure from online hacking attempts. This reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of losing funds through cyber-attacks.

### Anti-Phishing Measures

To combat phishing attacks, Zaif has implemented anti-phishing measures which include sending alerts and warnings to users about suspicious activities or attempts to steal credentials.

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

Zaif supports a wide [range](../r/range.md) of cryptocurrencies, making it a versatile platform for traders. Some of the major supported currencies include:

- [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) (BTC)
- [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH)
- [Bitcoin Cash](../b/bitcoin_cash.md) (BCH)
- NEM (XEM)
- MonaCoin (MONA)
- [Counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) (XCP)

## Trading Features

### Spot Trading

Zaif offers spot trading, where traders can instantly buy or sell cryptocurrencies at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). This is the most straightforward form of trading and is suitable for both new and experienced traders.

### Automated Trading

For those interested in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), Zaif supports the use of trading bots. These bots can execute trades based on pre-set rules and conditions, allowing for automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that can operate without constant manual intervention.

### API Integrations

Zaif offers API integrations that allow developers to build custom applications and trading tools. The APIs provide access to [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md), [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), and other trading functionalities, making it easier for technical users to optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Fee Structure

The [fee](../f/fee.md) structure at Zaif is competitive, catering to both high-[volume](../v/volume.md) traders and smaller participants. Below are some key components of their [fee](../f/fee.md) schedule:

- **Trading Fees:** Generally [range](../r/range.md) between 0.1% to 0.5% depending on the trading [volume](../v/volume.md) and type of [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
- **[Deposit](../d/deposit.md) Fees:** Zaif does not charge fees for deposits made in cryptocurrencies, but fiat deposits may incur a minimal [fee](../f/fee.md).
- **[Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) Fees:** Similar to [deposit](../d/deposit.md) fees, [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) fees are mostly applicable for fiat currencies and vary depending on the [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) method.

## Customer Support

Zaif provides [multiple](../m/multiple.md) support channels including email, live chat, and a comprehensive FAQ section. The [customer service](../c/customer_service.md) team is known for its responsiveness and usually addresses issues or queries in a timely manner.

## Recent Developments

In September 2018, Zaif experienced a significant [security](../s/security.md) breach which resulted in the loss of cryptocurrencies worth around 6.7 billion yen. Following this event, Zaif was acquired by Fisco Digital [Asset](../a/asset.md) Group, another Japan-based company specializing in financial services. Since the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), Zaif has bolstered its [security](../s/security.md) measures and continues to operate under enhanced regulatory scrutiny.

## Registration and Verification Process

### Account Creation

Signing up on Zaif involves creating an account by providing an email address and setting a password. This is followed by an email verification step.

### KYC Process

To comply with regulatory requirements, Zaif mandates a Know Your [Customer](../c/customer.md) (KYC) process where users need to submit identification documents such as a passport or driver's license. This step is crucial for ensuring the legitimacy of users and preventing unlawful activities such as [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md).

## API Documentation

Zaif provides detailed API documentation, enabling developers to integrate their own applications with the platform. The API supports various functionalities including [order](../o/order.md) placement, [market](../m/market.md) data retrieval, and account management. The documentation can be accessed here: Zaif API Documentation.

Zaif stands out in the crowded cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md) due to its regulatory compliance, [robust](../r/robust.md) [security](../s/security.md) features, and a wide [range](../r/range.md) of supported services.
