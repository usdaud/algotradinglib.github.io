# Zero Investment Strategy

A Zero [Investment Strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) (ZIS) refers to an investment approach where an [investor](../i/investor.md) constructs a portfolio that has a [net investment](../n/net_investment.md) of zero. This means that the amount invested in the long positions equals the amount generated from the short positions. The primary objective of a zero [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) is to exploit [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities, [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies, or to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [risk](../r/risk.md) without [tying](../t/tying.md) up [capital](../c/capital.md). This strategy is commonly used in the realm of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), particularly in the field of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) where sophisticated techniques and computational power are employed to realize such opportunities. 

### Fundamentals of Zero Investment Strategy

A Zero [Investment Strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) primarily relies on the ability to identify price disparities between related financial instruments and exploit these differences to generate profits. The basic idea is to take a long position in [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) securities while simultaneously taking a short position in [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) securities, ensuring that the total [capital](../c/capital.md) invested equals zero.

#### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets to generate a [profit](../p/profit.md). For example, if a [security](../s/security.md) is trading at different prices on different exchanges, a [trader](../t/trader.md) can buy the [security](../s/security.md) on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) where the price is lower and sell it on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) where the price is higher, thereby making a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md). In a zero [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) plays a significant role as it allows traders to capture discrepancies without deploying [capital](../c/capital.md).

#### Hedging

Hedging is a [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategy used to [offset](../o/offset.md) potential losses in one [security](../s/security.md) by taking an opposite position in a related [security](../s/security.md). In a zero [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), hedging helps in neutralizing [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md). For example, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) is long on a stock, they might short a related [index](../i/index_instrument.md) or another stock in the same [industry](../i/industry.md) to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md). This effectively results in a net zero investment while reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of adverse [market](../m/market.md) movements.

#### Market Neutral Strategy

A [market neutral](../m/market_neutral.md) strategy aims to generate returns that are independent of [market](../m/market.md) movements by being both long and short in the [market](../m/market.md). In a zero [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), a [market neutral](../m/market_neutral.md) approach is often employed to insure that the portfolioâ€™s overall exposure to [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) is minimized. This is achieved by balancing long positions in [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) securities against short positions in [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) securities.

### Applications in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo trading, involves the use of computer algorithms to automate trading decisions and execute trades at high speed. A zero [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) is well-suited to [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) due to its reliance on speed, precision, and the ability to process large amounts of data for identifying [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities and executing trades efficiently.

#### Statistical Arbitrage

Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), commonly known as StatArb, involves using quantitative techniques and statistical models to identify and exploit relative price movements of financial instruments. This involves analyzing historical price data to determine patterns and correlations between different securities. In a zero [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), StatArb algorithms can identify pairs of securities that have a long-term historical relationship but have recently diverged in price. The algorithm then takes a long position in the underperforming [security](../s/security.md) and a short position in the outperforming [security](../s/security.md), expecting prices to converge over time.

#### Pairs Trading

[Pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md) is a specific form of statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) where an [investor](../i/investor.md) simultaneously takes a long position in one [security](../s/security.md) and a short position in a related [security](../s/security.md). The two securities traded usually have a high degree of [correlation](../c/correlation.md). The strategy aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the relative price movements rather than the absolute price movements. For instance, if [security](../s/security.md) A and [security](../s/security.md) B are historically correlated, but recently A's price has increased while B's price has decreased, an algorithm might take a short position in A and a long position in B, expecting the prices to revert to their historical relationship.

#### Market Making

[Market](../m/market.md) making refers to providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the markets by quoting both buy and sell prices for securities and profiting from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md). In a zero [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), algorithmic [market](../m/market.md) makers use sophisticated algorithms to adjust their quotes dynamically based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions, ensuring net zero investment while capitalizing on short-term price discrepancies and trading volumes. [High-frequency trading algorithms](../h/high-frequency_trading_algorithms.md) are often used for [market](../m/market.md) making due to their ability to operate at microsecond speeds.

### Key Components of Zero Investment Strategy

To successfully implement a zero [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), several critical components must be in place, including [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), advanced technology, and access to comprehensive [market](../m/market.md) data.

#### Risk Management

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is paramount in a zero [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). While the [net investment](../n/net_investment.md) is zero, the strategy still involves various types of risks including [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md), and [model risk](../m/model_risk.md). Algorithmic traders employ various [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques such as [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [dynamic hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md), and [diversification](../d/diversification.md) to mitigate potential losses.

#### Technology and Infrastructure

High-speed computing and low-latency [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) are essential for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies like zero investment strategies. Traders use advanced hardware and software to ensure that trades are executed with minimal delay and at optimal prices. This includes utilizing direct [market](../m/market.md) access (DMA) to exchanges, co-locating servers close to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) data centers, and employing high-frequency trading platforms.

#### Data and Analytics

Access to high-quality [market](../m/market.md) data and analytical tools is crucial for identifying trading opportunities. This includes historical price data, [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md), [order book](../o/order_book.md) information, and newsfeeds. Algorithmic traders employ sophisticated [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models to uncover patterns and correlations in the data that can be exploited for zero investment strategies.
