# Zone Recovery

Zone recovery is a trading approach that uses a series of trades within a defined price zone to recover from losses. It often involves scaling positions as price moves against the initial trade.

## Core idea
The strategy defines a price range and places multiple orders within that range. If the initial position loses, additional positions are opened at predefined levels to reduce the average entry price and target a recovery move.

## Example
A trader buys at 100 and defines a recovery zone down to 95. If price falls, the trader adds at 98 and 96. When price rebounds to the average entry, the combined position can break even or profit.

## Risks
Zone recovery increases exposure as price moves against the position, which can lead to large losses if the market trends strongly. It requires strict limits and is not suitable for all traders.

## Practical notes
The approach is similar in risk profile to grid and martingale methods. Clear risk caps and exit rules are essential.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Zone Recovery and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Zone Recovery as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Zone Recovery, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Zone Recovery. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Zone Recovery alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
