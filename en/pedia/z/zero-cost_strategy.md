# Zero-Cost Strategy

A zero-cost strategy, also known as a costless [collar](../c/collar.md) or zero-cost [collar](../c/collar.md), is a popular financial [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) investments or to improve the [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) profile of a portfolio without incurring any upfront cost. In essence, it involves the combination of buying and selling financial instruments in such a way that the net cost to the [trader](../t/trader.md) is zero. This strategy can be particularly useful in managing risks in volatile markets, as it helps to protect against potential losses while still allowing for some [upside](../u/upside.md) gains.

## Basic Concept and Components

A zero-cost strategy typically involves a combination of [options](../o/options.md) and/or fixed-[income](../i/income.md) instruments. The basic idea is to pair the purchase of one [security](../s/security.md) with the [sale](../s/sale.md) of another, such that the premiums [offset](../o/offset.md) each other. Here are some common components used in zero-cost strategies:

### 1. Options

[Options](../o/options.md) are [derivative](../d/derivative.md) securities that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price within a specified time frame. They are commonly used in zero-cost strategies due to their flexibility. The two primary types of [options](../o/options.md) involved in zero-cost strategies are:

- **Call [Options](../o/options.md)**: These give the holder the right to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md)**: These give the holder the right to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### 2. Swaps

Swaps are [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contracts through which two parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) cash flows or other financial instruments over a specified period. They are often used in fixed-[income](../i/income.md) zero-cost strategies, such as [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) or [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps.

### 3. Collar

A [collar](../c/collar.md) is a common zero-cost strategy involving [options](../o/options.md). It is constructed by holding a long position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), while simultaneously buying a [protective put](../p/protective_put.md) option and selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md). The premiums received from selling the [call option](../c/call_option.md) [offset](../o/offset.md) the cost of purchasing the [put option](../p/put.md), resulting in zero or minimal net cost.

### 4. Equity Linked Notes (ELNs)

[Equity](../e/equity.md)-linked notes are structured financial products that combine the features of bonds and [options](../o/options.md). These notes [offer](../o/offer.md) returns linked to the performance of a particular [equity](../e/equity.md) or a basket of equities. By structuring ELNs with embedded [options](../o/options.md), investors can achieve a zero-cost [hedge](../h/hedge.md).

## Zero-Cost Collar Strategy: Detailed Example

A zero-cost [collar](../c/collar.md) is one of the most straightforward illustrations of a zero-cost strategy. Here’s a step-by-step example of how a zero-cost [collar](../c/collar.md) works:

1. **[Hold](../h/hold.md) the [Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: Assume an [investor](../i/investor.md) holds [shares](../s/shares.md) of a company, say XYZ Inc., currently trading at $100 per share.

2. **Buy a [Put Option](../p/put.md)**: The [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) lower than the current stock price, for instance, $95. This [put option](../p/put.md) provides the right to sell the stock at $95, acting as protection against a decline in the share price below this level.

3. **Sell a [Call Option](../c/call_option.md)**: To [offset](../o/offset.md) the cost of buying the [put option](../p/put.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) sells a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) higher than the current stock price, for instance, $105. This [call option](../c/call_option.md) obligates the [investor](../i/investor.md) to sell the stock at $105 if the share price exceeds this level before the option expires.

4. **Resulting P&L Profile**: The [premium](../p/premium.md) received from selling the [call option](../c/call_option.md) typically equals the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid for the [put option](../p/put.md). This results in no net cost to the [investor](../i/investor.md), hence the term "zero-cost [collar](../c/collar.md)." The P&L profile would look like this:
 - If the stock price falls below $95, the [investor](../i/investor.md) is protected by the [put option](../p/put.md).
 - If the stock price rises above $105, the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s gains are capped at $105 due to the [call option](../c/call_option.md).

## Applications and Benefits

### 1. Risk Management

Zero-cost strategies are primarily employed for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). By setting predefined levels of [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward, investors can protect against significant losses while still participating in potential gains. This makes zero-cost strategies invaluable tools during periods of high [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### 2. Enhancing Returns

Apart from hedging, zero-cost strategies can be designed to enhance returns. For instance, in a zero-cost [collar](../c/collar.md), even though gains are capped, investors can still benefit from the [premium](../p/premium.md) received from selling the [call option](../c/call_option.md), which can contribute to overall returns.

### 3. No Upfront Cost

As the name suggests, zero-cost strategies do not require any upfront expenditure. This makes them attractive for investors and traders operating under [budget](../b/budget.md) constraints, or those seeking to implement a cost-effective hedging strategy.

### 4. Diversification

Implementing zero-cost strategies can provide a means of achieving [diversification](../d/diversification.md). By utilizing various [options](../o/options.md) combinations or financial instruments, investors can create a portfolio with a better [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) profile.

## Popular Tools and Platforms

Many financial platforms and tools facilitate the implementation of zero-cost strategies. Here are a few notable ones:

### 1. Bloomberg Terminal

## Limitations and Risks

While zero-cost strategies [offer](../o/offer.md) numerous benefits, they come with certain limitations and risks that investors should be aware of:

### 1. Opportunity Cost

By capping potential gains through the [sale](../s/sale.md) of call [options](../o/options.md), investors may miss out on substantial [upside](../u/upside.md) if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price soars. This is the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off for gaining downside protection.

### 2. Complexity

Zero-cost strategies involving [options](../o/options.md) can be complex and may require a solid understanding of [options](../o/options.md) pricing, [greeks](../g/greeks.md), and [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). Investors without sufficient knowledge or experience may find it challenging to implement these strategies effectively.

### 3. Liquidity Risk

The [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of [options](../o/options.md) and other [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) used in zero-cost strategies can vary. Illiquid markets may result in unfavorable pricing or difficulty in executing trades at desired levels.

### 4. Counterparty Risk

When entering into [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contracts, such as [options](../o/options.md) or swaps, there is always the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) may [default](../d/default.md). Ensuring strong [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) is crucial.

## Conclusion

A zero-cost strategy provides an elegant solution for investors seeking to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) risks or enhance returns without incurring upfront costs. By carefully selecting and balancing financial instruments, such as [options](../o/options.md) or structured products, investors can create customized strategies tailored to their [risk](../r/risk.md) appetite and investment goals. While the concept offers significant benefits, it is equally important to understand the associated risks and complexities. With the right knowledge, tools, and careful planning, zero-cost strategies can be potent additions to an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s arsenal, providing a [robust](../r/robust.md) means of navigating [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
