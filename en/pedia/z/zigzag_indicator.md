# Zigzag Indicator

The zigzag indicator is a chart tool that filters out small price moves to highlight significant swings. It connects pivot highs and lows based on a chosen percentage or point threshold.

## How it works
- Set a minimum price change threshold, such as 5 percent.
- The indicator ignores moves smaller than the threshold.
- It draws lines connecting swing highs and lows that exceed the threshold.

## Uses
- Identifying swing structure and trend direction.
- Simplifying price action for wave analysis.
- Marking potential support and resistance pivots.

## Example
A trader sets a 3 percent zigzag on a daily chart. Only swings larger than 3 percent are shown, making the trend easier to see.

## Practical notes
Zigzag is a retrospective tool that repaints as new data appears. It should not be used for direct signals without additional confirmation.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Zigzag Indicator and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Zigzag Indicator as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Zigzag Indicator, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Zigzag Indicator. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Zigzag Indicator alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
