# Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW)

A [Negotiable](../n/negotiable.md) [Order](../o/order.md) of [Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) (NOW) account is a type of [bank](../b/bank.md) account that allows the account holder to write drafts against the [money](../m/money.md) held in the account. These drafts function much like checks, permitting the holder to withdraw funds in [order](../o/order.md) to pay for goods and services. NOW accounts were introduced in the United States in the 1970s as a way to bypass federal regulations that prohibited the [payment](../p/payment.md) of [interest](../i/interest.md) on [demand deposit](../d/demand_deposit.md) accounts, essentially [offering](../o/offering.md) an [interest](../i/interest.md)-bearing [checking account](../c/checking_account.md). The history, mechanism, advantages, and regulatory environment of NOW accounts can provide a comprehensive understanding of their significance in the financial landscape.

## History and Background

The concept of NOW accounts emerged in response to Regulation Q, a federal regulation that set ceilings on the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates that banks could [offer](../o/offer.md) to depositors and prohibited the [payment](../p/payment.md) of [interest](../i/interest.md) on [demand](../d/demand.md) deposits (such as checking accounts). The regulation was established during the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) to maintain the stability of banks by controlling the [interest](../i/interest.md) they paid on deposits, thus preventing excessively risky behaviors. However, by the 1970s, [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) had changed, and consumers were looking for more profitable and flexible banking [options](../o/options.md).

In 1972, the Consumer Savings [Bank](../b/bank.md) in Worcester, Massachusetts, introduced the first NOW account. The idea quickly gained traction because it provided account holders with the ability to earn [interest](../i/interest.md) on their deposits while retaining the convenience of writing checks. The [Depository](../d/depository.md) Institutions [Deregulation](../d/deregulation.md) and Monetary Control Act of 1980 eventually permitted the nationwide use of NOW accounts, significantly altering the banking landscape in favor of account holders.

## Mechanism of NOW Accounts

A NOW account essentially combines the features of a [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) and a [checking account](../c/checking_account.md). The [principal](../p/principal.md) mechanism includes:

### Interest Payment

Unlike traditional checking accounts, which typically do not pay [interest](../i/interest.md), NOW accounts [offer](../o/offer.md) a modest [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on the deposited funds. The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is generally lower than that offered by savings accounts but higher than the zero [interest](../i/interest.md) characteristic of most standard checking accounts.

### Draft Writing

Account holders can write drafts against their deposits, similar to writing checks. The drafts serve as a [negotiable](../n/negotiable.md) instrument, instructing the [bank](../b/bank.md) to pay the specified amount to the holder of the draft or another designated party.

### Minimum Balance Requirements

To maintain a NOW account, banks often require a minimum balance to avoid fees. This minimum balance varies from one financial institution to another and can influence the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) applied to the account.

### Terms and Conditions

The terms and conditions of NOW accounts can vary widely among financial institutions. Some may limit the number of transactions per month without incurring fees, impose monthly maintenance fees if the minimum balance is not maintained, or set other parameters that govern the account's operation.

### Fund Accessibility

Funds in NOW accounts are typically accessible on [demand](../d/demand.md), much like a [checking account](../c/checking_account.md), providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and convenience for account holders. This means that, unlike certain types of investments or savings products, the depositor can use the funds at their discretion without significant [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) penalties.

## Advantages of NOW Accounts

The NOW account offers several advantages that make it an attractive option for consumers:

### Interest Earnings

The primary advantage is the ability to earn [interest](../i/interest.md) on deposits while still having the flexibility to write drafts. This provides an incentive for individuals and businesses to keep larger balances in their accounts, thus potentially increasing their total [earnings](../e/earnings.md) over time.

### Liquidity and Flexibility

NOW accounts [offer](../o/offer.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) similar to that of checking accounts, allowing account holders to access their funds easily. The ability to write drafts means that the funds can be used to pay bills, make purchases, or be transferred to other accounts, providing significant flexibility.

### FDIC Insurance

Most NOW accounts are insured by the Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FDIC), up to the standard limit (currently $250,000 per depositor, per insured [bank](../b/bank.md), for each account ownership category). This [insurance](../i/insurance.md) adds a layer of [security](../s/security.md) for depositors, making NOW accounts a safe place to store funds.

### Financial Management

By combining features of both savings and checking accounts, NOW accounts help individuals and businesses manage their finances more efficiently. They can earn [interest](../i/interest.md) on their funds while still having the ability to write checks and pay for expenses as needed.

## Regulatory Environment

The regulatory environment governing NOW accounts has evolved since their introduction. Key regulations and acts that influence the structure and function of NOW accounts include:

### Regulation Q

Initially, Regulation Q prohibited the [payment](../p/payment.md) of [interest](../i/interest.md) on [demand](../d/demand.md) deposits. However, NOW accounts were designed to circumvent this regulation by technically classifying the drafts as [negotiable](../n/negotiable.md) orders of [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) rather than checks, thereby allowing banks to pay [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980

This act gradually phased out Regulation Q and allowed NOW accounts to be offered nationwide. The removal of [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) ceilings and the [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of NOW account availability significantly altered the competitive landscape for banking products.

### Regulation D

Regulation D places restrictions on the types of transactions that can be conducted through NOW accounts in regards to [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md) for [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions. Specifically, it ensures that NOW accounts are not used in a manner that conflicts with the regulation’s intent concerning the reserve requirement ratio for [transaction](../t/transaction.md) accounts.

### Consumer Protections

Various consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Savings Act (TISA), also apply to NOW accounts. TISA requires financial institutions to provide clear and accurate information about the terms and conditions of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) accounts, including NOW accounts, thereby protecting consumers from misleading practices.

## Comparison with Other Accounts

To understand NOW accounts more comprehensively, it is helpful to compare them with other types of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) accounts, specifically checking and savings accounts.

### Checking Accounts

- **[Interest](../i/interest.md)**: Traditional checking accounts typically do not pay [interest](../i/interest.md), whereas NOW accounts do.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Both checking and NOW accounts provide high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), with funds accessible on [demand](../d/demand.md).
- **Minimum Balance**: NOW accounts often have minimum balance requirements to earn [interest](../i/interest.md) and avoid fees, while many checking accounts do not.

### Savings Accounts

- **[Interest](../i/interest.md)**: Savings accounts generally [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to NOW accounts.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Savings accounts limit the number of withdrawals or transfers (often to six per month) without penalties, while NOW accounts [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility in [fund](../f/fund.md) accessibility.
- **Minimum Balance**: Both types of accounts may require a minimum balance to avoid fees.

## Examples of Institutions Offering NOW Accounts
