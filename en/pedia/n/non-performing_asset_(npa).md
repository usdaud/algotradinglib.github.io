# Non-Performing Asset (NPA)

A Non-Performing [Asset](../a/asset.md) (NPA) is a term used primarily in the banking and [finance](../f/finance.md) sectors to describe loans or advances for which the [principal](../p/principal.md) or [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) has remained overdue for a period of 90 days or more. The concept is crucial for maintaining the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of banks and other lending institutions as it directly impacts their profitability, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and regulatory compliance. NPAs are a significant [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of an institution's [asset](../a/asset.md) quality and can affect the broader economic landscape by influencing lending behaviors and financial stability.

## Types of NPAs

### 1. **Substandard Assets**
Substandard assets are those which have remained non-performing for a period less than or equal to 12 months. These assets pose a higher [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to standard assets due to their deteriorated [credit](../c/credit.md) quality. The financial institutions usually take special [note](../n/note.md) of such assets to minimize potential losses and may start provisioning as a buffer against such risks.

### 2. **Doubtful Assets**
Doubtful assets are those which have remained in the substandard category for 12 months. The collection of dues is highly questionable and full [repayment](../r/repayment.md) of the [principal](../p/principal.md) is not likely based on current conditions. This category often requires significant provisioning, reflecting the increased [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).

### 3. **Loss Assets**
Loss assets are identified by the [bank](../b/bank.md) or internal/external auditors as uncollectible and of such little [value](../v/value.md) that their continued presence on the books cannot be justified, although there may be some residual recovery [value](../v/value.md). These assets require 100% provisioning.

## Causes for NPAs

### Poor Risk Management
Poor evaluation of a borrower’s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) can lead to uninformed lending decisions, which increase the likelihood of the loans turning into NPAs. Inadequate [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment frameworks or failure to follow established [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) guidelines can contribute significantly to this [issue](../i/issue.md).

### Economic Downturn
A downturn in the [economy](../e/economy.md), such as a [recession](../r/recession.md), can adversely affect businesses and individuals, reducing their ability to service loans. [Economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md) greatly influence the [risk](../r/risk.md) of NPAs, with elevated levels observed during economic slumps.

### High Borrower Leverage
When borrowers take on excessive [debt](../d/debt.md) compared to their [income](../i/income.md) or assets, their ability to service the [debt](../d/debt.md) diminishes. High [leverage](../l/leverage.md) can occur in both personal and corporate scenarios, leading to increased NPAs.

### Regulatory Changes
Changes in regulations can sometimes adversely affect the sectors to which banks have large exposure. For example, stricter environmental regulations can impact industries like [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) or [mining](../m/mining.md), reducing their profitability and thereby their ability to service loans.

### Fraudulent Practices
Instances of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) or misrepresentation by either the borrower or internal employees can lead to loans becoming NPAs. This could include false documentation, improper utilization of funds, and [collusion](../c/collusion.md) between [bank](../b/bank.md) officials and borrowers.

## Impact of NPAs

### Profitability
High levels of NPAs can significantly erode the profitability of a financial institution. Since NPAs do not generate [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) and their provisioning requirements eat into the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s reserves, the [bottom line](../b/bottom_line.md) suffers.

### Liquidity
NPAs reduce the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of a financial institution as funds that could be used for new lending or investment are locked up in non-performing loans. This affects the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s ability to service withdrawable accounts and impacts the overall financial ecosystem.

### Capital Requirement
Banks with high levels of NPAs are required to maintain higher provisioning, which affects their [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy ratio (CAR). A lower CAR can limit a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s ability to lend and grow its [business](../b/business.md), as regulatory bodies often impose restrictions on institutions with inadequate [capital](../c/capital.md) buffers.

### Shareholder Confidence
High NPAs can erode [market](../m/market.md) confidence and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment, causing a decline in the share [value](../v/value.md) of the institution. This, in turn, affects the ability of banks to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) from the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

### Broader Economic Impact
For a country, high levels of NPAs in the banking sector can stifle [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) by reducing the [credit](../c/credit.md) available for businesses and consumers. This can slow down investments, lead to [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), and create a [ripple](../r/ripple.md) effect throughout the [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Managing and Reducing NPAs

### Improved Risk Management
Enhancing [risk management techniques](../r/risk_management_techniques.md), including [robust](../r/robust.md) [credit](../c/credit.md) [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) processes, stringent monitoring, and timely review of [loan](../l/loan.md) accounts, can help mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of NPAs.

### Technological Interventions
Implementing advanced technologies such as [Artificial Intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for [predictive analytics](../p/predictive_analytics.md) can help in early identification of potential NPAs. These technologies can analyze vast amounts of data to predict future [repayment](../r/repayment.md) behaviors.

### Restructuring and Settlement
Providing [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) [options](../o/options.md) for stressed assets, such as extending [repayment](../r/repayment.md) periods, converting loans into [equity](../e/equity.md), or other modifications, can sometimes enable borrowers to service their [debt](../d/debt.md), thereby reducing NPAs.

### Legal Recourse
Countries have various legal frameworks, such as [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) and [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) codes, to address NPAs. Financial institutions can utilize these legal avenues to recover dues efficiently. For instance, the [Insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) and [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) Code (IBC) in India has provided a significant boost to NPA resolution.

### Recovery Agencies
Engaging specialized agencies for the recovery of dues can also prove effective. These agencies possess the expertise and resources to negotiate with defaulters and recover outstanding loans.

### Government Initiatives
Governments often step in with regulatory measures and financial assistance to help banks clean up their books. This can include [recapitalization](../r/recapitalization.md) of banks, providing guarantees for bad loans, and setting up bad banks to take over NPAs.

## Global Scenario

### United States
In the United States, the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008 saw a significant rise in NPAs. The government's response included [bailout](../b/bailout.md) packages for banks and financial institutions, stringent regulations, and better [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices to forestall future occurrences.

### Europe
European banks faced a surge in NPAs post the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) and the subsequent [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) crisis. Countries like Greece and Italy saw NPAs rising to alarming levels. The European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) (ECB) and national governments have since then taken stringent measures to reduce the same.

### India
India has faced its own challenges with NPAs, particularly in public sector banks. Various initiatives such as the [Insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) and [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) Code (IBC), [Asset](../a/asset.md) Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), and stringent regulatory measures by the Reserve [Bank](../b/bank.md) of India (RBI) have been implemented to tackle this [issue](../i/issue.md).

### China
China's rapid economic [expansion](../e/expansion.md) has been accompanied by a rise in NPAs, especially in the corporate sector. The Chinese government and the People's [Bank](../b/bank.md) of China have been endeavoring to curb the surge through regulatory changes, strengthening of [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment frameworks, and establishment of [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) companies (AMCs) to deal with bad loans.

## Legislative and Regulatory Measures

### Basel Norms
Globally, banks adhere to Basel norms which prescribe minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements to mitigate [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), including the [risk](../r/risk.md) posed by NPAs. [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), the latest set of regulations, aims to strengthen [bank capital](../b/bank_capital.md) requirements by increasing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and decreasing [leverage](../l/leverage.md).

### National Regulations
Each country has its regulatory framework to manage NPAs. For instance, in India, the RBI has laid out comprehensive guidelines for [asset](../a/asset.md) classification, provisioning, and recovery. Similarly, the Office of the Comptroller of the [Currency](../c/currency.md) (OCC) in the United States provides frameworks for the classification of NPAs and the provisioning of the same.

## Conclusion

Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) serve as a crucial metric for the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of lending institutions and have far-reaching impacts on their operations and on the [economy](../e/economy.md) at large. Effective management and reduction of NPAs are essential for the stability and growth of the banking sector. While [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), technological interventions, legal frameworks, and government initiatives play notable roles in addressing NPAs, a vigilant approach towards [credit](../c/credit.md) evaluation and monitoring continues to be of paramount importance. The mechanisms to deal with NPAs are continuously evolving in response to changing economic environments and regulatory landscapes, making it a dynamic and critical aspect of financial management.
