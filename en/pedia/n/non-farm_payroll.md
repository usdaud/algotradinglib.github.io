# Non-Farm Payroll

Non-Farm [Payroll](../p/payroll.md) (NFP) is a key [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) for the United States [economy](../e/economy.md) that represents the total number of paid U.S. workers of any [business](../b/business.md), with the exception of employees of general government, private [household employees](../h/household_employee.md), employees of nonprofit organizations that provide assistance to individuals, and farm employees. The NFP data is collected and compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor [Statistics](../s/statistics.md).

## Introduction to Non-Farm Payroll (NFP)

Non-Farm [Payroll](../p/payroll.md) data is a critical [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) and is closely watched by economists, investors, and policymakers. The data is released monthly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor [Statistics](../s/statistics.md) (BLS) as part of the broader Employment Situation report. The release is typically on the first Friday of each month at 8:30 AM Eastern Time and includes the total number of non-farm payrolls added or lost, the national [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md), average hourly [earnings](../e/earnings.md), and several other vital metrics related to the U.S. [labor market](../l/labor_market.md).

## Importance of Non-Farm Payroll

### Market Impact

The release of the Non-Farm [Payroll](../p/payroll.md) report can have significant immediate effects on [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). [Currency](../c/currency.md) markets, stock markets, and [bond](../b/bond.md) markets often see sharp movements as traders and investors react to the data. For instance, a higher-than-expected NFP figure generally signals economic strength, prompting rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, which can lead to a stronger U.S. dollar and falling [bond](../b/bond.md) prices. Conversely, a lower-than-expected figure might indicate economic weakness, potentially resulting in lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, a weaker dollar, and rising [bond](../b/bond.md) prices.

### Federal Reserve Policy

The Federal Reserve closely monitors NFP data as part of its assessment of economic health and [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) conditions. The data significantly influences the Fed’s [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) decisions, including [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) adjustments and [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) measures. A strong NFP report may lead to tighter [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) to prevent the [economy](../e/economy.md) from overheating, while weak data might prompt a more accommodative policy stance to stimulate growth.

### Economic Health Indicator

NFP figures are considered a broad [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of economic health. They provide insights into the strength of [business](../b/business.md) activity, consumer spending capabilities, and overall economic stability. High job creation figures suggest [robust](../r/robust.md) [business](../b/business.md) conditions and increased consumer spending, driving [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). Conversely, low job creation signals economic weaknesses and may lead to reduced consumer spending and economic contraction.

## Components and Interpretation

### Headline NFP Number

The headline number in the NFP report indicates the total number of net non-farm jobs added or lost during the previous month. Analysts compare this figure to forecasts and previous months’ data to gauge [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) trends.

### Unemployment Rate

Accompanying the NFP data is the national [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md), which measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment. While the NFP number provides raw job creation data, the [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) contextualizes this information within the broader labor [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

### Average Hourly Earnings

Average hourly [earnings](../e/earnings.md) data is critical as it reflects changes in wage growth. Rising wages generally indicate increasing consumer [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md), potentially leading to higher [inflation](../i/inflation.md). [Market](../m/market.md) participants scrutinize this data for signs of inflationary pressure.

#### Breaking Down Average Hourly Earnings:
- **Monthly Change**: This shows the change in average hourly [earnings](../e/earnings.md) from the previous month.
- **Annual Change**: This indicates the change compared to the same month in the prior year, providing insights into longer-term wage trends.

### Labor Force Participation Rate

This statistic reflects the percentage of the [working-age population](../w/working-age_population.md) that is either employed or actively seeking work. Changes in labor force participation can impact the [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) and provide deeper insights into labor [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

## Trading the NFP

### Strategies

Given the NFP report’s significant [market](../m/market.md) impact, many traders develop strategies specifically for trading around its release.

#### Pre-release positioning

Some traders position themselves before the NFP release based on forecasts and other [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), anticipating [market](../m/market.md) reactions.

#### Post-release reaction

Others wait for the data release and then react to the resulting [market](../m/market.md) movements, utilizing strategies like [breakout trading](../b/breakout_trading.md) or [retracement](../r/retracement.md) entries based on the initial reaction.

### Risk Management

Due to the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) surrounding the NFP report, [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial. Traders often use tight [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) based on [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and limit orders to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.

## Algorithmic Trading and NFP

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

Algorithmic and high-frequency trading firms frequently employ sophisticated algorithms to exploit the rapid price movements immediately following the NFP release. These algorithms can process and react to the data in milliseconds, executing trades at speeds beyond human capability.

### Machine Learning

Some firms and trading desks incorporate [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models to predict NFP outcomes and [market](../m/market.md) reactions. These models analyze vast amounts of economic data, including previous NFP reports, to generate predictions and [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).

## Accessing NFP Data

### Bureau of Labor Statistics

The primary source of NFP data is the U.S. Bureau of Labor [Statistics](../s/statistics.md), available on their website [here](https://www.bls.gov/).

### Financial News Platforms

Platforms like [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), [Reuters](../r/reuters.md), and various financial news websites provide real-time updates, expert analysis, and historical data related to the NFP report.

### Economic Calendars

Many trading platforms and financial websites feature economic calendars that include NFP release dates, forecasts, previous results, and real-time updates. These calendars are crucial for traders and investors to stay informed.
