# Neural Network Backtesting

Neural network [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) is a critical process in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) where historical [market](../m/market.md) data is used to evaluate the performance of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) driven by [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md). The aim of [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) is to understand how well a neural network-based [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) would have performed in past [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This helps in validating the robustness and profitability of the strategy before deploying it in real, live trading environments.

### Neural Networks in Trading

[Neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md), specifically [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) models, have gained traction in recent years due to their ability to process large volumes of data and identify complex patterns. In trading, these models can be used to predict stock prices, classify [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), optimize portfolios, and more. Key types of [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) used in trading include:

1. **[Feedforward Neural Networks](../f/feedforward_neural_networks.md) (FNN)**: These are the simplest type of [artificial neural networks](../a/artificial_neural_networks.md) in which connections between the nodes do not form a cycle. They are mainly used for predicting future price movements based on historical data.

2. **Recurrent [Neural Networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) (RNN)**: RNNs are [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) with memory that can [handle](../h/handle.md) sequences of data. They are beneficial in time-series [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) because they consider both current and past information.

3. **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**: LSTMs are a type of RNN designed to remember information for longer periods. They overcome the vanishing gradient problem, making them effective for predicting stock prices, which can be dependent on long-term patterns.

4. **Convolutional [Neural Networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) (CNN)**: Originally designed for image processing, CNNs have found applications in trading by identifying patterns through different layers of processing, which can be transferred to analyzing features of trading data.

5. **[Generative Adversarial Networks](../g/generative_adversarial_networks.md) (GANs)**: GANs consist of two [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md), a generator and a discriminator, working in opposition. In trading, GANs can generate synthetic data to augment limited datasets, providing more training data for models.

### Backtesting Frameworks and Tools

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) a neural network trading model involves several steps and requires suitable frameworks and tools. Notable frameworks include:

1. **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)**: An [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platform that supports [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and live trading. It provides cloud-based [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) and integrates with numerous datasets. [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/)

2. **[Backtrader](../b/backtrader.md)**: A Python-based [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) library that offers flexibility in strategy development and extensive data sources. [Backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com/)

3. **Zipline**: An [open](../o/open.md)-source [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) library written in Python and maintained by Quantopian. It is used in conjunction with Python and Pandas for efficient [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md). [Zipline](https://www.zipline.io/)

4. **[Keras](../k/keras.md) and [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md)**: [Keras](../k/keras.md), in conjunction with [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md), is often used to build and train [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md). These frameworks facilitate the integration of [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) models with [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) libraries like Zipline and [Backtrader](../b/backtrader.md). [Keras](https://keras.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

### Backtesting Steps

The process of [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) a neural network-based [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) involves several steps:

#### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect historical [market](../m/market.md) data including price, [volume](../v/volume.md), and possibly additional indicators like moving averages, RSI, etc. This data needs preprocessing, including normalization, handling missing values, and creating sequences if using RNNs or LSTMs:

```python
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_prices.csv')

# Preprocess data
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)
data['Close'] = data['Close'].pct_change().dropna()  # Calculate returns
```

#### 2. Model Training

Train the neural network on the historical data. This step includes defining the architecture, compiling the model, and training it using the training dataset:

```python
from [keras](../k/keras.md).models [import](../i/import.md) Sequential
from [keras](../k/keras.md).layers [import](../i/import.md) Dense, LSTM

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(60, 1)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dense(units=1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32)
```

#### 3. Strategy Definition

Define the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) based on the model's predictions. The strategy might involve entering or exiting trades based on specific threshold levels:

```python
def trading_strategy(predicted_prices, actual_prices, threshold=0.02):
    signals = []
    for pred, actual in zip(predicted_prices, actual_prices):
        if pred - actual > threshold:
            signals.append('buy')
        elif actual - pred > threshold:
            signals.append('sell')
        else:
            signals.append('[hold](../h/hold.md)')
    [return](../r/return.md) signals

signals = trading_strategy(model.predict(X_test), y_test)
```

#### 4. Performance Evaluation

Evaluate the strategyâ€™s performance by calculating key metrics such as total returns, [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), max [drawdown](../d/drawdown.md), and other relevant [statistics](../s/statistics.md):

```python
initial_balance = 10000
balance = initial_balance

for signal, actual in zip(signals, y_test):
    if signal == 'buy':
        balance += balance * actual
    elif signal == 'sell':
        balance -= balance * actual

total_return = (balance - initial_balance) / initial_balance
print(f"[Total Return](../t/total_return.md): {total_return * 100:.2f}%")
```

### Challenges and Considerations

1. **Data Quality**: Ensure the historical data is accurate and granular enough. Poor data can lead to incorrect strategy validation.

2. **[Overfitting](../o/overfitting.md)**: Avoid [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md) by using techniques like cross-validation. Overfitted models perform well on training data but poorly on out-of-sample data.

3. **[Look-ahead Bias](../l/look-ahead_bias.md)**: Ensure that future data is not used in model training or decision-making processes. This can be managed by properly splitting datasets into training and testing periods.

4. **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: Include trading fees and [slippage](../s/slippage.md) in the [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) to obtain realistic results.

5. **Regime Changes**: [Market](../m/market.md) conditions change over time. Strategies must be [robust](../r/robust.md) enough to adapt to different [market](../m/market.md) regimes.

### Real-world Applications

Several firms and platforms utilize neural network-based [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) to refine and deploy [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). For instance:

- **Turing AI**: A company that provides AI-driven investment solutions, using neural network [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) for strategy validation. [Turing AI](https://www.turing.com/)

- **[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds**: Various [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds use proprietary neural network [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) frameworks to evaluate and implement high-frequency [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Conclusion

Neural network [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) is an essential practice in modern [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) that aids in verifying the effectiveness and robustness of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) before live deployment. By leveraging powerful [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) frameworks and comprehensive [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) libraries, traders and firms can enhance their decision-making processes, potentially leading to more profitable and resilient [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
