# Non-Financial Market Data

## Introduction
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as algo-trading, refers to the use of computer algorithms to automate trading decisions and actions in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). While the primary inputs for these algorithms have traditionally been financial data like stock prices, [volume](../v/volume.md), and [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md), an increasing number of traders and firms are incorporating non-financial [market](../m/market.md) data into their algorithms to [gain](../g/gain.md) an edge in predicting [market](../m/market.md) movements and identifying opportunities. 

Non-financial [market](../m/market.md) data encompasses a broad [range](../r/range.md) of data sources that are not directly related to the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) but can impact them. This can include [social media](../s/social_media.md) activity, news articles, weather data, economic reports, and many other types of information. By leveraging this additional data, traders aim to [gain](../g/gain.md) more comprehensive insights and improve the performance of their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Types of Non-Financial Market Data

### Social Media Data
[Social media](../s/social_media.md) platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn generate massive amounts of data every day. This data can be analyzed to gauge public sentiment, trends, and potential [market](../m/market.md)-moving events. Firms like Dataminr (https://www.dataminr.com) specialize in providing real-time information from [social media](../s/social_media.md) that can affect [market](../m/market.md) prices.

### News Articles and Sentiment Analysis
News articles and media reports are essential sources of information. Algorithms can be designed to analyze the sentiment of news stories using [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP) techniques to determine whether the news is positive or negative and how it might impact specific [stocks](../s/stock.md) or sectors. A company like [RavenPack](../r/ravenpack.md) (https://www.[ravenpack](../r/ravenpack.md).com) offers analytics services that process news data for trading purposes.

### Weather Data
Weather conditions can have significant impacts on various industries such as agriculture, energy, and retail. Weather data can be used in [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to predict [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) disruptions, [commodity](../c/commodity.md) price changes, and more. Companies like The Weather Company, an IBM [Business](../b/business.md) (https://[business](../b/business.md).weather.com), provide detailed and precise weather data for this purpose.

### Economic Indicators
While some [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) like [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) figures are traditionally considered financial data, broader [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) like consumer confidence, [retail sales](../r/retail_sales.md), and industrial production can also be crucial inputs for algo-[trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Many of these indicators can be sourced from government and private reports.

### Geopolitical Events
Events such as elections, legislative changes, and international conflicts can have a profound impact on [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Data on these events can be fed into algorithms to predict [market](../m/market.md) reactions. Firms like Stratfor (https://worldview.stratfor.com) provide geopolitical intelligence that can be integrated into [trading models](../t/trading_models.md).

### Satellite Imagery
Advances in satellite technology have made it possible to collect data on a [range](../r/range.md) of factors, from agricultural yields to retail traffic. Companies like Orbital Insight (https://orbitalinsight.com) use machine [learning algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) to analyze satellite imagery and provide actionable insights that can be used in [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Corporate Announcements and M&A Activity
Algorithms can be designed to process and react to corporate announcements such as [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, product launches, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A). This data often moves stock prices and can be critical for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) strategies.

## Methodologies for Integrating Non-Financial Market Data

### Data Acquisition and Cleaning
The first step in leveraging non-financial [market](../m/market.md) data is acquiring and cleaning it. This can involve scraping data from public websites, purchasing data feeds, or subscribing to services that provide the required data. Cleaning the data involves handling missing values, normalizing formats, and ensuring consistency.

### Data Enrichment
Once the data is cleaned, it can be enriched by combining it with other datasets. For instance, [social media sentiment](../s/social_media_sentiment.md) data can be enriched with trading volumes to better understand the potential impact on the [market](../m/market.md).

### Feature Engineering
In feature engineering, relevant features are extracted or transformed from raw data to be used in [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models. For example, sentiment scores from news articles can be converted into numerical features that algorithms can use.

### Model Training and Testing
With enriched and pre-processed data, the next step is to train [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models. These models can [range](../r/range.md) from simple linear regressions to complex [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) architectures. They are trained on historical data and tested on validation datasets to ensure they generalize well to unseen data.

### Real-Time Processing
For algo-trading, real-time processing capabilities are crucial. This involves setting up pipelines and infrastructures that can ingest, process, and react to data in real-time. Technologies like Apache Kafka and Apache Flink are often used for real-time data processing.

### Backtesting and Simulation
Before deploying an algorithm in live markets, it is essential to backtest it against historical data to assess its performance. [Simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md) environments can also be used to evaluate how the algorithm would perform under different [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Deployment
Once the algorithm has been tested thoroughly, it can be deployed in a live [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md). Continuous monitoring and tweaking are necessary to ensure that the algorithm adapts to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Challenges in Using Non-Financial Market Data
