# New Low

A new low occurs when price falls below all prior prices over a defined period, such as a 52 week low. It can signal weakness or capitulation.

## Significance
- New lows can indicate strong selling pressure.
- They can trigger stop orders and forced selling.
- They can also precede mean reversion bounces if selling becomes exhausted.

## Example
A stock breaks below its 52 week low on heavy volume. Traders interpret this as a breakdown and may sell rallies.

## Practical notes
New lows are most informative when viewed with market breadth and sector context.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for New Low and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating New Low as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For New Low, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying New Low. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use New Low alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
