# Negative Interest Rate Policy (NIRP)

[Negative Interest Rate](../n/negative_interest_rate.md) Policy (NIRP) is an unconventional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tool used by central banks to incentivize lending and spending in an [economy](../e/economy.md) by setting [nominal](../n/nominal.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates below zero. This practice effectively means that banks are charged for holding [excess reserves](../e/excess_reserves.md) with the central [bank](../b/bank.md), encouraging them to lend more [money](../m/money.md) to businesses and consumers rather than [hoarding](../h/hoarding.md) cash.

## Introduction

NIRP emerged as a response to economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md) and deflationary pressures, particularly after the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). Central banks in several advanced economies have adopted NIRP to stimulate economic activity when traditional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) (i.e., lowering [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to zero) is insufficient.

## Mechanics of NIRP

Under normal circumstances, commercial banks [deposit](../d/deposit.md) their [excess reserves](../e/excess_reserves.md) with the central [bank](../b/bank.md) and earn [interest](../i/interest.md). However, under NIRP, the central [bank](../b/bank.md) sets a negative rate on these deposits, meaning banks must pay to keep their [money](../m/money.md) parked with the central [bank](../b/bank.md). This creates a financial incentive for banks to lend more to businesses and individuals, stimulating economic activity through increased spending and investment.

### Example

Consider a central [bank](../b/bank.md) that sets a [negative interest rate](../n/negative_interest_rate.md) of -0.5%. A [commercial bank](../c/commercial_bank.md) with $1 million in [excess reserves](../e/excess_reserves.md) would be required to pay $5,000 annually to the central [bank](../b/bank.md) to keep these reserves. To avoid this cost, the [commercial bank](../c/commercial_bank.md) would seek to lend or invest this [money](../m/money.md) elsewhere, ideally where it can generate a positive [return](../r/return.md).

## Historical Context and Adoption

Several central banks have adopted NIRP since the 2010s. The European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) (ECB), the [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Japan (BOJ), and the Swiss [National Bank](../n/national_bank.md) (SNB) are notable examples. Each of these institutions has implemented NIRP in response to prolonged periods of low [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md).

### European Central Bank (ECB)

In June 2014, the ECB lowered its [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [facility](../f/facility.md) rate to -0.10%, marking the first time a major central [bank](../b/bank.md) had set a negative rate. This move was part of a broader strategy to combat [deflation](../d/deflation.md) and revitalize the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) [economy](../e/economy.md), which was still recovering from the sovereign [debt](../d/debt.md) crisis.

### Bank of Japan (BOJ)

In January 2016, the BOJ introduced NIRP by setting the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on [excess reserves](../e/excess_reserves.md) at -0.10%. The decision aimed to stimulate [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and achieve the central [bank](../b/bank.md)'s 2% [inflation](../i/inflation.md) target, which had remained elusive despite various monetary easing measures.

-

### Swiss National Bank (SNB)

The SNB has employed negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates since January 2015, with the policy rate set at -0.75% as of 2023. The primary goal of this policy is to curb upward pressure on the Swiss franc, which can harm the country's [export](../e/export.md)-reliant [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Impacts and Consequences

The implementation of NIRP has led to several significant economic and financial consequences:

### Economic Stimulus

NIRP aims to stimulate economic activity by encouraging banks to lend more and consumers to spend more. This increased activity can help avert [deflation](../d/deflation.md) or stimulate a sluggish [economy](../e/economy.md) by boosting [demand](../d/demand.md) for goods and services.

### Exchange Rates

NIRP often leads to [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) of the local [currency](../c/currency.md), making exports more competitive. This can support the [export](../e/export.md) sector and improve the [trade](../t/trade.md) balance, contributing to [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

### Asset Prices

Lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates typically elevate the prices of financial assets such as [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds. Investors, seeking higher returns than those available on cash [holdings](../h/holdings.md), are likely to move their [money](../m/money.md) into riskier assets, driving up prices and fostering investment in various sectors.

### Bank Profitability

While NIRP can stimulate lending, it may also squeeze [bank](../b/bank.md) [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md). Banks earn less on loans and other [interest](../i/interest.md)-bearing assets relative to what they must pay out on deposits. This “[net interest margin](../n/net_interest_margin.md)” compression can lead to lower profitability, potentially encouraging banks to hike fees or cut costs elsewhere.

### Savers and Consumers

For consumers, NIRP can have mixed effects. Lower borrowing costs can make [financing](../f/financing.md) major purchases more affordable, but the returns on savings diminish, potentially discouraging thrift.

## Challenges and Criticisms

### Effectiveness

One major challenge with NIRP is its effectiveness in stimulating economic activity. Critics argue that simply making borrowing cheaper does not guarantee increased lending or spending, particularly in environments where businesses and consumers are more inclined to save.

### Financial Stability

Negative rates can spur [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking behavior as investors chase higher returns, potentially inflating [asset](../a/asset.md) [bubbles](../b/bubble.md). Additionally, prolonged periods of low profitability for banks could compromise the stability of the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md).

### Public Perception

NIRP might be unpopular among the public, especially savers who receive negligible or even negative returns on their deposits. This could lead to criticism of central [bank](../b/bank.md) policies and erode public [trust](../t/trust.md) in monetary institutions.

## Future Prospects

The use of NIRP remains a subject of debate among economists and policymakers. Depending on the macroeconomic environment, negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates could become a more common tool in central banks' arsenals, particularly in low-growth, low-[inflation](../i/inflation.md) contexts.

Advances in financial technology (fintech) could also influence the implementation and effects of NIRP. Enhanced [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) and digitally-driven financial services might improve the transmission mechanism of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), making tools like NIRP more effective.

Overall, while NIRP is a relatively new and unconventional policy, its adoption and impacts [warrant](../w/warrant.md) careful consideration as central banks navigate the complexities of modern economic challenges.
