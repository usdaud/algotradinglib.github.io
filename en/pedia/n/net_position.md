# Net Position

Net position is the total exposure in a security or portfolio after offsetting long and short positions. It reflects the directional bias of the account.

## Calculation
Net Position = Long Position - Short Position

A positive net position indicates net long exposure. A negative net position indicates net short exposure.

## Example
An account is long 1,500 shares and short 500 shares of the same stock. The net position is 1,000 shares long.

## Why it matters
Net position determines how the portfolio responds to price changes. It is also used for risk limits and regulatory reporting.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Net Position and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Net Position as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Net Position, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Net Position. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Net Position alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
