# Normative Economics

Normative [economics](../e/economics.md) is a perspective on [economics](../e/economics.md) that reflects normative, or subjective, judgments about what the [economy](../e/economy.md) should be like or what particular policy actions should be recommended to achieve a desirable goal. It is distinct from [positive economics](../p/positive_economics.md), which aims to describe and predict economic phenomena without making [value](../v/value.md) judgments.

### Understanding Normative Economics

Normative [economics](../e/economics.md) focuses on what ought to be rather than what is. This area of [economics](../e/economics.md) involves statements that express opinions about economic policies, systems, and outcomes based on personal [value](../v/value.md) systems, ethics, beliefs, and normative judgments. It deals with questions such as what economic goals society should pursue and what methods it should employ to achieve these goals.

Examples of normative economic statements include:
- "The government should increase the [minimum wage](../m/minimum_wage.md) to reduce [poverty](../p/poverty.md)."
- "We should improve the overall social [welfare](../w/welfare.md) by providing universal healthcare."

These statements reflect one's beliefs about the priorities and policies that should guide an [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Key Features

1. **[Value](../v/value.md) Judgments**: Normative [economics](../e/economics.md) is inherently subjective because it involves [value](../v/value.md) judgments. The recommendations or assessments made under normative [economics](../e/economics.md) are based on normative criteria, such as fairness, well-being, and [equity](../e/equity.md), which are inherently subjective and vary from person to person or society to society.

2. **Policy Recommendations**: Unlike [positive economics](../p/positive_economics.md), which describes economic phenomena or predicts outcomes of specific actions, normative [economics](../e/economics.md) is used to recommend policies. These recommendations aim to improve or change economic outcomes based on a particular set of values or normative goals.

3. **Ethical Foundations**: Normative [economics](../e/economics.md) is deeply rooted in ethical theories and principles. Different ethical frameworks can lead to different normative conclusions. For example, [utilitarianism](../u/utilitarianism.md), which seeks to maximize overall happiness, may make different economic recommendations compared to deontological ethics, which emphasizes duties and rights.

### Examples of Normative Economics in Policy Debates

Economic policy debates often feature a mix of positive and normative arguments. Below are some common debates where normative [economics](../e/economics.md) plays a crucial role:

1. **[Income](../i/income.md) Redistribution**: Discussions about [taxation](../t/taxation.md) and [welfare](../w/welfare.md) often hinge on normative arguments about fairness and [equity](../e/equity.md). For example, the debate over progressive [taxation](../t/taxation.md) versus flat [taxation](../t/taxation.md) is primarily normative, as it involves different views on how [income](../i/income.md) and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) should be distributed in society.

2. **Environmental Regulation**: Policies aimed at addressing climate change, such as carbon [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or cap-and-[trade](../t/trade.md) systems, are influenced by normative considerations of intergenerational [equity](../e/equity.md), the [value](../v/value.md) of biodiversity, and the ethical responsibility to reduce harm to future generations.

3. **Public Goods and Services**: Whether the government should provide certain goods or services, such as healthcare or education, is a normative question. Supporters may argue that these are basic rights and should be universally accessible, while opponents may argue for more [market](../m/market.md)-based solutions.

### Normative Frameworks in Economics

Several frameworks and theories guide normative economic analysis and policy recommendations:

1. **[Welfare Economics](../w/welfare_economics.md)**: This branch of [economics](../e/economics.md) evaluates the economic well-being of individuals in a society and often uses tools like [cost-benefit analysis](../c/cost-benefit_analysis_in_trading.md) to recommend policies that improve social [welfare](../w/welfare.md).

2. **Social Choice Theory**: This field studies collective decision-making and how individual preferences can be aggregated to make collective normative judgments. The work of economists like [Kenneth Arrow](../k/kenneth_arrow.md), who developed the Impossibility Theorem, is central to this theory.

3. **[Political Economy](../p/political_economy.md)**: This interdisciplinary approach combines [economics](../e/economics.md) with political science to understand how political institutions, the political environment, and the economic system influence each other. Normative [political economy](../p/political_economy.md) examines the role of ethical principles in shaping economic policy.

4. **Ethical Theories**: Normative [economics](../e/economics.md) often pulls from ethical theories such as [utilitarianism](../u/utilitarianism.md), which focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number, and Kantian ethics, which emphasizes rights and duties.

### Criticisms and Challenges

1. **Subjectivity**: A primary criticism of normative [economics](../e/economics.md) is that it is inherently subjective. Different individuals or societies may have different values and, hence, different normative perspectives on the same [issue](../i/issue.md). This plurality of views can lead to conflicting policy prescriptions.

2. **Bias**: Normative [economics](../e/economics.md) can be biased, as policymakers and economists may let their personal beliefs influence their recommendations. This bias can affect the objectivity and neutrality that [economics](../e/economics.md), as a science, strives to maintain.

3. **Operationalization**: Putting normative principles into practice is often challenging. Translating abstract ethical principles into concrete policy measures can be difficult, given the complexity of real-world economic systems and the potential unintended consequences of policies.

### Role in Modern Economic Discussions

Despite its challenges, normative [economics](../e/economics.md) plays a crucial role in shaping public policy and economic debates. As societies grapple with complex issues like inequality, climate change, and healthcare, normative [economics](../e/economics.md) helps frame these discussions and guide decision-making processes.

In academic settings, normative [economics](../e/economics.md) is often blended with [positive economics](../p/positive_economics.md) to create comprehensive analyses that can inform public policy. Research organizations, think tanks, and academic institutions frequently publish studies that combine empirical data ([positive economics](../p/positive_economics.md)) with normative analysis to make policy recommendations.

### Institutions and Think Tanks

Several institutions actively engage in normative economic research and policy advocacy:

1. **Brookings Institution**: A nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, D.C., that conducts in-depth research and provides innovative solutions to the nation's and world's economic and social challenges. Brookings Institution

2. **Cato Institute**: A libertarian think tank that conducts research on a wide [range](../r/range.md) of policy issues and advocates for policies based on the principles of individual liberty, [limited government](../l/limited_government.md), free markets, and peace. Cato Institute

3. **Economic Policy Institute**: A nonprofit think tank that focuses on issues affecting low- and middle-[income](../i/income.md) workers and advocates for economic policies that improve their [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). Economic Policy Institute

4. **Heritage Foundation**: A conservative think tank that promotes conservative public policies based on [free enterprise](../f/free_enterprise.md), [limited government](../l/limited_government.md), individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense. Heritage Foundation

### Conclusion

Normative [economics](../e/economics.md) is a vital aspect of economic theory and practice that deals with the 'oughts' of [economic life](../e/economic_life.md). While it is inherently subjective and [value](../v/value.md)-laden, it provides essential [guidance](../g/guidance.md) for policymakers and society in making ethical and informed economic decisions. By addressing normative questions, economists and policymakers can ensure that economic systems and policies not only function efficiently but also align with societal values and ethical considerations.
