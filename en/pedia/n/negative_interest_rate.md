# Negative Interest Rate

## Introduction

A negative [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is an unusual [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tool used by central banks to combat economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md) and deflationary trends. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are negative, it essentially means that banks and financial institutions are charged for holding [excess reserves](../e/excess_reserves.md) rather than earning [interest](../i/interest.md) on them. Instead of earning a [return](../r/return.md) on deposits, depositors must pay to keep their [money](../m/money.md) in the [bank](../b/bank.md). This concept contradicts traditional financial principles, where saving is rewarded with positive [interest](../i/interest.md) to grow [capital](../c/capital.md) over time.

## Why Implement Negative Interest Rates?

Negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are typically implemented in dire economic situations where conventional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tools aren't enough. Some of the main reasons for adopting negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates include:

### Combatting Deflation

[Deflation](../d/deflation.md) is a scenario where the general price levels of goods and services decrease over time. While this might sound beneficial for consumers initially, persistent [deflation](../d/deflation.md) can lead to reduced consumer spending, as people anticipate even lower prices in the future. This reduction in spending can stunt [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and lead to a vicious cycle of further [deflation](../d/deflation.md). By setting negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, central banks aim to discourage saving and incentivize spending and investment, thereby increasing [demand](../d/demand.md) and buoying prices.

### Stimulating Economic Growth

In periods of economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md), encouraging borrowing and spending is critical to reinvigorating the [economy](../e/economy.md). Negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates make borrowing cheaper for consumers and businesses, which can help stimulate economic activities such as investment, consumption, and hiring. When traditional tools like lowering positive [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) reach their limits, negative rates serve as an additional lever to reboot [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

### Encouraging Bank Lending

Banks that [hold](../h/hold.md) [excess reserves](../e/excess_reserves.md) with the central [bank](../b/bank.md) at negative rates are effectively penalized for [hoarding](../h/hoarding.md) [money](../m/money.md) instead of lending it out. This should, theoretically, encourage banks to increase their lending activities to businesses and consumers, thus facilitating more economic activity and growth.

## Historical Examples

### European Central Bank (ECB)

The European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) was one of the first major central banks to adopt negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. In June 2014, the ECB implemented a negative [deposit](../d/deposit.md) rate of -0.10%. The goal was to address low [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and sluggish [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) in the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md). Over time, the ECB further reduced its [deposit](../d/deposit.md) rate, reaching -0.50% by September 2019.


### Bank of Japan (BoJ)

Japan has experienced long-term economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md) and [deflation](../d/deflation.md), partly due to demographic challenges and structural economic issues. In January 2016, the [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Japan adopted a negative [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) strategy, setting the rate at -0.10%. The aim was to maintain stability while attempting to stimulate economic activity and counteract the impacts of [deflation](../d/deflation.md).


### Swiss National Bank (SNB)

The Swiss [National Bank](../n/national_bank.md) introduced negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates in December 2014, largely to counteract the strong appreciation of the Swiss Franc, which was harming the [export](../e/export.md)-dependent [economy](../e/economy.md). The SNB set its policy rate to -0.75%, intending to reduce the attractiveness of the Swiss Franc and maintain economic stability.


## Economic Mechanisms and Impacts

### Impact on Consumers

The direct impact of negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on consumers is primarily seen in their [bank](../b/bank.md) savings accounts. Instead of earning [interest](../i/interest.md) on their deposits, consumers may face charges for holding their [money](../m/money.md) in the [bank](../b/bank.md), although this is less frequent for small retail deposits. This can drive people to shift their [money](../m/money.md) into other investments like [stocks](../s/stock.md), [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), or even consumption, contributing to an economic [uptick](../u/uptick.md).

### Impact on Banks

Negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can squeeze the profitability of banks. Banks typically earn a [margin](../m/margin.md) by lending at higher rates than the rates at which they borrow or accept deposits. When central banks impose negative rates, this [margin](../m/margin.md) compresses, challenging the traditional banking model. Some banks may pass on the cost to consumers, while others could seek alternative [income](../i/income.md) sources or cut operational costs.

### Impact on Businesses

Businesses can benefit from negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates through cheaper borrowing costs. This can facilitate expansions, research and development, new hiring, and other investments. Lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can also make previously marginal projects financially viable. However, there can be negative effects too, such as when pension funds and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies [offering](../o/offering.md) retirement products struggle to meet promised returns, potentially jeopardizing future retirement incomes.

### Impact on Financial Markets

Negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can profoundly affect [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Lower [bond](../b/bond.md) yields can drive investors into riskier assets like [stocks](../s/stock.md), seeking higher returns. This can inflate [asset](../a/asset.md) prices and create speculative [bubbles](../b/bubble.md). However, it may also increase [volatility](../v/volatility.md) as traditional [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) mechanisms become distorted. Forex markets can also be impacted, as negative rates generally lead to [currency](../c/currency.md) [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), affecting international [trade](../t/trade.md) dynamics.

## Criticisms and Risks

### Savings and Pensions

One of the major criticisms of negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates is their impact on savers and pension funds. Negative rates erode the [value](../v/value.md) of savings and disrupt the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of pension funds, which depend on [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) to meet future [obligations](../o/obligation.md). For individuals and institutions relying on [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) or pension plans, this can pose significant challenges.

### Financial Stability

Sustained periods of negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can pose risks to financial stability. By driving speculative investments and reducing the profitability of banks, the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) can become more vulnerable to shocks. Low margins may push banks to take on higher risks in lending, potentially leading to future financial crises.

### Effectiveness

There is also debate about the effectiveness of negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Some argue that they could have diminishing returns by distorting economic signals and encouraging excessive [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking. Empirical studies on the long-term impacts of negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are still inconclusive, given their relatively recent adoption.

## The Future of Negative Interest Rates

As economic landscapes continue evolving, the use and prevalence of negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates [will](../w/will.md) likely remain a topic of debate. With [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) navigating increasingly complex global challenges, from pandemics to geopolitical tensions and climate change, central banks may rely more on unconventional tools, including negative rates, to maintain economic stability.

The future [will](../w/will.md) reveal more about the practical limits, advantages, and disadvantages of negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, contributing to the ongoing evolution of global financial systems and [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).

## Conclusion

Negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are a radical [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tool aimed at combating [deflation](../d/deflation.md) and stimulating [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). While implemented with specific goals in mind, they present several risks and uncertainties. The effectiveness and long-term impacts of negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates continue to be subjects of extensive study and debate in the economic and financial community.
