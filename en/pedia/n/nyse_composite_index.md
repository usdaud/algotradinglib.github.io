# NYSE Composite Index

The NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) is a stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) that tracks the performance of all common [stocks](../s/stock.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) on the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE). It is considered one of the broadest and most inclusive indexes in the U.S. [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, representing the performance of a diverse array of industries and sectors that make up the NYSE. The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is calculated using a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) methodology, meaning larger companies have a greater influence on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s performance than smaller ones.

## Introduction
The NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) includes over 1,900 [stocks](../s/stock.md), including both U.S. and international companies. It is a vital [indicator](../i/indicator.md) for gauging the overall health of the equities traded on the NYSE. With its creation dating back to the early 1960s, this [index](../i/index_instrument.md) offers a long-term perspective on [market](../m/market.md) trends and serves as a comprehensive [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for investors and analysts.

## Calculation Methodology
The NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) uses a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) calculation, making it sensitive to the fluctuations in the [market](../m/market.md) values of the larger companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the NYSE. Unlike price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) gives proportionately more weight to companies with larger [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations.

### Formula
The formula for the NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) is as follows:

\[ \text{Index Level} = \left( \frac{\sum(\text{[Market](../m/market.md) Cap of All Components})}{\text{Divisor}} \right) \]

### Market Cap Calculation
- **[Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)**: It is calculated as the share price multiplied by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) for each company.
- **Divisor**: A proprietary figure that adjusts for stock splits, spinoffs, and other corporate actions to maintain [index](../i/index_instrument.md) continuity.

## Components

- Information Technology

The components are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain representative of the broader [market](../m/market.md).
