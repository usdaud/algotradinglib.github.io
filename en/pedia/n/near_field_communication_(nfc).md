# Near Field Communication (NFC)

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually portable like a smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within close proximity, typically within a few centimeters. NFC technology has grown significantly since its inception and is now used in various applications ranging from contactless payments to data [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and access control.

## History and Development
NFC technology is derived from radio-frequency identification (RFID) and was first standardized in 2004. It builds upon the inherent principles of RFID but provides mutual communication, while RFID typically involves unidirectional communication. NFC's development was substantially driven by the collaboration between major tech companies like Sony, Nokia, and Philips.

## How NFC Works
NFC operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and allows for data [exchange](../e/exchange.md) at rates ranging from 106 Kbps to 424 Kbps. Its working [range](../r/range.md) is typically about 4 centimeters, though it can reach up to 10 centimeters under optimal conditions. Unlike Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, NFC requires no manual pairing, which simplifies its use enormously.

NFC interactions are classified into two types:
1. **Passive Communication [Mode](../m/mode.md)**: One device (the initiator) generates a radio frequency field, and the second device (the target) responds using [load](../l/load.md) modulation.
2. **Active Communication [Mode](../m/mode.md)**: Both devices generate their own radio frequency fields during communication.

The communication can involve both read-write operations and peer-to-peer exchanges.

## NFC Standards
NFC is governed by several standards:
1. **ISO/IEC 18092 / ECMA-340** (Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol-1, NFCIP-1)
2. **ISO/IEC 21481 / ECMA-352** (Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol-2, NFCIP-2)
3. **ISO/IEC 14443** (Proximity Cards, used also for contactless smart cards)
4. **FeliCa** (by Sony [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), widely used in Japan)

## Use Cases and Applications

### Contactless Payments
One of the most significant applications of NFC is in contactless payments. Services like Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and Samsung Pay [leverage](../l/leverage.md) NFC technology to facilitate quick and secure transactions. By simply bringing their smartphones next to a contactless [payment](../p/payment.md) terminal, users can complete transactions without the need for physical cards. These systems often use a secure element (SE) or host card emulation (HCE) for secure transactions.

### Ticketing and Access Control
NFC is widely used in ticketing systems for public transportation, concerts, and events. NFC-enabled cards or smartphones can store ticket information, allowing users to tap them against a reader to [gain](../g/gain.md) access. This application extends to access control in buildings, hotels, and private premises, providing a convenient and secure way to manage entry.

### Data Exchange
NFC supports quick data [exchange](../e/exchange.md) between devices. This facilitates sharing contacts, photos, videos, files, or even pairing Bluetooth devices simply by bringing them close together. Android Beam, though deprecated in recent versions of Android, was a popular method for such exchanges.

### Healthcare and Identification
In healthcare, NFC is used for patient identification and medical record management. NFC-enabled wristbands or cards can store patient information, ensuring accurate and immediate access to medical histories. Similarly, NFC technology is used in identification badges for various purposes like employee ID, membership cards, etc.

### Internet of Things (IoT)
NFC plays a significant role in the Internet of Things (IoT) by providing a simple and secure way to connect and interact with smart objects. For instance, [home](../h/home.md) automation systems use NFC for device pairing and control.

## Security Aspects
[Security](../s/security.md) is a primary concern in NFC applications, especially for contactless payments and data transfers. The NFC standards incorporate [multiple](../m/multiple.md) layers of [security](../s/security.md) measures:
1. **Encryption**: Encrypting the data being transmitted.
2. **Mutual Authentication**: Verifying both the initiator and the target devices.
3. **Secure Element (SE)**: A dedicated chip embedded in the device for storing sensitive information.
4. **Host Card Emulation (HCE)**: Emulates a secure element in software, providing similar [security](../s/security.md) levels.

Despite these measures, NFC is susceptible to threats like eavesdropping, data modification, and relay attacks. Hence, continuous advancements and enhancements in [security](../s/security.md) protocols are essential.

## NFC vs. Other Technologies
NFC often competes with or complements other communication technologies like RFID, Bluetooth, and QR codes.

- **RFID**: Both RFID and NFC operate on similar principles, but NFC provides bidirectional communication and has a shorter [range](../r/range.md), making it more suitable for secure transactions.
- **Bluetooth**: Bluetooth offers longer [range](../r/range.md) and higher data transfer rates, but requires manual pairing, which NFC does not. NFC is often used to initiate Bluetooth pairing.
- **QR Codes**: QR codes are a cost-effective alternative for data sharing and transactions but require camera operation and do not [offer](../o/offer.md) the same level of [security](../s/security.md) or user convenience as NFC.

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
1. **Ease of Use**: No manual pairing required.
2. **Speed**: Faster set-up and [transaction](../t/transaction.md) times.
3. **Versatility**: Can be used in various applications like payments, ticketing, data [exchange](../e/exchange.md), etc.
4. **[Security](../s/security.md)**: Built-in [security](../s/security.md) features like encryption and mutual authentication.

### Limitations
1. **[Range](../r/range.md)**: Limited to a few centimeters.
2. **Interoperability**: Limited support among all devices.
3. **Battery Dependency**: Active [mode](../m/mode.md) requires device power.

## Future of NFC
The future of NFC is promising, with continuous advancements expected in miniaturization, [security](../s/security.md) protocols, and integration with other technologies. With the rise of smart cities and IoT, NFC's role in providing seamless and secure interactions [will](../w/will.md) likely expand. Enhanced interoperability and universal acceptance [will](../w/will.md) further [leverage](../l/leverage.md) its potential in various industries, providing more convenient and secure user experiences.
