# Near Term

In [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, the term "near term" refers to the short period in the immediate future. This timeframe is commonly used by investors, traders, and analysts to predict or describe events, trends, movements, and other factors influencing the prices of assets or [market](../m/market.md) behavior over the next few days, weeks, or possibly months. Here's a detailed overview of this concept, particularly focusing on its implications in trading, [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).

## Defining Near Term

The "near term" is not precisely quantified since it could vary depending on the context or the specific [market](../m/market.md) participants' strategies. Generally, it spans from a few days to a few months. This period contrasts with "long term," which could extend to years. Near-term considerations are particularly crucial for traders who rely on short-term price movements to generate returns.

## Near Term in Equity Markets

### Price Movements

In [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, near-term price movements can be influenced by various factors, including [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, economic data releases, geopolitical events, or company-specific news. Traders often focus on such short-term influences to execute trades that [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on expected price fluctuations.

### Earnings Season

One of the critical near-term events in [equity](../e/equity.md) markets is the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) season, which occurs four times a year when publicly traded companies release their [quarterly earnings reports](../q/quarterly_earnings_reports.md). These reports can cause significant stock price movements based on how the reported [earnings](../e/earnings.md) compare to [market](../m/market.md) expectations.

### Trading Strategies

Traders use numerous strategies to exploit near-term opportunities, including:

- **[Swing Trading](../s/swing_trading.md):** Involves holding [stocks](../s/stock.md) for several days or weeks to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on expected upward or downward swings in prices.
- **[Day Trading](../d/day_trading.md):** Entails buying and selling [stocks](../s/stock.md) within a single trading day to take advantage of small price movements.
- **[Scalping](../s/scalping.md):** A more granular form of [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) aiming to [profit](../p/profit.md) from minor price [gaps](../g/gap.md) created by [order](../o/order.md) flows.

## Near Term in Fixed Income Markets

### Interest Rate Expectations

In fixed-[income](../i/income.md) markets, near-term considerations often involve expectations about [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements. Central [bank](../b/bank.md) policy decisions, [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) data are crucial inputs for these expectations. Traders might adjust their portfolios based on anticipated near-term changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Bond Yields

Short-term [bond](../b/bond.md) yields, such as those on Treasury bills, are often responsive to near-term [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and economic data. These instruments are used by investors to park funds when anticipating near-term [market](../m/market.md) turbulence.

## Near Term in Cryptocurrency Markets

### Volatility

Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), making near-term price movements particularly pronounced. Traders in these markets may focus intensely on [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) to inform their [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) decisions.

### News Sensitivity

Cryptocurrencies often react sharply to news. Anything from regulatory announcements, technological advancements, or even [social media](../s/social_media.md) events can cause significant near-term price movements.

## Algorithmic Trading and Near Term

### Algorithmic Models

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) models, particularly High-Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithms, benefit greatly from exploiting near-term [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies. These models often incorporate:

- **Real-time Data:** To react instantly to [market](../m/market.md) changes.
- **[Predictive Analytics](../p/predictive_analytics.md):** To forecast near-term movements based on historical patterns and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md).
- **[Execution Algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md):** To optimize [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) by minimizing [market](../m/market.md) impact and [slippage](../s/slippage.md).

### Machine Learning and AI

[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and AI tools can be applied to predict near-term [market](../m/market.md) movements. These technologies might analyze vast datasets, including [market](../m/market.md) prices, trading volumes, news articles, and [social media sentiment](../s/social_media_sentiment.md), to generate near-term [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).

### Backtesting

Near-term [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) often undergo rigorous [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) to evaluate their efficacy. This involves running the strategy on historical data to see how it would have performed in different [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Near Term Risk Management

### Volatility Control

Managing near-term risks is crucial for traders and investors. Near-term [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can pose challenges, and various [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools and techniques can be employed, such as:

- **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md):** To limit potential losses by automatically selling a [security](../s/security.md) when it reaches a certain price.
- **Hedging:** Using [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), or other [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to protect against unfavorable price movements.

### Liquidity Considerations

Near-term traders need to ensure sufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to enter and exit positions quickly. Highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) instruments are preferred for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) since they allow traders to execute large orders with minimal price impact.

## Conclusion

The concept of the near term is pivotal in [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, encompassing various strategies, [risk management techniques](../r/risk_management_techniques.md), and the use of advanced algorithms. It demands a detailed understanding of [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) and the ability to quickly process and react to incoming information. Due to its focus on immediate or short-term future, it contrasts with long-term investment perspectives, requiring a different skill set and approach.
