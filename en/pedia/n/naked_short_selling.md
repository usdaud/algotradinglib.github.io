# Naked Short Selling

Naked short selling is the practice of selling shares short without first borrowing or locating the shares. Unlike covered short selling, the seller may not be able to deliver shares at settlement, which can create fails to deliver.

## How it differs from covered shorting
- Covered shorting requires a locate or borrow before the sale.
- Naked shorting skips the borrow step.
- Naked shorting increases settlement risk.

## Regulatory context
In many markets, rules such as Regulation SHO restrict or prohibit naked short selling and impose close out requirements for fails. Some exemptions may exist for market makers under specific conditions.

## Example
A trader sells short 50,000 shares in a thin stock without a borrow. At settlement, shares are unavailable, creating a fail to deliver and potential regulatory action.

## Risks and controversies
Critics argue that naked short selling can distort prices, while proponents note it can add liquidity in some cases. Enforcement and transparency vary by jurisdiction.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Naked Short Selling and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Naked Short Selling as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Naked Short Selling, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Naked Short Selling. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Naked Short Selling alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
