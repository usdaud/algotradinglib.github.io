# Not-Held Order

A not-[held order](../h/held_order.md) is an instruction that gives the [broker](../b/broker.md) or the [trader](../t/trader.md) the discretion to buy or sell a specified [security](../s/security.md) at the best price they can find over a given period. Unlike [market](../m/market.md) orders or limit orders, which must be executed at the best immediate price or a specified price, respectively, not-held orders [offer](../o/offer.md) the [broker](../b/broker.md) latitude in deciding when and how to execute the [order](../o/order.md) to achieve the best possible outcome for the client.

## Key Characteristics

### Discretionary Execution
The defining feature of a not-[held order](../h/held_order.md) is the discretionary power it grants to the [broker](../b/broker.md). This discretion means the [broker](../b/broker.md) doesn't have to fill the [order](../o/order.md) immediately. Instead, the [broker](../b/broker.md) can wait for the [market](../m/market.md) to reach more favorable conditions. For instance, if the [broker](../b/broker.md) senses that a stock's price may drop, they can [hold](../h/hold.md) off on executing the buy [order](../o/order.md) until they believe the price has bottomed out.

### Price Optimization
Because brokers are not bound to execute a not-[held order](../h/held_order.md) immediately, they can take advantage of price movements to achieve better prices. For instance, they might buy in smaller chunks over the course of the day to avoid moving the [market price](../m/market_price.md) or to catch the stock at various low points throughout the day.

### Client-Broker Trust
A not-[held order](../h/held_order.md) requires a high degree of [trust](../t/trust.md) between the client and [broker](../b/broker.md). The client must [trust](../t/trust.md) the [broker](../b/broker.md)'s expertise and [judgment](../j/judgment.md) in timing and executing the [order](../o/order.md), as the [broker](../b/broker.md) is given significant latitude.

### Legal and Regulatory Framework
In the United States, the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md) and the [Investment Advisers Act of 1940](../i/investment_advisers_act_of_1940.md) set the framework for [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers and their fiduciary responsibilities. Not-held orders are subject to these regulations, and brokers must ensure they are acting in the best [interest](../i/interest.md) of their clients.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
1. **Flexibility**: Brokers can adjust their strategy in real-time to respond to [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
2. **Potential for Better Pricing**: By waiting for more favorable conditions, brokers might secure better prices for the client.
3. **Reduced [Market](../m/market.md) Impact**: By breaking large orders into smaller transactions, brokers can minimize the impact on the [market price](../m/market_price.md).

### Cons
1. **[Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: There's no guarantee the [broker](../b/broker.md) [will](../w/will.md) secure a better price, and [market](../m/market.md) conditions can shift unexpectedly.
2. **[Trust](../t/trust.md) Reliance**: The client must fully [trust](../t/trust.md) the [broker](../b/broker.md)'s [judgment](../j/judgment.md) and integrity, which can be challenging if the [broker](../b/broker.md)'s past performance is unconvincing.
3. **Potential Delays**: [Execution](../e/execution.md) can be delayed if the [broker](../b/broker.md) is waiting for better conditions.

## Comparison with Other Orders

### Market Orders
[Market](../m/market.md) orders are executed immediately at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). They are the simplest type of [order](../o/order.md), but they [offer](../o/offer.md) no flexibility in terms of timing and may not secure the best possible price during periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Limit Orders
Limit orders allow clients to specify a maximum purchase price or minimum selling price. These orders ensure that the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) [will](../w/will.md) only occur at the set price or better, but they do not guarantee the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) be filled.

### Stop Orders
Stop orders become [market](../m/market.md) or limit orders once a specified price is reached. They are used to mitigate losses or lock in gains but [offer](../o/offer.md) no discretion in terms of when the [order](../o/order.md) is executed once the trigger price is met.

## Use Cases

### Institutional Investors
Institutional investors, such as mutual funds or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, often use not-held orders to manage large transactions. These large orders can significantly impact stock prices if executed all at once, so brokers use discretion in executing these orders to minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact.

### Volatile Markets
In highly volatile markets, timing can be everything. A [broker](../b/broker.md) with the discretion to pause and wait for prices to stabilize or move favorably can potentially secure a better outcome for the client.

### Illiquid Securities
For securities that are not traded frequently, finding the right time to execute an [order](../o/order.md) can be crucial. A not-[held order](../h/held_order.md) allows the [broker](../b/broker.md) to wait for sufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), thereby avoiding a scenario where a large [order](../o/order.md) causes significant price swings.

## Technology and Algorithms

With advancements in technology, brokers now often use algorithms to execute not-held orders. These algorithms can analyze vast amounts of [market](../m/market.md) data to determine the optimal timing and manner of [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md). This is particularly useful for high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, which rely on algorithms to make rapid trading decisions.

### Algorithmic Trading Strategies
1. **VWAP ([Volume](../v/volume.md)-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price)**: This strategy aims to execute orders in proportion to the trading [volume](../v/volume.md), minimizing [market](../m/market.md) impact.
2. **TWAP (Time-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price)**: Orders are broken into smaller parts and executed evenly over a specified time period.
3. **Implementation [Shortfall](../s/shortfall.md)**: This strategy focuses on minimizing the cost of delayed [execution](../e/execution.md) by dynamically adjusting the [execution](../e/execution.md) rate.

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
[Machine learning algorithms](../m/machine_learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) analyze historical trading data and model potential [market](../m/market.md) scenarios to make more informed decisions regarding the [execution](../e/execution.md) of not-held orders. For example, [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) can predict short-term price movements, thereby aiding brokers in executing orders at the most advantageous times.

## Risks and Mitigation

### Market Risk
[Market](../m/market.md) conditions can change rapidly, and the [broker](../b/broker.md)'s [judgment](../j/judgment.md) may not always be correct. Even the best brokers can misinterpret [market](../m/market.md) signals, leading to suboptimal [execution](../e/execution.md).

#### Mitigation
Diversified [execution](../e/execution.md) strategies and real-time [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) can help brokers make more informed decisions. Regular reviews and audits of past performance can identify areas for improvement.

### Operational Risk
Errors in [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), whether due to human error or technological failures, can lead to financial losses and damage to client relationships.

#### Mitigation
Operational risks can be mitigated by implementing [robust](../r/robust.md) systems for [order management](../o/order_management_in_trading.md), regular training for brokers, and using well-tested algorithms.

### Regulatory Risk
Brokers must comply with regulatory requirements, including best [execution](../e/execution.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in [order](../o/order.md) handling. Failure to meet these standards can lead to fines and legal actions.

#### Mitigation
Regular compliance training, internal audits, and leveraging compliance software can help brokers stay within regulatory guidelines.

## Conclusion

Not-held orders provide a flexible and potentially beneficial alternative to standard [market](../m/market.md) and limit orders, particularly in complex or volatile trading environments. By allowing brokers to use their [judgment](../j/judgment.md) and expertise to execute trades at the most opportune times, clients can often achieve better pricing and reduced [market](../m/market.md) impact. However, this flexibility comes with its own set of risks and requires a high degree of [trust](../t/trust.md) between the client and [broker](../b/broker.md). Advancements in technology, especially in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), have further enhanced the effectiveness of not-held orders by enabling more sophisticated decision-making processes. Therefore, when used appropriately, not-held orders can be a powerful tool in a [trader](../t/trader.md)'s arsenal, delivering significant advantages in achieving optimal trading outcomes.
