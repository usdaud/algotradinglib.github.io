# Numeraire

Numeraire (NMR) is a unique cryptocurrency created by Numerai, a [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) that uses [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) (AI) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) to make trading decisions. It acts as both a staking mechanism and an incentive structure for data scientists who contribute [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) to Numerai’s platform. The term "numeraire" in [economics](../e/economics.md) refers to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) or standard by which [value](../v/value.md) is measured. Numerai, the company, applies the concept in a new way to the field of [data science](../d/data_science_in_trading.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md).

## Overview of Numerai

Numerai is a platform that leverages [data science](../d/data_science_in_trading.md) to make [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) predictions. Founded by Richard Craib in 2015, Numerai is headquartered in San Francisco. The company invites data scientists from around the world to participate in its tournaments, where they develop [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) using anonymized data provided by Numerai. The models are then aggregated to form a meta-model, which Numerai uses to [trade](../t/trade.md) in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

Numerai aims to build a more resilient and predictive model by crowdsourcing the development of predictive algorithms. Data scientists compete in tournaments, where the winners are rewarded with NMR tokens. The platform operates under a principle of radical openness, sharing its financial data openly with participants while ensuring the data is anonymized to protect its proprietary nature.

## How Numeraire Works

NMR acts as a staking token within the Numerai ecosystem. Data scientists are required to stake NMR tokens on their models to participate in the tournaments. The amount of NMR staked reflects the confidence data scientists have in their models. If the model performs well, the data scientist earns additional NMR tokens as a reward. Conversely, if the model performs poorly, the staked tokens are burned, reducing the [supply](../s/supply.md) of NMR.

This staking mechanism serves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) purposes:
- **Incentive Alignment**: By requiring data scientists to stake NMR, Numerai ensures that participants are motivated to create high-quality, accurate models.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: The burning of poorly staked tokens helps weed out ineffective models, ensuring that Numerai’s [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) are based on [robust](../r/robust.md) predictions.
- **Token [Demand](../d/demand.md)**: The staking process creates a continuous [demand](../d/demand.md) for NMR tokens, providing stability and [value](../v/value.md) to the cryptocurrency.

## Tokenomics

As of the most recent updates, the maximum [supply](../s/supply.md) of NMR is capped at 11 million tokens. The controlled [supply](../s/supply.md) mechanism ensures that NMR remains scarce, potentially increasing its [value](../v/value.md) over time as [demand](../d/demand.md) grows. Here are some key features of NMR's tokenomics:

1. **Reward [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: NMR tokens are distributed as rewards to high-performing data scientists within the tournament.
2. **Burn Mechanism**: Poorly performing models result in the burning of the staked NMR tokens, effectively reducing the circulating [supply](../s/supply.md).
3. **ERC-20 Standard**: NMR operates on the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and complies with the ERC-20 standard, making it interoperable with various wallets and exchanges.
4. **[Utility](../u/utility.md)**: The primary [utility](../u/utility.md) of NMR is its use within the Numerai platform for staking and earning rewards. However, it can also be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Participation in Numerai’s Tournament

Participation in Numerai's tournament involves several steps:
1. **Data Download**: Data scientists download the anonymized datasets provided by Numerai. These datasets contain historical [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) data devoid of any proprietary information.
2. **Model Development**: Participants develop [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) based on the downloaded data using various [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) techniques.
3. **Submission**: [Predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) are submitted to Numerai's platform.
4. **Staking NMR**: To participate in the tournament, data scientists must stake a certain amount of NMR on their models.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Numerai evaluates the models based on their predictive accuracy over a period of time.
6. **Reward or Burn**: Based on the performance, NMR tokens are either awarded or burned.

## Advantages of Numeraire

Numerai and its cryptocurrency, NMR, [offer](../o/offer.md) several advantages:
- **Decentralized Wisdom**: By aggregating predictions from a diverse group of data scientists, Numerai aims to create a more accurate and resilient meta-model.
- **Incentive Alignment**: The staking and reward mechanism aligns incentives, ensuring that participants are motivated to develop high-quality models.
- **[Open](../o/open.md) Participation**: Data scientists from around the world can participate, democratizing access to [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and tapping into a global pool of talent.
- **Innovative Approach**: Numerai's use of AI and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) in [finance](../f/finance.md) represents a forward-thinking approach to trading and investment.

## Challenges and Limitations

Despite its innovative approach, Numerai and NMR face several challenges:
- **Model Reliability**: The effectiveness of Numerai's [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) depends on the quality and reliability of the [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) submitted by participants.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, which can affect the [value](../v/value.md) of NMR and impact participants' decisions to stake tokens.
- **Regulatory [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and decentralized [finance](../f/finance.md) (DeFi) is still evolving, which may pose risks for Numerai and its participants.

## Conclusion

Numeraire (NMR) is a groundbreaking cryptocurrency that underpins the Numerai platform. By leveraging the collective intelligence of data scientists and employing a staking mechanism to ensure high-quality predictions, Numerai aims to revolutionize the field of [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md). While challenges exist, the innovative approach and strong incentive structure provide a compelling case for the potential of NMR and Numerai to make a significant impact on [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
