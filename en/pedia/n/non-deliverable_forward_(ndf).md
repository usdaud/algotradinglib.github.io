# Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF)

A Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) is a financial [derivative](../d/derivative.md), specifically a [forward contract](../f/forward_contract.md), that involves a [currency](../c/currency.md) pair that includes at least one non-convertible [currency](../c/currency.md), trading in emerging markets or other markets where [currency](../c/currency.md) controls restrict the use or availability of the [currency](../c/currency.md). This [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) allows parties to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) or speculate on the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) between two currencies, where one or both of the currencies cannot be freely exchanged or delivered. The NDF is settled in a convertible [currency](../c/currency.md), most commonly U.S. Dollars (USD). This guide [will](../w/will.md) explore NDFs in depth, their characteristics, mechanisms, benefits, risks, and their use in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Characteristics of NDFs

### Contract Terms

NDF contracts have well-defined terms, including:
- **Notional Amount**: The amount in the non-convertible [currency](../c/currency.md) that is under consideration in the contract.
- **Settlement Date**: The future date upon which the contract [will](../w/will.md) be settled.
- **Fixing Date**: The date before the settlement when the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) between the two currencies is determined.
- **[Forward Rate](../f/forward_rate.md)**: The agreed-upon [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) for the non-convertible [currency](../c/currency.md) at the time of contract initiation.

### Settlement Mechanism

Unlike traditional [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) that involve the delivery of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), NDFs are settled in cash. On the fixing date, the prevailing [spot rate](../s/spot_rate.md) for the [currency](../c/currency.md) pair is compared to the pre-agreed [forward rate](../f/forward_rate.md). The difference between the two rates is used to compute the [payment](../p/payment.md) in the convertible [currency](../c/currency.md) (typically USD). 

- **Cash Settlement**: The payoff is based on the notional amount and the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) difference. If the fixing rate is less favorable than the agreed [forward rate](../f/forward_rate.md) for the buyer, the seller compensates the buyer, and vice versa.

### Typical Uses of NDFs

- **Hedging**: Companies, especially those with international operations, use NDFs to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) in markets where currencies cannot be freely exchanged. For example, a company worried about the [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) of a non-convertible [currency](../c/currency.md) in which it has significant receivables might use an NDF to lock in a future [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md).
- **[Speculation](../s/speculation.md)**: Traders and investors use NDFs to speculate on future movements in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates. By entering into these contracts, they can [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to [currency](../c/currency.md) movements without needing to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) the actual [currency](../c/currency.md).

## Benefits of NDFs

- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: NDFs provide a vehicle for managing exposure to currencies that might be subject to significant fluctuations or are restricted by [capital](../c/capital.md) controls.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Accessibility**: Enables participation in markets that would otherwise be inaccessible due to [currency](../c/currency.md) controls.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: While the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) non-convertible [currency](../c/currency.md) markets may be illiquid, the NDF [market](../m/market.md) generally offers better [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), particularly for major emerging [market](../m/market.md) currencies.
- **Settlement Simplicity**: Cash settlement simplifies operational [logistics](../l/logistics.md), as there is no need to [handle](../h/handle.md) or transfer the non-convertible [currency](../c/currency.md).

## Risks Associated with NDFs

- **[Counterparty Risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md)**: As with all over-the-counter (OTC) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), NDFs entail [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) â€“ the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the other party in the contract may [default](../d/default.md).
- **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**: The primary [risk](../r/risk.md) is [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) due to changes in the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) of the involved currencies.
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Although generally more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) non-convertible [currency](../c/currency.md), NDF markets can sometimes be thin, leading to [execution](../e/execution.md) risks.
- **[Regulatory Risk](../r/regulatory_risk.md)**: Changes in policies by governments, such as tightening [capital](../c/capital.md) controls, can affect the viability and pricing of NDFs.

## Underlying Currencies in NDF Markets

NDFs are commonly used for currencies that are subject to [capital](../c/capital.md) controls and are not fully convertible on the international markets. Some of the widely traded NDF currencies include:
- Chinese Yuan (CNY)
- Indian Rupee (INR)
- Brazilian Real (BRL)
- Russian Ruble (RUB)
- Korean Won (KRW)

## Example of an NDF Transaction

To clarify the concept, consider an example involving an NDF on the Indian Rupee (INR) against the US Dollar (USD).

- **Party A** is a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) with substantial receivables in INR.
- **Party B** is a financial institution willing to engage in an NDF.
- They agree on an NDF with a notional amount of INR 10,000,000.
- The agreed [forward rate](../f/forward_rate.md) is 75 INR/USD.
- The fixing date is one day before the settlement date, and the settlement date is 3 months from the contract date.

On the fixing date:
- The actual [spot rate](../s/spot_rate.md) is found to be 77 INR/USD.
- Since the INR has depreciated against the USD (77 is higher than 75), Party A [will](../w/will.md) benefit, as they would have received fewer USD had they waited to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) at the [spot rate](../s/spot_rate.md).
- The difference is 77 - 75 = 2 INR per USD.
- The settlement amount in USD is (2 INR/USD * 10,000,000 INR) / 77 INR/USD = $259,740.26.

Party B [will](../w/will.md) pay Party A $259,740.26 on the settlement date.

## Importance and Impact on Financial Markets

NDFs play a crucial role in global [finance](../f/finance.md) by allowing entities to manage [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) in markets with restricted currencies. They contribute to global financial stability by providing mechanisms to mitigate potential [currency](../c/currency.md)-related losses for corporations and investors. Additionally, NDF markets [offer](../o/offer.md) insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and expectations for restricted currencies, which can be valuable for policy-makers and economists.

### Market Participants

Primary participants in the NDF [market](../m/market.md) include:
- **Corporate Treasuries**: Enterprises involved in international [trade](../t/trade.md) use NDFs to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **[Asset](../a/asset.md) Managers and [Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds**: Leveraging NDFs for speculative purposes to benefit from [currency](../c/currency.md) movements.
- **Banks and Financial Institutions**: Acting as [market](../m/market.md) makers, providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) for trading NDFs.

## Future of NDFs

The [trend](../t/trend.md) of global [economic integration](../e/economic_integration.md) and the continued emergence of new markets suggest that NDFs [will](../w/will.md) remain relevant and may even grow in importance. Advances in technology, particularly in the realms of fintech and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), are likely to increase the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and accessibility of NDF markets, potentially democratizing participation and improving [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Technological Impact: Algorithmic Trading and Fintech

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), powered by advances in [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) and [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), is increasingly applied in the NDF markets. These technologies can analyze large datasets to identify trends and execute trades with precision, enhancing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and reducing [spreads](../s/spreads.md). Fintech companies are also innovating in areas like [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and regulatory compliance, making it easier for smaller entities to participate in the NDF [market](../m/market.md).
