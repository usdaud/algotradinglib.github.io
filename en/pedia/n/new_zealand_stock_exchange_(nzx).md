# New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX)

The New Zealand Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NZX) is the premier securities [market](../m/market.md) in New Zealand, [offering](../o/offering.md) a platform for listing and trading a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial instruments, including equities, [debt](../d/debt.md) securities, funds, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). As a primary [exchange](../e/exchange.md), NZX plays a critical role in the New Zealand [economy](../e/economy.md) by providing [capital](../c/capital.md) [market](../m/market.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), facilitating corporate [financing](../f/financing.md), and ensuring a transparent and fair [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

## Background and History

The NZX traces its origins back to the Gold Rush era of the 1860s, when informal stock markets began emerging in New Zealand’s major cities. Initially, it operated as a series of regional exchanges, but these were amalgamated into a single national [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in 1974. The modern entity, NZX Limited, was formally established in December 2002 under the New Zealand Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) Act. This act transitioned the organization from a mutual association to a for-[profit](../p/profit.md) company.
