# Neural Architecture Search

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an automated process for designing the architecture of [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md), aiming to find optimal structures for specific tasks without extensive manual tuning.

### Key Components
- **Search Space:** The set of possible network architectures to explore.
- **Search Algorithm:** Techniques such as [reinforcement learning](../r/reinforcement_learning.md), evolutionary algorithms, or gradient-based methods to navigate the search space.
- **Performance Estimation:** Methods to quickly estimate the performance of candidate architectures.
- **[Optimization](../o/optimization.md) Objective:** Balancing accuracy, [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), and resource usage.

### Applications
- **Custom Model Design:** Automatically designing models for specific tasks and datasets.
- **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) Improvements:** Finding architectures that reduce computational cost while maintaining performance.
- **Innovation:** Discovering novel architectures that may [outperform](../o/outperform.md) human-designed ones.
- **Hardware [Optimization](../o/optimization.md):** Tailoring model architectures for specific hardware constraints.

### Advantages
- Reduces human effort in designing complex architectures.
- Can discover innovative and highly efficient network designs.
- Potential for improved performance through automated exploration.

### Challenges
- High computational cost due to the vast search space.
- Difficulty in accurately predicting the performance of candidate architectures.
- Balancing [multiple](../m/multiple.md) objectives such as accuracy and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

### Future Outlook
Advancements in NAS are expected to make it more accessible and cost-effective, leading to widespread adoption in designing state-of-the-art models that are both innovative and resource-efficient.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Neural Architecture Search and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Neural Architecture Search as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Neural Architecture Search, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Neural Architecture Search. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Neural Architecture Search alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
