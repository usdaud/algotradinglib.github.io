A national [bank](../b/bank.md) is a financial institution that is chartered and regulated by a country's national government. In many countries, national banks play a critical role in implementing [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), controlling the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), and maintaining financial stability. They often serve as the foundation of the country's banking system, providing services to both the government and commercial banks.

### RegTech and SupTech

[RegTech](../r/regtech.md) (regulatory technology) and SupTech (supervisory technology) are technologies that help financial institutions comply with regulations and help national banks supervise the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) more effectively. Applications include:

- **Automated Reporting:** Technologies that automate the collection and submission of regulatory reports.
- **AI and Machine Learning:** Tools that enhance the monitoring of financial transactions and the identification of suspicious activities.

### Payment Systems

National banks are involved in modernizing [payment](../p/payment.md) systems to improve [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), reduce costs, and enhance [security](../s/security.md). Initiatives include:

- **Faster Payments:** Systems that enable instant or near-instant transfer of funds between [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts.
- **[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and [Distributed Ledger Technology](../d/distributed_ledger_technology.md) (DLT):** Technologies that improve the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [security](../s/security.md) of financial transactions.

## Conclusion

National banks are fundamental institutions in any country's [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), tasked with implementing [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), ensuring financial stability, issuing [currency](../c/currency.md), providing government banking services, and conducting economic research. With the advent of FinTech, national banks are adapting to new technologies and innovations to improve the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [security](../s/security.md) of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). Prominent examples of national banks include the Federal Reserve, European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md), [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Japan, and People's [Bank](../b/bank.md) of China, each playing a crucial role in their respective economies.
