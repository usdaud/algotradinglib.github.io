## Conclusion

National banks are fundamental institutions in any country's [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), tasked with implementing [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), ensuring financial stability, issuing [currency](../c/currency.md), providing government banking services, and conducting economic research. With the advent of FinTech, national banks are adapting to new technologies and innovations to improve the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [security](../s/security.md) of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). Prominent examples of national banks include the Federal Reserve, European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md), [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Japan, and People's [Bank](../b/bank.md) of China, each playing a crucial role in their respective economies.
