# Next Day Order

A next day order is an instruction that becomes active on the next trading session rather than immediately. It is used to place orders outside market hours for execution the following day.

## How it works
- The order is entered after market close or with a delayed activation.
- It becomes live at the next session open or a broker specified time.
- If not filled, its duration depends on the order type, such as day or GTC.

## Example
A trader places a next day limit order to buy at 95 after analyzing the market in the evening. The order becomes active the next morning.

## Practical notes
Next day orders can be affected by overnight gaps. Traders should reassess if new information changes the setup.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Next Day Order and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Next Day Order as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Next Day Order, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Next Day Order. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Next Day Order alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
