# Net Internal Rate of Return

The Net Internal [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (NIRR) is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project. It is the [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) that makes the net [present value](../p/present_value.md) (NPV) of all cash flows, both inflows and outflows, from an investment equal to zero. Unlike the simple Internal [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (IRR), which considers only the cash inflows, the NIRR also takes into account the initial and subsequent cash outflows, making it a more comprehensive measure for evaluating investment performance.

## Formula and Calculation

The formula for calculating the NIRR is similar to that of the IRR but with a focus on [net cash](../n/net_cash.md) flows:

\[ NPV = \sum \frac{CF_t}{(1 + NIRR)^t} = 0 \]

Where:
- \( CF_t \) represents the net [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) at time t.
- \( NIRR \) is the Net Internal [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md).
- \( t \) is the time period.

To find the NIRR, one must solve for the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) (\(NIRR\)) that makes the NPV equal to zero. This typically involves iterative methods or financial calculators as there is no explicit solution.

## Comparison with IRR

### Key Differences

- **Inclusion of Outflows**: NIRR includes both inflows and outflows of cash, whereas IRR typically considers only inflows after the initial investment.
- **Realistic Assumptions**: NIRR provides a more realistic measure, especially for projects with fluctuating cash flows that might include additional investments or costs.
- **Complexity**: NIRR is often more complex to calculate as it requires detailed tracking of all cash flows over time.

### Advantages

- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Accounts for all financial aspects of an investment, including recurring costs and additional investments.
- **Realistic Projections**: Offers a more realistic projection of a project's profitability by considering all associated financial flows.
- **Better Decision-Making**: Provides more complete information for decision-makers, particularly in complex financial environments.

### Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: More complicated to calculate compared to IRR, requiring advanced financial knowledge and tools.
- **Data Requirements**: Necessitates detailed and accurate financial records of all cash flows.

## Practical Applications

### Project Evaluation

NIRR is particularly useful in evaluating long-term projects, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investments, and [capital](../c/capital.md)-intensive industries where cash flows can vary significantly over time.

### Portfolio Management

Investment managers use NIRR to assess the performance of investment portfolios, considering both the returns and additional costs or investments required over the investment period.

### Venture Capital

Venture capitalists use NIRR to evaluate the potential returns of [startup](../s/startup.md) investments, which often involve [multiple](../m/multiple.md) rounds of [financing](../f/financing.md) and varying cash flows.

## Example Calculation

Consider a project with the following cash flows:

- Initial Investment: $100,000
- Year 1: $30,000 inflow
- Year 2: $40,000 inflow
- Year 3: $50,000 inflow
- Year 4: $20,000 additional investment
- Year 5: $70,000 inflow

To calculate the NIRR, we would find the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) that sets the NPV of these cash flows to zero.

\[ 0 = \frac{-100,000}{(1 + NIRR)^0} + \frac{30,000}{(1 + NIRR)^1} + \frac{40,000}{(1 + NIRR)^2} + \frac{50,000}{(1 + NIRR)^3} + \frac{-20,000}{(1 + NIRR)^4} + \frac{70,000}{(1 + NIRR)^5} \]

Using financial software or iterative methods, assume we find an NIRR of approximately 10%.

## Conclusion

Net Internal [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) provides a crucial, comprehensive measure for evaluating the profitability and feasibility of investments. By considering all inflows and outflows, it offers a more realistic view of an investment's potential returns. Despite its complexity, NIRR is essential for informed financial decision-making, particularly in environments with fluctuating cash flows.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Net Internal Rate of Return and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Net Internal Rate of Return as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.
