# New High

A new high occurs when price reaches a level that exceeds all prior prices over a defined lookback period, such as a 52 week high or an all time high.

## Significance
- New highs can signal strong momentum and demand.
- They can attract breakout traders and trend followers.
- They can also trigger profit taking if the move is extended.

## Example
A stock trades above its 52 week high with rising volume. Traders may view this as a breakout and look for continuation.

## Practical notes
New highs are more meaningful when accompanied by volume, broad market strength, and supportive fundamentals.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for New High and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating New High as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For New High, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying New High. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use New High alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
