# Nasdaq

The Nasdaq, an acronym for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, is the second-largest stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in the world by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), only surpassed by the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE). Headquartered in New York City, it was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), which is now known as the Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The Nasdaq quickly gained prominence by being one of the first exchanges to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) electronic trading, significantly contributing to the evolution of modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## History and Evolution

The origins of Nasdaq can be traced back to the need for a transparent and automated [execution](../e/execution.md) system to facilitate the trading of over-the-counter (OTC) securities. Traditionally, OTC transactions relied heavily on telephone-based communications between brokers and dealers, a method that was often slow and error-prone. The need for an automated solution led to the launch of Nasdaq in February 1971, which offered electronic screens displaying real-time prices and [trade](../t/trade.md) information.

Over the decades, Nasdaq evolved from being an electronic [quote](../q/quote.md) system to a full-fledged securities [exchange](../e/exchange.md). In 1991, it introduced the Small [Order](../o/order.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md) System (SOES), a revolutionary tool that automated and streamlined the process of executing small retail orders. In 1998, Nasdaq merged with the American Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (Amex), further solidifying its status in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Market Structure and Listings

Nasdaq operates through a multi-tiered [market](../m/market.md) structure consisting of the following segments:

1. **Nasdaq Global Select [Market](../m/market.md)**: This segment comprises companies that meet the highest listing standards in terms of financial and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) measures.
2. **Nasdaq Global [Market](../m/market.md)**: Designed for mid-tier companies, this segment requires moderate listing standards.
3. **[Nasdaq Capital Market](../n/nasdaq_capital_market.md)**: Aimed at smaller companies, this segment has less stringent [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md), allowing emerging companies to access public [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md).

As of 2023, Nasdaq hosts over 3,300 [listed](../l/listed.md) companies across various sectors, including technology, healthcare, consumer services, and financials.

## Trading Mechanisms

Nasdaq uses a [dealer market](../d/dealer_market.md), where [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [market](../m/market.md) makers compete to provide the best [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices. [Market](../m/market.md) makers are [broker-dealer](../b/broker-dealer.md) firms that assume the [risk](../r/risk.md) of holding a particular [security](../s/security.md) to facilitate trading. Key features of Nasdaq's trading mechanism include:

- **Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)**: These are automated systems that match buy and sell orders for securities without the need for a traditional stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
