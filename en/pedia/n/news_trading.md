# News Trading

News trading uses market reactions to economic releases, earnings, or breaking headlines. The goal is to capture short term volatility triggered by new information.

## Inputs and Timing
Key inputs include economic calendars, earnings schedules, and real time news feeds. Speed matters because price moves often occur within seconds. Many strategies focus on the surprise component relative to consensus expectations.

## Strategy Approaches
Some strategies trade the initial momentum after a positive or negative surprise. Others fade exaggerated moves once liquidity returns. Event driven positioning ahead of scheduled releases is another common approach.

## Execution Risks
Spreads often widen around news events, and slippage can be severe. Data delays, false headlines, or conflicting reports can create sudden reversals. Risk limits and automated circuit breakers are essential.

## Conclusion
News trading can be profitable but requires fast execution, reliable data, and strict discipline. It is not suitable for all strategies or risk profiles.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for News Trading and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating News Trading as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For News Trading, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying News Trading. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use News Trading alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
