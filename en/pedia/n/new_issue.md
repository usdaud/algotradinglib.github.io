# New Issue

A "new [issue](../i/issue.md)" refers to a [security](../s/security.md) that is being sold to the public for the first time. This process typically occurs through an initial public [offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO) but can also involve the issuance of new securities by companies that are already publicly traded. In both cases, new issues play a vital role in the fundraising activities of companies and provide investors with opportunities to buy securities directly from the issuing entity.

## Definition of New Issue

A new [issue](../i/issue.md) is a [security](../s/security.md)—such as a stock, [bond](../b/bond.md), or other [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md)—that is sold for the first time on the [open market](../o/open_market.md). When a company decides to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) through the issuance of securities, it releases these "new issues" to investors. These securities can be either [equity](../e/equity.md)-based, such as [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock, or [debt](../d/debt.md)-based, such as bonds.

## Key Characteristics of New Issues

1. **[Primary Market](../p/primary_market.md)**: New issues occur in the [primary market](../p/primary_market.md), where securities are created and sold for the first time. Once purchased, these securities can be traded in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md).
2. **[Underwriting](../u/underwriting.md)**: This process involves [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) or [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) firms that help the issuing company determine the initial [offering price](../o/offering_price.md), buy the securities from the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), and then sell them to the public.
3. **[Prospectus](../p/prospectus.md)**: A legal document must be filed with regulatory authorities (e.g., the SEC in the United States) providing detailed information about the company, the [security](../s/security.md), and the risks involved.
4. **Regulatory Approval**: The new [issue](../i/issue.md) must receive approval from relevant regulatory bodies before it can be sold to the public.

## How It Works in Offerings

### Initial Public Offering (IPO)

When a [private company](../p/private_company.md) decides to go public for the first time, it undertakes an IPO. This allows the company to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) from public investors by selling [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock.

#### Steps in an IPO

1. **Selection of Underwriters**: The company hires one or more [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) to manage the IPO process.
2. **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) and Regulatory Filings**: The company and its underwriters submit detailed filings (S-1 Registration Statement in the U.S.) to regulatory authorities.
3. **Pricing and [Roadshow](../r/roadshow.md)**: The underwriters help determine the initial [offering price](../o/offering_price.md) and conduct a "[roadshow](../r/roadshow.md)" to attract potential investors.
4. **Allocation and [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: [Shares](../s/shares.md) are allocated to institutional and individual investors and subsequently begin trading on a public [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

### Follow-On Offering

Companies that are already publicly traded can [issue](../i/issue.md) additional securities, known as a [follow-on offering](../f/follow-on_offering.md). This allows them to raise more [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md).

#### Types of Follow-On Offerings

1. **Dilutive [Offering](../o/offering.md)**: New [shares](../s/shares.md) are issued, diluting the [value](../v/value.md) of existing [shares](../s/shares.md).
2. **Non-Dilutive [Offering](../o/offering.md)**: Existing shareholders sell their [shares](../s/shares.md), and no new [shares](../s/shares.md) are created.

### Debt Offerings

A company can also [issue](../i/issue.md) new bonds to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). The key steps in a [debt](../d/debt.md) [offering](../o/offering.md) include:

1. **Selection of Underwriters**: Similar to IPOs, [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) are selected to advise and manage the [offering](../o/offering.md).
2. **Regulatory Filings**: Necessary documents (e.g., a [bond](../b/bond.md) [prospectus](../p/prospectus.md)) are filed with relevant authorities.
3. **Pricing and [Rating](../r/rating.md)**: Bonds are priced, and they may receive a [rating](../r/rating.md) from a [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agency.
4. **[Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: The bonds are sold to investors and begin trading in the [bond market](../b/bond_market.md).

## Example: A Hypothetical IPO Process

Let’s walk through a hypothetical example to illustrate how a new [issue](../i/issue.md) works in an IPO setting. Suppose a tech company, "TechInnovate," decides to go public.

1. **Selection of Underwriters**: TechInnovate hires reputable [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to manage its IPO.
2. **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) and Filing**: TechInnovate, with the help of its underwriters, prepares the S-1 Registration Statement, providing an in-depth look at its financials, [business](../b/business.md) model, and risks. This is submitted to and reviewed by the SEC.
3. **Pricing and [Roadshow](../r/roadshow.md)**: The underwriters conduct a [roadshow](../r/roadshow.md) to drum up [interest](../i/interest.md) among institutional investors and gather feedback to help set the initial [offering price](../o/offering_price.md) of $15 per share.
4. **IPO Day**: Finally, on the day of the IPO, [shares](../s/shares.md) are allocated to institutional investors first, and remaining [shares](../s/shares.md) are made available to the public. TechInnovate successfully sells 10 million [shares](../s/shares.md), raising $150 million.

TechInnovate's [shares](../s/shares.md) begin trading on the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) under the [ticker symbol](../t/ticker_symbol.md) "TECI." After the IPO, these [shares](../s/shares.md) can be traded in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) among investors.

## Conclusion

New issues are essential mechanisms for companies seeking to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) while [offering](../o/offering.md) opportunities for investors to participate in the growth of these enterprises. Whether it's an initial public [offering](../o/offering.md), a [follow-on offering](../f/follow-on_offering.md), or a [debt](../d/debt.md) issuance, the process of bringing new securities to [market](../m/market.md) involves meticulous planning, regulatory compliance, and significant collaboration between the issuing company and [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) firms. Understanding how new issues work provides a valuable lens through which to view the broader financial landscape.
