# NAV Tracking Strategies

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), one of the sophisticated techniques that traders employ to ensure superior performance and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is the use of NAV (Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md)) tracking strategies. This approach caters to [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) involving ETFs ([Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds), mutual funds, and other investment vehicles where maintaining alignment or balance with the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets or benchmarks is crucial.

## What is NAV?

NAV stands for Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md), representing the per-share [value](../v/value.md) of a [fund](../f/fund.md)’s assets less its liabilities. It's calculated by dividing the total [value](../v/value.md) of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s portfolio (less liabilities) by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md). NAV is a critical metric for mutual funds and ETFs, reflecting the approximate [value](../v/value.md) at which investors can buy or sell one share of the [fund](../f/fund.md).

## Importance of NAV Tracking

Accurate NAV tracking is vital for several reasons:

1. **Fair [Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: Ensures that the buying and selling of [fund](../f/fund.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) occur at fair and accurate prices.
2. **Performance Measurement**: Helps investors and [fund](../f/fund.md) managers assess performance relative to benchmarks.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Required for consistent and reliable reporting to regulatory bodies.
4. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Confidence**: Builds [trust](../t/trust.md) with investors by providing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accuracy in pricing.

## NAV Tracking Strategies

### 1. Intraday NAV Proxies

#### Description
Intraday NAV proxies are estimates of NAV that [fund](../f/fund.md) managers use during trading hours, as the official NAV is calculated at the [market](../m/market.md)'s close. These proxies are crucial for ETFs that [trade](../t/trade.md) throughout the day on stock exchanges.

#### Methodology
- **Real-time Data Utilization**: [Incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) of real-time prices of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities.
- **Algorithmic Models**: Leveraging statistical models to estimate the intraday NAV dynamically.
- **[Discount](../d/discount.md)/[Premium](../p/premium.md) Monitoring**: Tracking the deviation of [market](../m/market.md) prices from estimated NAV to manage and execute trades effectively.

### 2. Basket Trading

#### Description
Basket trading involves trading a group (or "basket") of securities to mimic the performance of an [investment fund](../i/investment_fund.md) or [index](../i/index_instrument.md). This strategy is prevalent among ETFs that seek to replicate an [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

#### Methodology
- **Creation and [Redemption](../r/redemption.md) Mechanism**: Authorized participants (APs) create or redeem ETF [shares](../s/shares.md) by exchanging a basket of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities.
- **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) Opportunities**: APs exploit [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities when there is a discrepancy between the ETF's [market price](../m/market_price.md) and its NAV.
- **Close Matching**: Ensuring the basket of securities closely matches the composition and weightings of the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s portfolio.

### 3. Index Replication

#### Description
[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) replication involves building a portfolio that exactly or approximately matches the components of a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md). This strategy is fundamental for [index](../i/index_instrument.md) funds and ETFs.

#### Methodology
- **Full Replication**: Holding all the securities in the same proportions as the [index](../i/index_instrument.md).
- **[Sampling](../s/sampling.md)**: Holding a [representative sample](../r/representative_sample.md) of securities that match the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)’s [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) characteristics.
- **[Optimization](../o/optimization.md) Models**: Using [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) to minimize tracking errors while managing [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

### 4. Dynamic Hedging

#### Description
[Dynamic hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md) involves adjusting the position sizes of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities or [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to maintain alignment with the NAV.

#### Methodology
- **Continuous [Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md)**: Frequently adjusting the portfolio to reflect changes in the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Using [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) like [futures](../f/futures.md) or [options](../o/options.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [market](../m/market.md) movements.
- **Algorithmic Adjustments**: Employing algorithms to automate hedging decisions based on predefined criteria.

### 5. Statistical Arbitrage

#### Description
Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) utilizes statistical and [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) to identify mispriced assets expected to converge to their [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) over time.

#### Methodology
- **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Betting that the price of a mispriced [security](../s/security.md) [will](../w/will.md) revert to its historical mean.
- **[Pairs Trading](../p/pairs_trading.md)**: Simultaneously buying and selling correlated securities to exploit relative price movements.
- **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md)**: Implementing machine [learning algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) to predict price movements and optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
