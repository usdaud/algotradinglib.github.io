# Non-Parametric Inference

Non-parametric inference is a broad area within the domain of statistical inference, which makes no strong assumptions about the form of the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) from which the sampled data are drawn. Unlike parametric methods that assume a specific [distribution](../d/distribution.md) (e.g., [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md)) and estimate the parameters of that [distribution](../d/distribution.md), non-parametric methods are more flexible. They rely on fewer assumptions about the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) data structure, making them particularly useful in scenarios where parametric assumptions cannot be validated or are inappropriate.

## Key Features of Non-Parametric Inference

### Flexibility
Non-parametric methods are versatile and can be applied to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of data types and structures. They do not require the data to fit a predetermined model, which makes them suitable for more complex or unknown distributions.

### Robustness
Non-parametric methods tend to be more [robust](../r/robust.md) to outliers and slight deviations from model assumptions. Since they don't rely on parameters defined by specific distributions, outliers have less impact on the results.

### Data-Driven Approaches
Non-parametric inference relies heavily on the data itself to make inferences. This can lead to more accurate representations of the data, especially in situations where the true [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) is complex or unknown.

### Kernel Methods
Kernel methods are a fundamental component of non-parametric inference. They allow for smooth estimation of functions such as probability densities and regression curves. Kernels essentially weigh data points in a localized manner, enabling more nuanced data examination.

## Common Non-Parametric Techniques

### Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
Kernel Density Estimation is a popular method for estimating the [probability density function](../p/probability_density_function.md) of a random variable. KDE smooths out the data by averaging over a local neighborhood around each data point.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

$$
\hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{n h} \sum_{i=1}^{n} K\left(\frac{x - x_i}{h}\right)
$$

Where:
- \( \hat{f}(x) \) is the estimated density at point \( x \)
- \( n \) is the number of observations
- \( h \) is the bandwidth parameter
- \( K \) is the kernel function
- \( x_i \) are the sampled points

### Bootstrap Methods
[Bootstrap](../b/bootstrap.md) methods involve repeatedly resampling with replacement from the observed data to estimate the [sampling distribution](../s/sampling_distribution.md) of a statistic. This allows for [robust](../r/robust.md) estimation of [confidence intervals](../c/confidence_intervals.md), standard errors, and other statistical measures without making specific parametric assumptions.

**Procedure:**
1. Randomly select a sample (with replacement) from the original dataset.
2. Calculate the statistic of [interest](../i/interest.md) for this resampled data.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times (usually several thousand iterations).
4. Construct [confidence intervals](../c/confidence_intervals.md) and other relevant [statistics](../s/statistics.md) from the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of the [bootstrap](../b/bootstrap.md) samples.

### Rank-Based Methods
Rank-based methods (such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U test) do not rely on the actual data values but rather on their ranks. These methods are effective when dealing with ordinal data or when the distributional assumptions of parametric tests are not met.

**Example: Mann-Whitney U Test:**
- It is a non-parametric test used to determine whether there is a difference between the distributions of two independent samples.
- It compares the ranks of the data points from the two samples to test the [null hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md) that the two samples come from the same [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

### Smoothing Splines
Smoothing splines are used for regression and non-parametric smoothing of data. They fit a smooth curve through the data points by optimizing a [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between the fit quality and the smoothness of the curve.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

$$
\min_{f} \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - f(x_i))^2 + \[lambda](../l/lambda.md) \int \left[ f''(x) \right]^2 dx \right\}
$$

Where:
- \( y_i \) are the observed values
- \( f(x_i) \) are the estimated values from the spline
- \( \[lambda](../l/lambda.md) \) is the smoothing parameter that controls the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between the [goodness-of-fit](../g/goodness-of-fit.md) and smoothness

### K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple, yet powerful, non-parametric method used for classification and regression. The prediction for a given point is made based on the values of its k-nearest neighbors in the data.

**Procedure for K-NN Classification:**
1. Choose the number \( k \) of neighbors.
2. Compute the distance between the query point and all the points in the dataset.
3. Sort the distances and determine the \( k \) closest points.
4. Assign the most common class label (for classification) or the average [value](../v/value.md) (for regression) among the \( k \)-nearest neighbors to the query point.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), non-parametric methods [offer](../o/offer.md) several benefits, particularly in dealing with the vast and diverse types of financial data. Here are a few specific applications:

### Risk Management
Non-parametric methods can be employed to estimate [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR) and Conditional [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (CVaR) without making specific distributional assumptions. For example, [historical simulation](../h/historical_simulation.md), a non-parametric approach, uses [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) data to estimate the quantiles of the [return](../r/return.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) directly.

### Price Prediction
Non-parametric [regression methods](../r/regression_methods_in_trading.md), such as kernel regression and K-NN, can be used to predict future stock prices based on past prices and other relevant features. These methods do not assume a specific functional form and can adapt to the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) data patterns.

### Volatility Estimation
Kernel Density Estimation and other non-parametric methods can be utilized to estimate the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of financial instruments. This can be particularly advantageous when the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) pattern is not well-captured by parametric models.

### Statistical Arbitrage
Rank-based methods can be used to identify and exploit statistically significant differences between the pricing of related financial instruments. These methods can detect [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities without requiring specific parametric assumptions about the [return](../r/return.md) distributions.

### Portfolio Optimization
Non-parametric methods can enhance [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md) by providing more accurate estimates of the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of returns and risks. For instance, bootstrapping can be used to generate more [robust](../r/robust.md) estimations for the inputs to the [optimization](../o/optimization.md) process, such as expected returns and [covariance](../c/covariance.md) matrices.

### Algorithm Development and Backtesting
During the development and [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), non-parametric methods allow for a more comprehensive analysis by evaluating how strategies perform under a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of potential [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This can lead to more [robust](../r/robust.md) and adaptive [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Leading Companies and Tools

Several companies provide platforms and tools that facilitate the application of non-parametric methods in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md):

[Numerai](https://numer.ai) is a [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) that leverages [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and non-parametric methods to build [trading models](../t/trading_models.md). They aggregate models from a global community of data scientists to optimize their trading decisions.

### Quantopian (Defunct but relevant)
