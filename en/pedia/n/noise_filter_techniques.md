# Noise Filter Techniques

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), [noise](../n/noise.md) filtering is an essential process to reduce [market](../m/market.md) [noise](../n/noise.md) and improve the reliability of [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md). [Market](../m/market.md) [noise](../n/noise.md) refers to the random price fluctuations and insignificant movements that do not reflect the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [trend](../t/trend.md) or meaningful [market](../m/market.md) activity. Effective [noise](../n/noise.md) filtering techniques help in distinguishing between true [market](../m/market.md) signals and random [noise](../n/noise.md), which aids in making better trading decisions.

### Types of Noise Filter Techniques

#### 1. **Moving Averages (MA)**

Moving Averages are one of the simplest and most widely used techniques for filtering [noise](../n/noise.md) in trading data. The basic concept involves averaging the prices over a specific period to smooth out short-term fluctuations. The main types of moving averages are:

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** The [arithmetic mean](../a/arithmetic_mean.md) of a given set of values over a specific period. It's calculated by summing up the closing prices for a certain number of days and dividing by that number of days.
  
  \[
  \text{SMA} = \frac{P_1 + P_2 + \cdots + P_n}{n}
  \]

- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** Gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. The EMA can be calculated using the following formula:

  \[
  \text{EMA}_t = P_t \times \left(\frac{2}{n+1}\right) + \text{EMA}_{t-1} \times \left(1 - \frac{2}{n+1}\right)
  \]

- **[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) Moving Average (WMA):** Assigns different weights to each price point within the given period, typically placing more weight on recent prices.

#### 2. **Kalman Filters**

Kalman Filters are used in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) to predict and filter [time series](../t/time_series.md) data. This technique is particularly useful for smoothing noisy data and accurately estimating [underlying](../u/underlying.md) trends. The [Kalman Filter](../k/kalman_filter_in_trading.md) operates recursively on streams of noisy input data to produce a statistically optimal estimate of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) system state.

  \[
  \hat{x}_k = A \hat{x}_{k-1} + B u_k + K_k (z_k - H \hat{x}_{k-1})
  \]
  
Where:
- \( \hat{x}_k \) is the estimate of the state.
- \( A \) is the state transition matrix.
- \( B \) is the control input model.
- \( u_k \) is the control vector.
- \( K_k \) is the [Kalman gain](../k/kalman_gain_in_trading.md).
- \( z_k \) is the measurement at time \( k \).
- \( H \) is the observation model.

#### 3. **Bollinger Bands**

[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) are a [volatility](../v/volatility.md)-based [noise](../n/noise.md) filtering technique that consist of a moving average and two [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) bands above and below it. By using this method, traders can identify periods of high and low [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and potential [market](../m/market.md) [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals.

  - The bands widen during high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and contract during low [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
  - Prices moving close to the upper band suggest [overbought](../o/overbought.md) conditions, while prices near the lower band suggest [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

#### 4. **Fourier Transform**

The Fourier Transform is used in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) to transform [time series](../t/time_series.md) data from the time domain to the frequency domain. This technique helps in analyzing the various frequency components within the data, enabling traders to filter out high-frequency [noise](../n/noise.md) and focus on significant low-frequency trends.

- **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT):**

  \[
  X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i 2 \pi k n / N}
  \]

Where:
- \( X_k \) is the output.
- \( x_n \) is the input [time series](../t/time_series.md) data.
- \( N \) is the number of points in the data set.
- \( i \) is the imaginary unit.

#### 5. **Wavelet Transform**

[Wavelet Transform](../w/wavelet_transform_in_trading.md) is another mathematical technique employed to filter [noise](../n/noise.md) in trading data. Unlike Fourier Transform, which only provides frequency information, [Wavelet Transform](../w/wavelet_transform_in_trading.md) also provides time localization information, making it more effective in detecting and filtering fleeting [noise](../n/noise.md) spikes.

  - **Discrete [Wavelet Transform](../w/wavelet_transform_in_trading.md) (DWT) **:

    - Identifies and operates on different frequency components of the signal at various time scales.
  
  \[
  W_{\psi}(a, b) = \int x(t) \overline{\psi \left( \frac{t - b}{a} \right)} dt
  \]

  Where:
  - \( W_{\psi}(a, b) \) is the [Wavelet Transform](../w/wavelet_transform_in_trading.md).
  - \( a \) and \( b \) are scaling and translation parameters.
  - \( x(t) \) is the input [time series](../t/time_series.md) data.
  - \( \psi \) is the mother wavelet.

#### 6. **Low-Pass Filters**

Low-pass filters allow signals with a frequency lower than a designated cutoff frequency to pass through and attenuate signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. They help in reducing high-frequency [noise](../n/noise.md) and smoothing out the price series:

  - **Butterworth Filter:**
    - Provides a maximally flat frequency response in the passband.
    
    \[
    H(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{s}{\omega_c}\right)^{2n}}}
    \]

  - **Chebyshev Filter:**
    - Provides steeper roll-off than Butterworth but with ripples in the passband or stopband.
    
    \[
    H(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \epsilon^2 T_n^2\left(\frac{s}{\omega_c}\right)}}
    \]
