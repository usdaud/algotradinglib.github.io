# National Registration Database (NRD)

The National Registration Database (NRD) is a crucial component in the regulatory framework overseeing the securities and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) sectors in Canada. It is an online system operated by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) to facilitate the registration of individuals and firms involved in the securities [market](../m/market.md). In broad strokes, the NRD resembles a comprehensive digital registry that ensures the integrity of [market](../m/market.md) participants by maintaining up-to-date records and enabling regulatory oversight. This document delves into the technical, operational, and regulatory aspects of the NRD, as well as its significance in the financial ecosystem.

## Overview of NRD

The NRD provides a centralized standard for the registration and ongoing compliance of firms and individuals in the securities and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md). It is an online platform where [industry](../i/industry.md) participants submit registration forms, update information, and track their registration status. When a [firm](../f/firm.md) or individual needs to register in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) jurisdictions, the NRD greatly simplifies the process by eliminating the need for separate filings.

The system was launched in 2003 and has evolved to incorporate enhanced functionalities and better user interfaces, addressing the evolving needs of stakeholders within the [industry](../i/industry.md). By leveraging a digital framework, the NRD reduces paperwork, improves accuracy, and provides real-time information to both [market](../m/market.md) participants and regulators.
