# OEX

The OEX, or Standard & Poor's 100 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (S&P 100), is a stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) created by Standard & Poor's (S&P), which measures the stock performance of 100 large companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the US stock exchanges. The OEX, also known as the S&P 100, is a subset of the S&P 500, including the largest and most established US companies with [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-[listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md), making it one of the key indices in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). 

## Overview

### Index Composition

The S&P 100 [index](../i/index_instrument.md) comprises 100 major blue-chip companies selected from the S&P 500. The selection is based on various criteria such as [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [industry](../i/industry.md) representation. The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) provides a broad snapshot of the performance of leading US companies, covering diverse sectors such as technology, [finance](../f/finance.md), healthcare, consumer services, and energy.

#### Characteristics:
- **[Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md):** The constituents are among the largest firms by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), ensuring that the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) captures a significant portion of the [market](../m/market.md)'s total [value](../v/value.md).
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):** Selected [stocks](../s/stock.md) are required to have high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), which facilitates active trading and reliable [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md).
- **[diversification](../d/diversification.md):** The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) covers a wide array of sectors, which helps in diversifying the [risk](../r/risk.md) for investors looking at the performance of the US [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

### Calculation

The S&P 100 is calculated using the [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) method. Each stock in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is [weighted](../w/weighted.md) according to its total [market value](../m/market_value.md) relative to the total [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the other [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md). This weighting mechanism ensures that larger companies have a more significant impact on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s performance.

#### Formula:
The price of the S&P 100 [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Level} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{100} (P_i \times Q_i)}{D} \]

Where:
- \(P_i\) is the price of stock \(i\)
- \(Q_i\) is the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock \(i\)
- \(D\) is the divisor, which is adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions.

### Options Trading

A notable feature of the OEX is that it is one of the most widely traded [options](../o/options.md) indices, which provides investors with opportunities to [hedge](../h/hedge.md), [leverage](../l/leverage.md), and speculate. The Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CBOE) offers [options](../o/options.md) contracts on the S&P 100, making it an important instrument for traders and portfolio managers.

#### Types of OEX Options:
- **American-Style [Options](../o/options.md):** Allow the holder to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the option at any time before the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
- **European-Style [Options](../o/options.md):** Can only be exercised on the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
- **[Index Options](../i/index_options.md):** Provide a way to [trade](../t/trade.md) based on the overall movement of the 100 [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) rather than individual [stocks](../s/stock.md).

## Historical Performance

The S&P 100 has historically been a [robust](../r/robust.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of major movements in the US [economy](../e/economy.md) and has generally mirrored the performance of the broader S&P 500. Given its focus on [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md), the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) tends to be less volatile than smaller-cap or sector-specific indices.

### Major Milestones:
- **1983:** The CBOE introduced [options](../o/options.md) on the OEX, which became an instrumental tool for [market](../m/market.md) participants.
- **2000s:** The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) saw significant changes as technology companies grew in [valuation](../v/valuation.md), leading to a heavier weight in tech firms.
- **2008-2009:** The [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) led to large swings in [index](../i/index_instrument.md) values, reflecting the economic turmoil.
- **2020-Present:** The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented [volatility](../v/volatility.md), but the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) has largely recovered, supported by technology and healthcare sectors.

## Role in Portfolio Management

### Benchmarking

The S&P 100 serves as an important [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for [fund](../f/fund.md) managers and investors. It is often compared against other indices like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average to evaluate performance. Because the S&P 100 represents the leading companies, many investment funds [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) their performance against this [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Hedging and Diversification

Investors use [options](../o/options.md) on the S&P 100 to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their portfolios against [market](../m/market.md) risks. By buying [put options](../p/put_options.md), for example, they can protect against declines in the [market](../m/market.md). Conversely, call [options](../o/options.md) allow investors to benefit from upward movements in the [market](../m/market.md). Additionally, the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s broad [industry](../i/industry.md) coverage provides built-in [diversification](../d/diversification.md), which is crucial for managing [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Strategies

Several trading and [investing](../i/investing.md) strategies revolve around the OEX, including:
- **[Index Arbitrage](../i/index_arbitrage.md):** This involves exploiting price differences between the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) and its [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md).
- **[Covered Call Writing](../c/covered_call_writing.md):** Selling call [options](../o/options.md) on [stocks](../s/stock.md) held within the S&P 100 to generate [income](../i/income.md).
- **Protective Puts:** Buying puts on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential downturns in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Comparisons with Other Indices

### S&P 100 vs. S&P 500

While the S&P 500 includes a broader array of 500 companies, the S&P 100 focuses on the top 100, which generally are more stable and have a larger [market](../m/market.md) impact. The performance of the S&P 100 often approximates that of the S&P 500 due to the significant overlap in [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md). However, the S&P 100 may exhibit less [volatility](../v/volatility.md) due to its concentration on established firms.

### S&P 100 vs. NASDAQ-100

The [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100 includes 100 largest non-financial companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), which gives it a heavier weighting towards technology companies. On the other hand, the S&P 100 is more diversified across different sectors. This makes the S&P 100 less technology-focused and potentially less volatile than the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100.

## Technological and Analytical Tools

### Algo Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) has seen increased use in trading S&P 100 [options](../o/options.md) due to the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and the [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) opportunities provided. Algorithms can be designed to exploit small price discrepancies, execute trades at optimal times, and manage [risk](../r/risk.md) more effectively.

#### Key Tools:
