# Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA)

The [Options](../o/options.md) Price Reporting Authority, commonly referred to as OPRA, plays an essential role in the financial and trading sectors, particularly within [options](../o/options.md) trading. OPRA serves a critical function in consolidating and disseminating [trade](../t/trade.md) and [quote](../q/quote.md) information regarding [options](../o/options.md) contracts. This comprehensive look at OPRA [will](../w/will.md) delve into its history, functionality, and impact on the trading ecosystem, especially highlighting its importance in [options](../o/options.md) trading and financial technologies.

## Introduction to OPRA

### History and Formation

OPRA was established in 1975 by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) and the [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC). It was designed to [offer](../o/offer.md) a streamlined and centralized reporting system for [options](../o/options.md) price data. Prior to OPRA's creation, [options](../o/options.md) trading lacked a standardized method for reporting real-time price information, leading to inconsistent data and inefficiencies in the [market](../m/market.md).

### Mission and Purpose

The primary mission of OPRA is to facilitate a transparent, efficient, and competitive [options](../o/options.md) marketplace. It does this by ensuring accurate and timely dissemination of [market](../m/market.md) data, which includes last [sale](../s/sale.md) information and current [options](../o/options.md) quotes. OPRA operates under strict regulatory oversight to maintain [market](../m/market.md) integrity and [investor](../i/investor.md) [trust](../t/trust.md).

## OPRA’s Structure and Governance

### Consortium of Exchanges

OPRA operates as a cooperative effort among [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [options](../o/options.md) exchanges. Originally, it was formed by the American Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) and the Philadelphia Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md). Today, it includes major exchanges like the Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CBOE), [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) OMX, and others. This consortium ensures a collaborative environment and data uniformity across the [industry](../i/industry.md).

### Data Dissemination

OPRA's [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) allows for the collection, [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md), and dissemination of [options](../o/options.md) price data from all participating exchanges. This centralized approach provides a single source of real-time information for brokers, traders, and other [market](../m/market.md) participants. The data is disseminated through various [market](../m/market.md) data vendors, which include financial news services and trading platforms.

## OPRA Data and Its Importance

### Types of Data Provided

OPRA provides two primary types of data:

1. **Last [Sale](../s/sale.md) Information**: This includes the price at which the last [trade](../t/trade.md) of an [options contract](../o/options_contract.md) occurred.
2. **Current Quotes**: This includes the best available [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices for [options](../o/options.md) contracts.

### Real-Time and Historical Data

OPRA not only disseminates real-time data but also offers historical data crucial for [backtesting trading strategies](../b/backtesting_trading_strategies.md), [market](../m/market.md) analysis, and regulatory compliance. The availability of comprehensive historical data supports both research and strategic decision-making.

### Impact on Trading Strategies

For traders, especially those involved in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), OPRA data is invaluable. It supports the development and refinement of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) by providing essential information needed to model price movements, assess [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and execute trades effectively. Access to accurate, real-time data ensures that trading decisions are based on the most current [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Technology and Infrastructure

### Data Feeds

OPRA utilizes high-capacity data feeds to ensure that [market](../m/market.md) participants receive timely updates. The use of state-of-the-art technology enables it to [handle](../h/handle.md) large volumes of data efficiently. This [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) is pivotal in maintaining the speed and reliability required in modern trading environments.

### Redundancy and Reliability

Given the critical nature of the data it handles, OPRA implements [robust](../r/robust.md) redundancy and disaster recovery measures. This ensures continuous availability, even in the face of hardware failures, network issues, or other unforeseen problems.

### Integration with Trading Platforms

Financial technology firms and trading platforms integrate OPRA's data feeds into their systems to provide users with real-time information. This integration is seamless, allowing traders to access [options](../o/options.md) price data effortlessly within their trading interfaces. Popular trading platforms like Thinkorswim by TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md), [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md), and others rely on OPRA data for their [options](../o/options.md) trading functionalities.

## Regulatory and Compliance Aspects

### Adherence to SEC Regulations

OPRA operates under the oversight of the SEC, adhering to stringent regulations designed to protect investors and ensure fair and efficient markets. Compliance with SEC rules ensures that OPRA's data dissemination practices are transparent and reliable.

### Market Surveillance and Reporting

Apart from providing price data, OPRA plays a role in [market](../m/market.md) surveillance. By consolidating [trade](../t/trade.md) and [quote](../q/quote.md) information across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) exchanges, it aids regulatory bodies in monitoring [market](../m/market.md) activities and identifying potential manipulative behaviors or anomalies.

## OPRA's Role in Financial Technologies (FinTech)

### Algorithmic Trading
