# Out-of-Pocket Expenses

Out-of-pocket expenses are expenditures paid directly by an individual, as opposed to being covered by an external funding source such as [insurance](../i/insurance.md), grants, or their employer. These costs frequently arise in various contexts such as medical expenses, travel, education, and certain investments, and can have significant financial implications if not managed properly.

## Medical Out-of-Pocket Expenses

In the healthcare [industry](../i/industry.md), out-of-pocket expenses often refer to the costs that patients must pay themselves for medical services. These can include copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance. Despite having [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md), individuals often still bear a portion of the cost, which can vary significantly based on their healthcare plan and the services required.

### Components of Medical Out-of-Pocket Expenses

1. **Copayments**: A fixed amount you pay for a covered health care service after you've paid your deductible. For example, you may pay $20 for a doctor's visit, with the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) covering the rest.
2. **Deductibles**: The amount you pay out-of-pocket for covered health care services before your [insurance](../i/insurance.md) plan starts to pay. For example, if your deductible is $1,000, your plan won’t pay anything until you’ve spent $1,000 on covered services subject to the deductible.
3. **Coinsurance**: Your share of the costs of a covered service, calculated as a percentage of the allowed amount for the service. For example, if the allowed amount for an office visit is $100 and you've met your deductible, your coinsurance [payment](../p/payment.md) of 20% would be $20.
