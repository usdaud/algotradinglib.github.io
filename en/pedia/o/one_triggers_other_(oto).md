# One Triggers Other (OTO)

A one triggers other order is a conditional sequence where one order becomes active only after a different order is filled. It is commonly used to automate multi step trading plans.

## How it works
- A primary order is placed first.
- When it fills, a secondary order activates.
- The secondary order may be a stop, limit, or another entry.

## Example
A trader places a limit buy at 90. If it fills, a stop loss order at 85 is triggered and becomes active.

## Practical notes
OTO orders help structure complex workflows but rely on broker support and clear order handling rules.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for One Triggers Other (OTO) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating One Triggers Other (OTO) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For One Triggers Other (OTO), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying One Triggers Other (OTO). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use One Triggers Other (OTO) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
