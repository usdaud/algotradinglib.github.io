# Outside Days

In the world of trading and [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), patterns and indicators play a crucial role in helping traders make informed decisions. One such pattern that can provide insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and potential price movements is the concept of "Outside Days." This term refers to specific [candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md) that occur on a price chart and can signal potential reversals, continuations, or other significant [market](../m/market.md) actions. In this article, we [will](../w/will.md) explore what outside days are, how they are identified, their implications, and how traders can incorporate them into their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Definition and Characteristics

An "Outside Day" is a [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) pattern where the high and the low of a given trading day exceed the high and the low of the previous trading day. Essentially, the day's [range](../r/range.md) completely engulfs the [range](../r/range.md) of the preceding day. This pattern indicates that the [market](../m/market.md) experienced higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and greater [price action](../p/price_action.md) compared to the prior day.

Outside days can occur in both bullish and bearish markets. When the daily price [range](../r/range.md) expands and engulfs the previous day's [range](../r/range.md), it suggests a potential shift in [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), as buyers and sellers are actively contesting control.

### Bullish Outside Day

A bullish outside day occurs when the low of the current trading day is lower than the low of the previous day, and the high of the current trading day is higher than the high of the previous day. This pattern might indicate that after testing lower price levels, buying strength emerged to push the prices higher, potentially signaling the start of a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Bearish Outside Day

A bearish outside day, on the other hand, happens when the high of the current trading day is higher than the high of the previous day, and the low of the current trading day is lower than the low of the previous day. This pattern can often suggest that after testing higher price levels, selling pressure increased, potentially indicating the beginning of a bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).

## Identifying Outside Days

Identifying outside days on a price chart involves the following steps:

1. **Examine Daily Candles**: Look at daily candlesticks on a price chart.
2. **Compare Ranges**: Compare the high and low of the current day with the high and low of the previous day.
3. **[Check](../c/check.md) for Engulfing**: Confirm that the current day's [range](../r/range.md) fully engulfs the previous day's [range](../r/range.md).

When these criteria are met, the pattern can be categorized as an outside day.

### Examples

Consider the following two scenarios on a price chart:

- On Day 1, the price [range](../r/range.md) is from a low of $100 to a high of $110.
- On Day 2, the price [range](../r/range.md) expands to a low of $95 and a high of $115.

In this case, Day 2's [price action](../p/price_action.md) engulfed the entire [range](../r/range.md) of Day 1, indicating an outside day. If Day 2 closed higher than the [open](../o/open.md), it would be labeled as a bullish outside day. Conversely, if it closed lower than the [open](../o/open.md), it would be a bearish outside day.

## Implications of Outside Days

Outside days are significant because they reflect heightened [market](../m/market.md) activity and potential changes in sentiment. Traders and analysts often interpret these patterns as early signals of larger price movements.

### Potential Reversal

One common interpretation is that outside days can signal potential reversals. For instance, in an ongoing [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), a bullish outside day might indicate that the selling pressure is weakening and buying [interest](../i/interest.md) is increasing, leading to a potential upward [reversal](../r/reversal.md). Conversely, in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), a bearish outside day might suggest that buying pressure is diminishing and selling [interest](../i/interest.md) is gaining strength, signaling a possible downward [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

### Continuation Pattern

While outside days can indicate potential reversals, they can also be [continuation patterns](../c/continuation_patterns.md). For example, in a strong [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), a bullish outside day might reinforce the prevailing bullish sentiment, suggesting that the [trend](../t/trend.md) is likely to continue. Similarly, in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), a bearish outside day might confirm ongoing bearish [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

## Trading Strategies Incorporating Outside Days

[Trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that incorporate outside days often focus on the potential for significant price movements following these patterns. Here are a few strategies that traders might use:

### Breakout Strategy

Given the heightened [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of outside days, traders might look for [breakout](../b/breakout.md) opportunities. For example, after identifying a bullish outside day, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might set a buy [order](../o/order.md) slightly above the high of the outside day, anticipating a continued upward movement. Similarly, after a bearish outside day, a sell [order](../o/order.md) might be placed just below the low of the outside day, expecting further downward movement.

### Reversal Strategy

Traders might also use outside days to identify potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points. For instance, in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), spotting a bearish outside day could prompt traders to close long positions or initiate short positions, anticipating a [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md). Conversely, in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), a bullish outside day might signal traders to consider closing short positions or entering long positions.

### Confirmation with Other Indicators

To increase the reliability of [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md) generated by outside days, traders often use additional [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) for confirmation. Moving averages, [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI), and [volume analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md) can provide further context and strengthen the trading decision.

## Advantages and Limitations of Using Outside Days

Like any trading pattern or [indicator](../i/indicator.md), outside days have their advantages and limitations:

### Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Outside days are relatively simple to identify on a price chart.
- **Early Signals**: They can provide early warnings of potential [trend](../t/trend.md) changes or continuations, allowing traders to position themselves advantageously.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Indication**: The pattern highlights increased [market](../m/market.md) activity and [volatility](../v/volatility.md), which can present trading opportunities.

### Limitations

- **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**: As with any technical pattern, outside days can generate [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), leading to potential losses if not used with caution.
- **Over-reliance**: Relying solely on outside days without considering other factors (e.g., broader [market](../m/market.md) trends, [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md)) can be risky.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Context**: The effectiveness of outside days can vary depending on the overall [market](../m/market.md) context and the timeframe being analyzed.

## Conclusion

Outside days are a valuable [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) pattern in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), reflecting heightened [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential shifts in [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). By understanding the characteristics and implications of outside days, traders can enhance their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and make more informed decisions. Whether used for identifying reversals, continuations, or breakouts, outside days can be a useful tool in a [trader](../t/trader.md)'s arsenal. However, like any trading pattern, they should be used judiciously and in conjunction with other analysis techniques to maximize their effectiveness.
