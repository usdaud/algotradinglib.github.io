# Order Splitting Strategies

[Order](../o/order.md) splitting strategies are critical techniques in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), designed to minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact and optimize [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md). When traders execute large orders, they can significantly affect the [market price](../m/market_price.md). By breaking these large orders into smaller ones, the impact on the [market](../m/market.md) can be mitigated, leading to better [execution](../e/execution.md) prices and reduced [slippage](../s/slippage.md).

## Introduction to Order Splitting

### What is Order Splitting?

[Order](../o/order.md) splitting refers to the process of dividing a large [trade](../t/trade.md) [order](../o/order.md) into [multiple](../m/multiple.md) smaller orders and executing them over a set period or at different price points. This technique aims to reduce the [visibility](../v/visibility.md) of the [trade](../t/trade.md) and minimize the [market](../m/market.md) impact, which can otherwise move prices unfavorably against the [trader](../t/trader.md).

### Why Use Order Splitting?

1. **Minimize [Market](../m/market.md) Impact**: Large orders can shift [market](../m/market.md) prices due to [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) imbalances. By splitting the [order](../o/order.md), the impact is spread over time, reducing price distortions.
2. **Reduce [Slippage](../s/slippage.md)**: [Slippage](../s/slippage.md) occurs when there is a difference between the expected price of a [trade](../t/trade.md) and the actual price. Smaller orders help to achieve better matching of expected and executed prices.
3. **Improve [Execution](../e/execution.md) Quality**: By using advanced algorithms to split and time trades, traders can potentially secure more favorable conditions for each segment of the [order](../o/order.md).

## Types of Order Splitting Strategies

### 1. Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

#### Definition

VWAP is a trading [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) that calculates the average price a [security](../s/security.md) has traded at throughout the day, based on both [volume](../v/volume.md) and price. 

#### Strategy

An [order](../o/order.md) is split into several smaller orders based on the historical [volume](../v/volume.md) pattern of the [security](../s/security.md). Orders are placed to reflect the proportion of trading [volume](../v/volume.md) at different times of the day.

#### Benefits

- Ensures that trades converge towards the average [market price](../m/market_price.md).
- Reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of significant price deviations.

#### Drawbacks

- Less effective in highly volatile markets.
- Not suitable for securities with irregular trading volumes.

### 2. Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)

#### Definition

TWAP calculates the average price of a [security](../s/security.md) over a specified time period. This strategy is time-based, irrespective of the trading [volume](../v/volume.md).

#### Strategy

An [order](../o/order.md) is divided into equal-sized smaller orders to be executed at regular intervals over a specified [duration](../d/duration.md).

#### Benefits

- Simple and predictable [execution](../e/execution.md) pattern.
- Reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of concentrating trades in a specific time period.

#### Drawbacks

- May not perform well in markets with significant price movements.
- Ignores trading [volume](../v/volume.md), which might lead to poor [execution](../e/execution.md) in low-[liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) periods.

### 3. Implementation Shortfall (IS)

#### Definition

Implementation [Shortfall](../s/shortfall.md) measures the difference between the decision price and the final [execution](../e/execution.md) price, aiming to minimize this gap.

#### Strategy

Orders are split and strategically executed to minimize the overall cost of trading, considering [market](../m/market.md) conditions and urgency.

#### Benefits

- Focuses on reducing the total cost of [execution](../e/execution.md).
- Can adapt to real-time [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

#### Drawbacks

- Complexity in implementation.
- Requires sophisticated analytics and real-time decision-making.

### 4. Percent of Volume (POV)

#### Definition

POV strategies align the [execution](../e/execution.md) of an [order](../o/order.md) with a predetermined percentage of [market](../m/market.md) [volume](../v/volume.md).

#### Strategy

Orders are split in proportion to the trading [volume](../v/volume.md) of the [security](../s/security.md). For example, if the [trader](../t/trader.md) aims to be 10% of the trading [volume](../v/volume.md), orders [will](../w/will.md) be scaled accordingly throughout the day.

#### Benefits

- Matches with the [market](../m/market.md)'s [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
- Reduces [market](../m/market.md) impact.

#### Drawbacks

- May not be suitable for urgent trades.
- Complex to predict exact [execution](../e/execution.md) timelines.

### 5. Market on Close (MOC)

#### Definition

MOC strategies involve executing trades at the closing price of the trading day.

#### Strategy

The [order](../o/order.md) is split throughout the day with the accumulated [volume](../v/volume.md) executed at the closing price.

#### Benefits

- Capitalizes on the end-of-day price, which is less volatile.
- Suitable for less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) securities.

#### Drawbacks

- [Execution](../e/execution.md) relies heavily on the closing auction.
- [Risk](../r/risk.md) of significant price movements towards the close.

## Advanced Order Splitting Techniques

### 1. Adaptive Algorithms

[Adaptive algorithms](../a/adaptive_algorithms.md) dynamically adjust the [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) strategy based on real-time [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This involves sophisticated [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models that can predict price movements and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) availability.

#### Benefits

- Highly responsive to [market](../m/market.md) changes.
- Potentially better [execution](../e/execution.md) by leveraging data patterns.

#### Drawbacks

- Requires extensive computational resources.
- Complexity in development and maintenance.

### 2. Dark Pool Execution

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) are private exchanges for trading securities that are not available to the public. These platforms allow for anonymous trading, minimizing [market](../m/market.md) impact.

#### Benefits

- Reduces the [visibility](../v/visibility.md) of large orders.
- Can achieve better [execution](../e/execution.md) prices without affecting the public [market](../m/market.md).

#### Drawbacks

- Lack of [transparency](../t/transparency.md).
- Potential regulatory concerns.
