# Options Assignment

Options assignment is the process by which an option writer is obligated to deliver or receive the underlying when the holder exercises. Assignment occurs randomly among short positions at the clearing level.

## How it works
- A call assignment obligates the writer to sell the underlying at the strike.
- A put assignment obligates the writer to buy the underlying at the strike.
- Assignment can occur before expiration for American options.

## Example
A trader is short a 100 strike call. The option holder exercises. The short call writer must deliver shares at 100, even if the market price is higher.

## Practical notes
Assignment risk increases when options are deep in the money and near expiration, especially around dividend dates. Monitoring position exposure is important.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Options Assignment and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Options Assignment as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Options Assignment, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Options Assignment. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Options Assignment alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
