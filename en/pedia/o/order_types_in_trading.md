# Order Types

In the realm of trading, understanding the various types of orders available to traders is crucial for effectively managing investments and mitigating risks. Different [order](../o/order.md) types serve different purposes and are suited for various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Here, we [will](../w/will.md) dive into the most commonly used [order](../o/order.md) types in trading, explaining their functionalities, advantages, and potential disadvantages.

## Market Order

A [market order](../m/market_order.md) is the simplest type of [order](../o/order.md). It is an [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) immediately at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). The main objective of a [market order](../m/market_order.md) is to ensure the [execution](../e/execution.md) of the [trade](../t/trade.md) as quickly as possible.

### Characteristics of Market Orders
- **Immediate [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Executed at the best available current price.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: [Market](../m/market.md) orders contribute to [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
- **No Price Guarantee**: The [execution](../e/execution.md) price may differ from the last traded price, especially in volatile markets.

### Advantages
- **Speed**: Ensures rapid [execution](../e/execution.md) of the [trade](../t/trade.md).
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and execute, making it suitable for beginners.

### Disadvantages
- **Price [Slippage](../s/slippage.md)**: Executing at a different price than expected, particularly in volatile markets.
- **Lack of Control**: Traders cannot specify a price limit.

## Limit Order

A [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) is an [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) at a specific price or better. A [buy limit order](../b/buy_limit_order.md) can only be executed at the limit price or lower, while a sell [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) can only be executed at the limit price or higher.

### Characteristics of Limit Orders
- **Price Control**: Traders can set the maximum or minimum price at which they are willing to buy or sell.
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md) [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: There is no guarantee that the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) be filled.

### Advantages
- **Price Control**: Protects against buying at too high and selling at too low prices.
- **Flexibility**: Traders can specify conditions under which the [order](../o/order.md) should be executed.

### Disadvantages
- **Partial Fill**: The [order](../o/order.md) may be partially filled if there isn’t enough [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) at the specified price.
- **Non-[Execution Risk](../e/execution_risk.md)**: There is a [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [order](../o/order.md) might not be executed if the [market](../m/market.md) does not reach the specified price.

## Stop Order

A [stop order](../s/stop_order.md), also known as a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md), is an [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) once its price reaches a specified level, known as the stop price. Once the stop price is reached, the [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) becomes a [market order](../m/market_order.md).

### Types of Stop Orders
- **[Buy Stop Order](../b/buy_stop_order.md)**: Placed above the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) and is usually used to limit a loss or protect a [profit](../p/profit.md) on a [short sale](../s/short_sale.md).
- **Sell [Stop Order](../s/stop_order.md)**: Placed below the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) and is typically used to protect a long position.

### Advantages
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Helps limit losses or protect profits.
- **Automation**: Automatically becomes a [market order](../m/market_order.md) once the stop price is triggered.

### Disadvantages
- **Price [Slippage](../s/slippage.md)**: May be executed at a price different from the stop price in volatile markets.
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md) After Trigger**: The [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) be executed regardless of price discrepancies once the stop price is hit.

## Stop-Limit Order

A [stop-limit order](../s/stop-limit_order.md) combines features of a [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) and a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md). It becomes a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) once the stop price is reached, specifying a minimum price that must be met for the [trade](../t/trade.md) to be executed.

### Characteristics of Stop-Limit Orders
- **Two Prices Specified**: Includes both a stop price and a limit price.
- **Conditional [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: [Order](../o/order.md) is subjected to both stop and limit conditions.

### Advantages
- **Controlled [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Provides precision by setting both stop and limit prices.
- **Reduced [Slippage](../s/slippage.md)**: Eliminates the [risk](../r/risk.md) of being executed at an unfavorable price.

### Disadvantages
- **Non-[Execution Risk](../e/execution_risk.md)**: The [order](../o/order.md) may not be filled if the [market price](../m/market_price.md) doesn’t reach the limit price.
- **Complexity**: More complex than standard stop or limit orders.

## Trailing Stop Order

A [trailing stop](../t/trailing_stop.md) [order](../o/order.md) is a dynamic [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) that adjusts the stop price at a fixed percentage or dollar amount away from the [market price](../m/market_price.md) as it moves in the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s favor.

### Characteristics of Trailing Stop Orders
- **Adjustment Mechanism**: The stop price moves along with price fluctuations.
- **Protection and Flexibility**: Protects profits by trailing the [market price](../m/market_price.md) while capping potential losses.

### Advantages
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Preservation**: Locks in profits as prices move favorably.
- **Automatic Adjustment**: Automatically adapts to [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity in Setup**: More complex to configure correctly.
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md) [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: Similar risks to regular stop orders in volatile markets.

## Market-if-Touched (MIT) Order

A [Market](../m/market.md)-if-Touched (MIT) [order](../o/order.md) is an [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) at the best available price once a predetermined [price level](../p/price_level.md) is reached. It becomes a [market order](../m/market_order.md) when the specified price (the touch price) is hit.

### Characteristics of MIT Orders
- **Trigger Mechanism**: The [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is triggered only after touching the specified price.
- **Immediate [Execution](../e/execution.md) Post-Trigger**: Converts to a [market order](../m/market_order.md) upon triggering.

### Advantages
- **Conditional [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Provides the advantage of conditional [execution](../e/execution.md) to buy or sell at favorable prices.

### Disadvantages
- **Price [Risk](../r/risk.md) Post-Trigger**: Similar to [market](../m/market.md) orders, it may result in unfavorable price [execution](../e/execution.md) after the trigger.

## Fill or Kill (FOK) Order

A Fill or [Kill](../k/kill.md) (FOK) [order](../o/order.md) is an [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell that must be executed immediately in its entirety; otherwise, the entire [order](../o/order.md) is canceled.

### Characteristics of FOK Orders
- **Immediate [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Must be filled completely at the time of placing the [order](../o/order.md).
- **All-or-Nothing Principle**: Either the entire [order](../o/order.md) is filled instantly or it is canceled.

### Advantages
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md) [Assurance](../a/assurance.md)**: Ensures that the [trader](../t/trader.md) does not end up with a partial fill.
- **Time Sensitivity**: Useful for time-sensitive trades requiring complete fills.

### Disadvantages
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md) [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: Increased [risk](../r/risk.md) of non-[execution](../e/execution.md) due to the stringent requirements.

## Immediate or Cancel (IOC) Order

An Immediate or Cancel (IOC) [order](../o/order.md) is an [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell that must be executed immediately. Any portion of the [order](../o/order.md) that cannot be filled instantly is canceled.

### Characteristics of IOC Orders
- **Partial Fulfillment**: Allows partial [execution](../e/execution.md), unlike FOK orders.
- **Quick [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Must be filled within seconds of being placed.

### Advantages
- **Partial [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Facilitates immediate trading while allowing partial fills.
- **Flexibility**: A more flexible alternative to FOK for obtaining quick fills.

### Disadvantages
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) of Partial Fil**: May not fully meet the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s needs if not completely filled.

## Good till Date (GTD) Order

A Good till Date (GTD) [order](../o/order.md) is an [order](../o/order.md) that remains active until a specified date. If the [order](../o/order.md) is not executed by this date, it is automatically canceled.

### Characteristics of GTD Orders
- **Expiry Condition**: Active until a specific expiry date.
- **Long-Term Planning**: Useful for executing trades over a longer [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md).

### Advantages
- **Time Flexibility**: Provides a longer window for potential [execution](../e/execution.md).
- **Strategic [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Suitable for longer-term [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Disadvantages
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) of Non-[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: If the [market](../m/market.md) does not reach the desired price by the expiry date, the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be fulfilled.

## Good till Cancelled (GTC) Order

A Good till Cancelled (GTC) [order](../o/order.md) remains active until the [order](../o/order.md) is canceled by the [trader](../t/trader.md). Unlike GTD orders, GTC orders do not have a defined expiry date.

### Characteristics of GTC Orders
- **Persistence**: Remains [open](../o/open.md) indefinitely until canceled.
- **Longevity**: Suitable for trades where the [trader](../t/trader.md) can wait for an optimal price.

### Advantages
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md) Over Time**: Allows traders to wait for the [market](../m/market.md) to move to their desired price levels.
- **Less Monitoring**: Requires less frequent monitoring compared to day or GTD orders.

### Disadvantages
- **Potential Oversight**: Traders might forget to cancel outdated orders.
- **Variable [Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: [Market](../m/market.md) conditions may change, leading to unintended executions.

## Day Order

A [day order](../d/day_order.md) is an [order](../o/order.md) that is only valid for the trading day on which it is placed. If the [order](../o/order.md) is not executed by the end of the trading day, it is automatically canceled.

### Characteristics of Day Orders
- **Same-Day Expiry**: Valid only for the trading day.
- **Temporal Limit**: Specific to the immediate [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

### Advantages
- **Day-Trading Alignment**: Suitable for [intraday trading](../i/intraday_trading.md) strategies.
- **Automatic Cancellation**: Reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of unintended trades in the future.

### Disadvantages
- **Limited [Execution](../e/execution.md) Window**: If the [market](../m/market.md) doesn’t reach the desired price, the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be executed.
- **Constant Monitoring**: Requires active monitoring by the [trader](../t/trader.md) during the trading day.
