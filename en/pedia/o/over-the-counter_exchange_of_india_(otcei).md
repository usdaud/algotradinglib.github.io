# Over-the-Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI)

The Over-the-Counter [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) of India (OTCEI) represents a landmark initiative to streamline the trading of securities not traditionally [listed](../l/listed.md) on major stock exchanges. Founded in 1990 under the Companies Act of 1956, OTCEI was established to provide micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with an efficient platform to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in otherwise illiquid securities. Born out of the need to address the inadequacies of traditional exchanges in accommodating small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), OTCEI aimed to serve as India's answer to the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) in the United States.

## Objectives and Mission

The primary objectives of OTCEI included:
- Facilitating the [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising capabilities of smaller firms.
- Ensuring greater [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for securities that might otherwise struggle to garner attention on traditional exchanges.
- Enhancing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protection for investors dealing in smaller and less-known companies.
- Providing a regulated environment that encourages confidence among both issuers and investors.

The overarching mission was to democratize [investing](../i/investing.md) by ensuring that the powerhouse financial resources available in larger markets could be accessed by smaller enterprises, hence assisting in their growth and [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

## History

### Formation and Early Years

OTCEI was conceptualized in the late 1980s to cater to the surging number of startups and MSMEs looking for efficient ways to sustain growth through public funding. It was inaugurated with the active participation and backing of prominent financial institutions such as Unit [Trust](../t/trust.md) of India (UTI), Industrial [Credit](../c/credit.md) and Investment [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) of India (ICICI), Industrial Development [Bank](../b/bank.md) of India (IDBI), [Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) of India (LIC), and General [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (GIC) along with its subsidiaries.

### Technological Pioneering

As one of the first exchanges in India to introduce fully automated, screen-based [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), OTCEI brought a new level of sophistication and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) to the Indian securities [market](../m/market.md). This technological innovation minimized manual errors and biases by [offering](../o/offering.md) real-time, electronic [order](../o/order.md) matching and [execution](../e/execution.md) system which was revolutionary during its time of inception.

### Challenges and Decline

Despite its novel concepts and aggregating over 100 listings in its early years, OTCEI faced significant operational challenges:
- Competition from larger and established exchanges like the Bombay Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (BSE) and National Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NSE) overshadowed OTCEI's influence.
- Limited [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and inadequate [marketing](../m/marketing.md) hampered the OTC model in India.
- The cultural lag in [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence toward electronically-managed exchanges delayed wider adoption.
- Economic liberalization in the early '90s shifted MSMEs' inclination towards [bank](../b/bank.md) [financing](../f/financing.md) rather than public listings.

### De-Operationalization

By the year 2015, the [market](../m/market.md) conditions and lack of substantial trading volumes led to the decision of ceasing operations. The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) struggled to remain financially viable and faced stiff competition from more successful platforms. Eventually, OTCEI officially stopped its trading operations, marking an end to an ambitious yet struggling venture.

## Structure and Functionality

### Membership

The OTCEI model was unique in the sense that it did not list traditional companies outright but centered around [market](../m/market.md) makers who facilitated transactions between buyers and sellers of securities. Membership categories included brokers, issuers, and investors.

### Products Listed

- **[Equity](../e/equity.md) [Shares](../s/shares.md):** [Stocks](../s/stock.md) of small and medium-cap companies that were not [listed](../l/listed.md) on major stock exchanges.
- **Bonds and Debentures:** Various forms of [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments provided a diversified portfolio option for investors.
- **Mutual Funds and Other Collective Investment Schemes:** [Offering](../o/offering.md) units of financial instruments which pooled resources from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors.

### Market Making

Inspired by the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) model, OTCEI utilized [market](../m/market.md) makers, who played a crucial role. These [market](../m/market.md) makers quoted buy and sell prices ensuring [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for the [listed](../l/listed.md) securities. This continuous [quotation](../q/quotation.md) of prices reduced the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md) and enhanced trading [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

## Regulatory Framework

[Robust](../r/robust.md) oversight was ensured with OTCEI being under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Board of India (SEBI). [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) rules and regulations were designed to [offer](../o/offer.md) substantial protection to investors and create an environment conducive to fair trading practices.

### Listing Requirements

Strict listing norms were prescribed by OTCEI intended to ensure reliability and [investor](../i/investor.md) [trust](../t/trust.md):
- A prescribed minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) requirement.
- Mandatory [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) norms for [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and operational health.
- Auditing standards and periodic compliance reports aligning with SEBI guidelines.
- Promotional restrictions to avert any misleading claims by companies seeking listings.

### Investor Protection Measures

A slew of measures were put forth, including:
- [Investor](../i/investor.md) grievance cells.
- Regular audits and inspections.
- Strict action against fraudulent or errant operators.

## Technological Innovations

### Automated Trading System

OTCEI’s [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) was pioneering in [offering](../o/offering.md) on-screen trading minimizing human error. The automated trading model, featuring efficient [order](../o/order.md) matching, laid down a new template in Indian securities trading.

### Transparency and Efficiency

The automated [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) brought unprecedented [transparency](../t/transparency.md) to the [market](../m/market.md). [Transaction](../t/transaction.md) data was readily available, reducing information asymmetry and instilling confidence among investors.

## Legacy and Impact

Despite ceasing operations, OTCEI’s larger technological and institutional impacts are momentous:
- Paved the path for other exchanges and trading platforms to embrace technology and improve [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).
- Highlighted the significance of dedicated SME platforms for [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).
- Served as a [learning curve](../l/learning_curve.md), showcasing the vital institutional infrastructural prerequisites for burgeoning [startup](../s/startup.md) ecosystems.

## Conclusion

The Over-the-Counter [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) of India remains a crucial chapter in India's financial history, illustrating the innovative efforts toward integrating smaller enterprises into the mainstream [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md). While it struggled and eventually shuttered, the lessons learned from OTCEI greatly informed subsequent developments within the broader financial and trading ecosystem in India. Innovating how securities were traded and focusing on SMEs, OTCEI endeavored to carve out a space in a highly competitive [market](../m/market.md), setting the groundwork for future advancements in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
