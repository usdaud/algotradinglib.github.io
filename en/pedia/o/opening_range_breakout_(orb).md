# Opening Range Breakout (ORB)

An opening range breakout is a strategy that trades a break above or below the initial range formed shortly after the market opens. The opening range is often defined as the first 5 to 30 minutes of trading.

## Setup
- Define the opening range high and low.
- Enter on a break of the range in the direction of the breakout.
- Place a stop on the opposite side of the range.

## Example
A stock trades between 50 and 51 during the first 15 minutes. A breakout above 51 triggers a long entry with a stop below 50. The target may be a measured move or prior resistance.

## Strengths and weaknesses
ORB can capture early momentum but fails during choppy sessions. Volume confirmation and market context improve reliability.

## Practical notes
The choice of opening range length affects signal quality. Short ranges produce more signals but higher noise.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Opening Range Breakout (ORB) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Opening Range Breakout (ORB) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Opening Range Breakout (ORB), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Opening Range Breakout (ORB). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Opening Range Breakout (ORB) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
