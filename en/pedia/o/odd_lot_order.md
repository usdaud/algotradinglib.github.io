# Odd Lot Order

An odd lot order is an order for a quantity of shares that is smaller than the standard lot size. In many equity markets, a round lot is 100 shares, so any order below that size is an odd lot.

## Why it matters
- Odd lots may receive different execution priority on some venues.
- They can be less visible in certain market data feeds.
- Retail orders often use odd lot sizes.

## Example
A trader buys 37 shares of a stock. This is an odd lot order because it is below 100 shares.

## Practical notes
Odd lot activity can be significant in heavily traded stocks, especially for retail flow. Some exchanges now include odd lots in the consolidated quote to improve transparency.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Odd Lot Order and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Odd Lot Order as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Odd Lot Order, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Odd Lot Order. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Odd Lot Order alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
