# On-the-Run Treasury Yield Curve

The [On-the-Run Treasury](../o/on-the-run_treasury.md) [yield curve](../y/yard.md) (OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md)) represents the yields of the most recently issued [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities across various maturities. It is a critical concept in the financial and trading world, particularly in fixed-[income](../i/income.md) trading, as it provides a snapshot of the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates available in the government securities [market](../m/market.md) for various durations. This document [will](../w/will.md) delve into the nuances of the OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md), its formation, applications, and its comparison with other types of [yield](../y/yield.md) curves.

## Introduction to Treasury Securities

[U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities are [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments issued by the federal government to [finance](../f/finance.md) its [obligations](../o/obligation.md). These securities are considered among the safest investments because they are backed by the "full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md)" of the U.S. government. There are several types of Treasury securities, including:

- **Treasury Bills (T-Bills):** Short-term securities with maturities of one year or less.
- **[Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) (T-Notes):** Medium-term securities with maturities ranging from two to ten years.
- **Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds):** Long-term securities with maturities greater than ten years.
- **Treasury [Inflation-Protected Securities](../i/inflation-protected_securities.md) (TIPS):** Securities that provide protection against [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

## Definition of On-the-Run Treasuries

On-the-Run Treasuries are the most recently issued [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities for each [maturity](../m/maturity.md). They are considered more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than their older counterparts, known as [Off-the-Run Treasuries](../o/off-the-run_treasuries.md), because they are more actively traded. The yields of these On-the-Run securities form the OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md).

## Characteristics of OTR Yield Curve

1. **Representation of Current [Market](../m/market.md) Rates:**
 The OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md) provides a clear picture of the prevailing [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for different maturities.

2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):**
 On-the-Run Treasuries are more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than [Off-the-Run Treasuries](../o/off-the-run_treasuries.md). Higher [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) means narrower [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md), making them attractive to investors and traders.

3. **[Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for Other [Debt](../d/debt.md) Instruments:**
 The OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md) serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for pricing other [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments. Its movements are closely watched by [market](../m/market.md) participants.

## Formation of the OTR Yield Curve

The OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md) is created by plotting the yields of On-the-Run Treasuries against their respective maturities. The [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) conducts auctions to [issue](../i/issue.md) new securities regularly. Each newly issued [security](../s/security.md) becomes the On-the-Run [security](../s/security.md) for its respective [maturity](../m/maturity.md) until the next issuance.

## Factors Influencing the OTR Yield Curve

1. **[Economic Indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md):**
 Economic data such as GDP growth, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates, and employment figures have a significant impact on the [treasury yield](../t/treasury_yield.md) curve.

2. **Federal Reserve Policy:**
 The Federal Reserve's [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), especially [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) decisions, directly affects the shape and level of the OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md).

3. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Sentiment:**
 [Market](../m/market.md) participants' [risk](../r/risk.md) appetite and expectations also play a crucial role. In times of economic [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), there may be a flight to quality, leading to a lower [yield](../y/yield.md) for Treasuries.

4. **[Supply](../s/supply.md) and [Demand](../d/demand.md) Dynamics:**
 The [demand](../d/demand.md) for Treasuries relative to their [supply](../s/supply.md) can influence their yields. Higher [demand](../d/demand.md) can drive yields down, while lower [demand](../d/demand.md) can push yields up.

## Applications of the OTR Yield Curve

1. **Benchmarking:**
 The OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md) is used as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for other [interest](../i/interest.md) rates in the [economy](../e/economy.md). [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) rates, [corporate bond](../c/corporate_bond.md) yields, and other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities often reference the OTR curve.

2. **Investment Decisions:**
 Investors use the OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md) to help inform decisions about which maturities to invest in, depending on their [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) outlook and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):**
 Financial institutions use the OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md) for [interest rate risk management](../i/interest_rate_risk_management.md). They analyze the curve's behavior to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential [market](../m/market.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes.

4. **[Economic Forecasting](../e/economic_forecasting.md):**
 Economists use the shape and movements of the OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md) to make inferences about future economic activities and potential recessions. An [inverted yield curve](../i/inverted_yield_curve.md), where short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, is often seen as a predictor of an economic downturn.

## Comparison with Other Yield Curves

### On-the-Run vs. Off-the-Run Yield Curve

- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):**
 On-the-Run securities are more [liquid](../l/liquid.md), often resulting in slightly lower yields compared to Off-the-Run securities of similar maturities.

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Preference:**
 On-the-Run Treasuries are usually preferred by institutional investors due to their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), facilitating easier [entry and exit strategies](../e/entry_and_exit_strategies.md).

### On-the-Run vs. Zero-Coupon Yield Curve

- **Cash Flows:**
 The Zero-Coupon [yield curve](../y/yard.md) is derived from securities that do not pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md), providing a direct measure of the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md).

- **Construction:**
 The construction of the Zero-Coupon [yield curve](../y/yard.md) involves [discounting](../d/discounting.md) cash flows to present values, whereas the OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md) uses actual yields of [liquid](../l/liquid.md) securities.

### On-the-Run vs. Swap Curve

- **[Issuer](../i/issuer.md):**
 The [Swap](../s/swap.md) curve is based on interbank rates and reflects the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of major banking institutions, whereas the OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md) reflects the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate of U.S. Treasuries.

- **Applications:**
 The [Swap](../s/swap.md) curve is often used for pricing [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments and managing [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) risks, while the OTR curve is mainly used for government securities and benchmarking purposes.

## Conclusion

The [On-the-Run Treasury](../o/on-the-run_treasury.md) [Yield Curve](../y/yard.md) is a fundamental component of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), serving as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for various [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and helping investors, traders, and economists make informed decisions. Its high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and representation of current [market](../m/market.md) conditions make it indispensable for a wide array of applications, from investment strategies to [economic forecasting](../e/economic_forecasting.md). Understanding the OTR [yield curve](../y/yard.md) and its nuances is essential for anyone involved in fixed-[income](../i/income.md) trading or [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md).
