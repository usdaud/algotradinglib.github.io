# Overdraft

An overdraft is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that allows an individual or [business](../b/business.md) to withdraw more [money](../m/money.md) from their [bank](../b/bank.md) account than they currently have, effectively borrowing from the [bank](../b/bank.md). It is a form of short-term lending that provides immediate access to cash, often used to manage [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues or cover unexpected expenses.

## Types of Overdrafts

There are two main types of overdrafts:

1. **Authorized Overdrafts**: This occurs when the [bank](../b/bank.md) agrees in advance that the account holder can withdraw more [money](../m/money.md) than is available in their account up to an approved limit. This type usually involves an arrangement [fee](../f/fee.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) charges, but the terms and rates are discussed and agreed upon in advance.

2. **Unauthorized Overdrafts**: This occurs when an account holder withdraws more [money](../m/money.md) than is available without prior arrangement with the [bank](../b/bank.md). Unauthorized overdrafts can be expensive due to high fees and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and repeated use can negatively impact the account holder's [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md).

## How Overdrafts Work

When you have an overdraft, your [bank](../b/bank.md) [account balance](../a/account_balance.md) can go below zero, allowing you to use more [money](../m/money.md) than you actually possess. This negative balance is essentially a [loan](../l/loan.md) from the [bank](../b/bank.md), which you [will](../w/will.md) need to repay. The specifics of how an overdraft works can vary depending on the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s policies and the type of account you [hold](../h/hold.md).

### Key Elements

1. **Overdraft Limit**: This is the maximum amount that can be overdrawn. It is usually set by the [bank](../b/bank.md) and can vary depending on the [customer](../c/customer.md)'s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) and banking history.

2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: These are the charges for borrowing [money](../m/money.md) through an overdraft. Rates can vary widely between authorized and unauthorized overdrafts.

3. **Fees**: There can be several types of fees associated with overdrafts, including arrangement fees, daily or monthly charges, and fees for exceeding the overdraft limit.

4. **[Repayment](../r/repayment.md)**: The overdrawn amount must be repaid, typically from future deposits into the account.

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Overdrafts provide immediate access to extra funds, which can be useful for managing short-term [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) issues.

- **No [Collateral](../c/collateral.md) Required**: Overdrafts are unsecured forms of [credit](../c/credit.md), meaning there is no need for [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to obtain them.

- **Lower Costs**: When compared to payday loans or [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) cash advances, authorized overdrafts can be a more cost-effective solution for short-term funding needs.

### Drawbacks

- **High Costs for Unauthorized Use**: Unauthorized overdrafts can be very expensive due to high [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and fees.

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) of [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Continuous reliance on overdrafts can lead to a cycle of [debt](../d/debt.md) that becomes difficult to break.

- **Impact on [Credit Score](../c/credit_score.md)**: Frequent use or abuse of overdrafts can negatively affect your [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md).

## Overdraft Protection

Banks often [offer](../o/offer.md) [overdraft protection](../o/overdraft_protection.md) services, which are designed to prevent account holders from incurring unauthorized overdraft fees. Here are some common forms of [overdraft protection](../o/overdraft_protection.md):

1. **Transfer from Savings**: Automatically transferring [money](../m/money.md) from a [linked savings account](../l/linked_savings_account.md) when the [checking account](../c/checking_account.md) balance is insufficient.

2. **Overdraft [Loan](../l/loan.md)**: Providing a small [loan](../l/loan.md) instead of allowing the account to become overdrawn.

3. **[Credit Card](../c/credit_card.md) Link**: Linking a [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) to the account to cover overdrafts.

## Regulatory Landscape

Different countries have varying regulations regarding overdrafts.

### United States
The Federal Reserve's Regulation E requires banks to obtain explicit consent from customers to provide overdraft services for [debit](../d/debit.md) card transactions and ATM withdrawals.

### United Kingdom
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has introduced rules to make overdrafts simpler, including a single [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for all overdrafts and a ban on fixed daily or monthly fees.

## FinTech and Overdraft Alternatives

The emergence of Financial Technology (FinTech) companies has led to the development of alternative solutions to traditional overdrafts. These include:

1. **[Peer-to-Peer Lending](../p/peer-to-peer_lending.md)**: Platforms that connect borrowers with lenders willing to provide short-term loans.

2. **Budgeting Apps**: Apps that help manage finances and alert users when they are at [risk](../r/risk.md) of overdrawing their accounts.

3. **Payday Advance Services**: FinTech companies [offer](../o/offer.md) payday advance services where employees can access earned wages before the actual payday.

## Example of Overdraft Services

### Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo provides a [range](../r/range.md) of overdraft services, including [overdraft protection](../o/overdraft_protection.md) where funds can be transferred from a [savings account](../s/savings_account.md), [credit card](../c/credit_card.md), or linked line of [credit](../c/credit.md) to cover overdrafts.

### Bank of America
[Bank](../b/bank.md) of America offers [overdraft protection](../o/overdraft_protection.md) to help customers avoid declined transactions, returned checks, and overdraft item fees by linking a [Bank](../b/bank.md) of America [credit card](../c/credit_card.md), savings, or second eligible [checking account](../c/checking_account.md).

## Conclusion

An overdraft can be a useful financial tool for managing short-term [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) needs but must be used responsibly. Understanding the terms, conditions, fees, and availability of alternatives is crucial to making informed decisions and avoiding costly consequences. With evolving technologies and regulations, the landscape of overdraft services continues to change, [offering](../o/offering.md) both challenges and opportunities for consumers and banks alike.
