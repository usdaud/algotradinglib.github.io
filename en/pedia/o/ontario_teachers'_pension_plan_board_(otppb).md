# Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (OTPPB)

The Ontario Teachers' [Pension Plan](../p/pension_plan.md) Board (OTPPB) is one of the world's largest and most sophisticated institutional investors. It was founded in 1990 and is responsible for managing the investment, administration, and funding of the Ontario Teachers' [Pension Plan](../p/pension_plan.md), which serves approximately 330,000 active and retired teachers in Ontario, Canada. This deep dive [will](../w/will.md) cover various facets of OTPPB, including its history, investment strategies, governance structure, and its significance in the financial world.

## History and Background 

Founded in 1990, OTPPB was created to manage the pension assets of Ontario teachers independently from the provincial government. Before its establishment, pension funds were traditionally managed by government entities, often leading to perceived inefficiencies and lack of [robust](../r/robust.md) investment strategies. The creation of OTPPB aimed to establish a more agile and [market](../m/market.md)-oriented approach to pension [fund](../f/fund.md) management.

## Governance Structure

OTPPB operates with a Board of Directors appointed jointly by the Ontario Teachers' Federation (OTF) and the Government of Ontario. OTPPB's governance structure is designed to balance the interests of its [multiple](../m/multiple.md) stakeholders. The board includes professionals with expertise in various fields, including [finance](../f/finance.md), law, and [business](../b/business.md), ensuring they possess the skills necessary to oversee a large, complex pension [fund](../f/fund.md).

### Management and Organization

The senior management team, led by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), handles day-to-day operations. OTPPB has employed a mix of financial professionals with diverse backgrounds in [asset management](../a/asset_management.md), [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment, and portfolio construction. The organization's strong governance has been a cornerstone of its success, ensuring accountability, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and alignment with the plan's long-term objectives.

## Investment Strategies

OTPPB is known for its sophisticated approach to [investment management](../i/investment_management.md), leveraging a diverse array of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and investment strategies to maximize returns while managing [risk](../r/risk.md). As of 2023, the [fund](../f/fund.md) manages over CAD 240 billion in net assets.

### Asset Allocation

OTPPB employs a [dynamic asset allocation](../d/dynamic_asset_allocation.md) strategy, [investing](../i/investing.md) in private and public equities, [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), real assets (including [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md)), and alternative investments like [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md). The allocation is periodically adjusted based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and the long-term nature of the pension liabilities.

- **Public Equities**: OTPPB invests in equities [listed](../l/listed.md) on stock exchanges globally. These investments are diversified across sectors and geographies to mitigate risks.
  
- **[Fixed Income](../f/fixed_income.md)**: This includes government and corporate bonds. OTPPB strategically invests in [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) to provide a stable [return](../r/return.md) and act as a counterbalance to more volatile [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.
  
- **Real Assets**: OTPPB has substantial investments in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).

- **[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds and Alternatives**: OTPPB also invests in [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and other alternative strategies to achieve non-correlated returns and additional [diversification](../d/diversification.md).
