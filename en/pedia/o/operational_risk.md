# Operational Risk

Operational [risk](../r/risk.md) is a category of [risk](../r/risk.md) that encompasses a variety of sources, including internal processes, personnel, systems, and external events. It is one of the most critical aspects of the [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) framework in financial institutions, trading firms, and other corporations. Operational [risk](../r/risk.md) is multifaceted and often intersects with other types of risks such as [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), and [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md). What differentiates operational [risk](../r/risk.md) is that it arises from within the operational boundaries of an organization, including its day-to-day activities, workflows, and control mechanisms.

## Key Components and Sources of Operational Risk

### Internal Processes
Internal processes refer to the sequence of operations or procedures that a company undertakes during its daily [business activities](../b/business_activities.md). Failures in these processes can lead to operational [risk](../r/risk.md). This can include:

- **Process Inefficiencies**: Inefficiencies in executing [business](../b/business.md) processes can lead to delays, increased costs, and missed opportunities.
- **Lack of Proper Controls**: The absence of [robust](../r/robust.md) [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md) can lead to errors, omissions, and even [fraud](../f/fraud.md).
- **Poor Documentation**: Inadequate documentation can lead to misunderstandings, wrong decisions, and a lack of accountability.

### Personnel
People play a critical role in any financial organization. Human error, [fraud](../f/fraud.md), and unethical behavior are significant sources of operational [risk](../r/risk.md). Key issues related to personnel include:

- **Human Error**: Mistakes made by employees can have far-reaching consequences.
- **Inadequate Training**: Employees who are not properly trained are more likely to make errors.
- **[Fraud](../f/fraud.md) and Misconduct**: Dishonest behavior can lead to significant financial losses and regulatory penalties.

### Systems
Technological failures are another significant source of operational [risk](../r/risk.md). This includes:

- **System Downtime**: Unplanned outages can disrupt [business activities](../b/business_activities.md) and lead to financial loss.
- **Cybersecurity Threats**: Cyber attacks can compromise sensitive data and disrupt operations.
- **Software Bugs and Glitches**: Software errors can result in incorrect data processing or [transaction](../t/transaction.md) errors.

### External Events
External factors can also introduce operational [risk](../r/risk.md), even when internal processes, systems, and personnel are functioning correctly. These include:

- **Natural Disasters**: Earthquakes, floods, and other natural events can disrupt [business activities](../b/business_activities.md).
- **Regulatory Changes**: Sudden changes in laws or regulations can impact operations.
- **[Supply Chain](../s/supply_chain.md) Disruptions**: Problems with suppliers can affect the availability of necessary resources.

## Measuring Operational Risk

Measuring operational [risk](../r/risk.md) is a complex task that requires a multidisciplinary approach. Several methods are commonly used, including:

### Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
KRIs are metrics that are used to indicate the level of [risk](../r/risk.md). They are often specific to the [firm](../f/firm.md) or the particular type of operational [risk](../r/risk.md) being measured. Common KRIs include:

- **Incident Counts**: The number of operational failures that have occurred.
- **Loss Amounts**: The financial impact of operational failures.
- **Control Effectiveness**: An assessment of how well existing controls are mitigating [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Loss Distribution Approach (LDA)
The [Loss Distribution](../l/loss_distribution.md) Approach involves collecting historical data on losses and fitting this data to a statistical [distribution](../d/distribution.md). This helps in estimating potential future losses and understanding the [range](../r/range.md) and likelihood of these losses.

### Scenario Analysis
[Scenario analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md) involves brainstorming various “what if” scenarios that could lead to operational [risk](../r/risk.md) events and estimating their impact. This can include both tail-[risk](../r/risk.md) events and more frequent, less severe occurrences.

### Risk Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)
RCSA is a structured approach by which [business](../b/business.md) units identify and assess operational risks and the effectiveness of controls. This usually involves:

- **Identifying Risks**: Listing potential risks.
- **Assessing [Risk](../r/risk.md) Impact**: Evaluating the financial and reputational impact of these risks.
- **Evaluating Controls**: Assessing the effectiveness of current controls to mitigate the identified risks.

## Mitigating Operational Risk

Mitigation strategies for operational [risk](../r/risk.md) involve a combination of preventive measures, detective controls, and corrective actions. Some common strategies include:

### Preventive Measures
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks to reduce human error.
- **Training and Development**: Providing continuous training programs to ensure that employees are well-prepared to [handle](../h/handle.md) their responsibilities.
- **[Robust](../r/robust.md) [Internal Controls](../i/internal_controls.md)**: Implementing controls to prevent errors and [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Detective Controls
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Setting up systems to continuously monitor key metrics and detect anomalies.
- **Internal Audits**: Performing regular audits to identify areas of weakness.
- **Incident Reporting**: Encouraging the reporting of incidents to identify patterns and root causes.

### Corrective Actions
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigating incidents to determine the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) causes.
- **Action Plans**: Developing and implementing plans to address identified weaknesses.
- **Policy Revisions**: Updating policies to mitigate future risks.

## Regulatory Frameworks

Various regulatory bodies around the world have established frameworks for managing operational [risk](../r/risk.md). Some notable frameworks include:

### Basel Accords
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has issued guidelines on the management of operational [risk](../r/risk.md) as part of the [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md) and [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) accords. These guidelines provide a standardized approach for measuring and managing operational [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
In the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates stricter regulatory requirements for [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md) and financial reporting, which indirectly helps in managing operational [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
The BIS also provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for [operational risk management](../o/operational_risk_management.md), primarily focused on the banking sector.

## Technology in Operational Risk Management

In recent years, technology has played an increasingly critical role in managing operational [risk](../r/risk.md). Innovations in areas such as [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) (AI), [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) (ML), and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) are transforming how firms manage these risks.

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
AI and ML are being used to:

- **Predict [Risk](../r/risk.md) Events**: Analyzing vast amounts of data to predict potential [risk](../r/risk.md) events.
- **Automate Processes**: Reducing human error by automating tasks.
- **Monitor and Detect Anomalies**: Real-time analysis to detect unusual patterns that may indicate [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Blockchain
[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology can be used to enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [security](../s/security.md) in transactions, thereby reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and errors.
