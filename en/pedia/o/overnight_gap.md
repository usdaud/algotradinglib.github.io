# Overnight Gap

An overnight gap is the difference between the prior session close and the next session open. It reflects price changes that occur outside regular trading hours.

## Causes
- Earnings releases or guidance updates.
- Economic data released outside market hours.
- Global market moves in other time zones.

## Trading impact
Overnight gaps can create slippage for stop orders and can change the risk profile of positions held overnight. Some strategies avoid overnight exposure to reduce gap risk.

## Example
A stock closes at 80 and opens at 74 after negative news. The 6 point drop is an overnight gap.

## Practical notes
Pre market volume and indicated open data can help estimate potential gaps, but gaps can widen right at the open.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Overnight Gap and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Overnight Gap as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Overnight Gap, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Overnight Gap. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Overnight Gap alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
