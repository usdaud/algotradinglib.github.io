# One Cancels Other (OCO)

A one cancels other order is a linked order pair where execution of one order automatically cancels the other. It is commonly used to set a profit target and a stop loss at the same time.

## How it works
- Two orders are linked: one for profit taking and one for risk control.
- When one order fills, the other is canceled.
- The trader monitors only a single combined instruction.

## Example
A trader buys a stock at 50 and sets an OCO with a sell limit at 55 and a stop at 47. If the price hits 55, the stop is canceled. If the price hits 47, the target order is canceled.

## Risks
OCO orders reduce manual errors but still face gaps and slippage. If price jumps through the stop level, the fill can be worse than expected.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for One Cancels Other (OCO) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating One Cancels Other (OCO) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For One Cancels Other (OCO), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying One Cancels Other (OCO). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use One Cancels Other (OCO) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
