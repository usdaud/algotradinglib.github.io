# One Day Trade

A one day trade is a trade that is opened and closed within the same trading session. It is a basic form of day trading that avoids overnight risk.

## Characteristics
- Positions are flat by the end of the session.
- Trades rely on intraday price movement and liquidity.
- Risk is managed with tight stops and defined time windows.

## Example
A trader buys a stock in the morning after a breakout and sells it in the afternoon before the close. The trade does not carry overnight exposure.

## Practical notes
Day trades are sensitive to transaction costs. Consistent risk control and execution quality are essential.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for One Day Trade and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating One Day Trade as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For One Day Trade, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying One Day Trade. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use One Day Trade alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
