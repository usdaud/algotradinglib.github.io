# Option Exercise

Option exercise is the process of using the rights embedded in an option contract. A call option exercise gives the holder the right to buy the underlying at the strike price, while a put option exercise gives the right to sell.

## Types of exercise
- American options can be exercised any time before expiration.
- European options can be exercised only at expiration.

## Example
A trader holds a call with a strike of 50 when the stock trades at 60. Exercising allows purchase at 50, creating an immediate gain, subject to costs and assignment rules.

## Practical notes
Many traders close options before expiration rather than exercise, to avoid capital requirements or delivery. Automatic exercise policies may apply when options finish in the money.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Option Exercise and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Option Exercise as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Option Exercise, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Option Exercise. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Option Exercise alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
