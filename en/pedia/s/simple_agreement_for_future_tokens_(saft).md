# Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT)

The Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) is a legal framework designed to facilitate investment in [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and cryptocurrency projects. It is a variant of the Simple Agreement for Future [Equity](../e/equity.md) (SAFE) used in traditional [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) and is adapted for token-based fundraising. The goal of the SAFT is to enable startups to raise funds without immediately distributing tokens, thus navigating the regulatory [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) surrounding initial coin offerings (ICOs) and token sales.

## Overview

The SAFT is a contract between a cryptocurrency developer and an [accredited investor](../a/accredited_investor.md). It offers the promise of future tokens in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for immediate [capital](../c/capital.md), but the tokens themselves are only distributed once the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) network is operational. This framework is specifically designed for projects where the tokens [will](../w/will.md) have [utility](../u/utility.md) within a functioning network, rather than serving as a [security](../s/security.md) or investment tool.

### Key Components

1. **Issuance:** The developer issues the SAFT to accredited investors, specifying the conditions under which the tokens [will](../w/will.md) eventually be issued.
2. **Fundraising:** Investors provide [capital](../c/capital.md) to the developer immediately, which can be used to [finance](../f/finance.md) the development of the project.
3. **Token Generation Event (TGE):** Once the network or platform is operational, and the conditions specified in the SAFT are met, the tokens are distributed to the investors.

## Legal and Regulatory Aspects

The SAFT framework was created to align with regulatory guidelines, particularly in jurisdictions like the United States, where the issuance of tokens can be subject to securities law. The key idea is to defer the issuance of tokens until they have a functional [utility](../u/utility.md), at which point they are less likely to be classified as securities.

### Securities Law

The [Howey Test](../h/howey_test.md), established by the Supreme Court in the United States, is often used to determine whether an [asset](../a/asset.md) constitutes a [security](../s/security.md). According to the [Howey Test](../h/howey_test.md), an investment contract exists if there is:

1. An investment of [money](../m/money.md)
2. In a common enterprise
3. With an expectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of others

By deferring token issuance until the network is operational, the SAFT aims to create a scenario where tokens are not predominantly investment vehicles, thus potentially avoiding classification as securities.

### Accredited Investors

The SAFT framework is generally restricted to accredited investors to comply with regulatory requirements. Accredited investors are defined by criteria set by regulatory bodies (such as the SEC in the United States), typically involving [income](../i/income.md) and [net worth](../n/net_worth.md) thresholds, which aim to ensure that investors have a certain level of financial sophistication and can bear the risks associated with the investment.

## Advantages of SAFT

1. **Regulatory Compliance:** Aims to align with securities laws, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of regulatory action.
2. **Flexibility:** Provides a flexible fundraising mechanism that adapts to the development timeline of the project.
3. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Protection:** By focusing on accredited investors, it ensures that participants are financially capable of understanding and taking on the risks involved.

## Criticisms and Challenges

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Access:** Restricting participation to accredited investors limits [market](../m/market.md) access and may be seen as contrary to the democratizing ethos of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technologies.
2. **Regulatory [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md):** Despite its intentions, the SAFT's regulatory status is not universally clear, with differing interpretations and enforcement in various jurisdictions.
3. **Token [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):** Early investors may have to wait a significant amount of time before they can access their tokens, during which their investment is illiquid.

## Use Cases

Several projects and companies have utilized the SAFT framework for their token sales. Examples include:

1. **Filecoin:** One of the most notable projects to use a SAFT, raising $257 million in their token [sale](../s/sale.md) (
2. **Protocol Labs:** The [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) behind Filecoin, also employing the SAFT for other initiatives (

## Conclusion

The Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) represents a significant innovation in the world of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) fundraising. By addressing regulatory concerns and adapting traditional investment contracts to the unique requirements of token-based projects, it offers a pathway for compliant and flexible [capital](../c/capital.md) raising. However, it is not without its criticisms and challenges, particularly regarding who can participate in such investments and how regulatory bodies interpret these frameworks. As the regulatory landscape evolves, the effectiveness and adoption of the SAFT may also change, influencing the future of token-based fundraising.
