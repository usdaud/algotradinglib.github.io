# Statistics

Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It is a crucial component in a wide array of fields including [finance](../f/finance.md), [economics](../e/economics.md), engineering, medicine, [social sciences](../s/social_sciences.md), and natural sciences. In the realm of trading and [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) and FinTech (Financial Technology), statistics play a pivotal role in driving data-based decisions, optimizing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and managing risks. This document provides a deep dive into the fundamental and advanced statistical concepts essential for professionals in these fields.

## Descriptive Statistics

[Descriptive statistics](../d/descriptive_statistics.md) involves methods for summarizing and organizing data. Descriptive methods help us understand the features of the data by providing simple summaries about the sample and measures.

### Measures of Central Tendency

Central tendency measures provide insights into the central point around which data points cluster.

1. **Mean (Arithmetic Average)**: 
   The mean is the sum of all data points divided by the number of data points. It is highly sensitive to outliers.
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
   \]

2. **[Median](../m/median.md)**:
   The [median](../m/median.md) is the middle [value](../v/value.md) of a data set when it is ordered. If the number of observations is even, the [median](../m/median.md) is the average of the two middle numbers.

3. **[Mode](../m/mode.md)**: 
   The [mode](../m/mode.md) is the most frequently occurring [value](../v/value.md) in a data set.

### Measures of Dispersion

[Dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) measures [offer](../o/offer.md) insights into the spread or [variability](../v/variability.md) of the data.

1. **[Range](../r/range.md)**: 
   The [range](../r/range.md) is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set.
   \[
   \text{[Range](../r/range.md)} = \max(x_i) - \min(x_i)
   \]

2. **Variance**:
   Variance measures the average degree to which each point differs from the mean.
   \[
   \text{Variance} (\sigma^2) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}
   \]

3. **[Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)**:
   The [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the amount of variation or [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) in a set of values.
   \[
   \text{[Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)} (\sigma) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}
   \]
    
4. **Interquartile [Range](../r/range.md) (IQR)**:
   The IQR measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data and is the difference between the first [quartile](../q/quartile.md) (Q1) and the third [quartile](../q/quartile.md) (Q3).
   \[
   \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
   \]

### Skewness and Kurtosis

These measures describe the shape of the data [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

1. **[Skewness](../s/skewness.md)**: 
   [Skewness](../s/skewness.md) quantifies how asymmetrical the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of data is around the mean. Positive skew indicates a [distribution](../d/distribution.md) with a long right tail, while negative skew indicates a long left tail.
   \[
   \text{[Skewness](../s/skewness.md)} = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sigma} \right)^3
   \]

2. **[Kurtosis](../k/kurtosis.md)**:
   [Kurtosis](../k/kurtosis.md) measures the "peakedness" of the [distribution](../d/distribution.md). High [kurtosis](../k/kurtosis.md) means more of the variance is due to infrequent extreme deviations.
   \[
   \text{[Kurtosis](../k/kurtosis.md)} = \frac{n(n+1)}{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sigma} \right)^4 - \frac{3(n-1)^2}{(n-2)(n-3)}
   \]

## Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics allow us to make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. This involves using [probability theory](../p/probability_theory_in_trading.md) to measure the outcomes of hypotheses and determine the reliability of conclusions.

### Probability Distributions

1. **[Normal Distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md)**:
   The [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md), also known as [Gaussian distribution](../g/gaussian_distribution.md), is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetrical around the mean. Many financial models assume that returns are normally distributed.
   \[
   f(x|\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{ -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} }
   \]

2. **[Binomial Distribution](../b/binomial_distribution.md)**:
   The [binomial distribution](../b/binomial_distribution.md) models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
   \[
   P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
   \]

3. **[Poisson Distribution](../p/poisson_distribution_in_trading.md)**:
   The [Poisson distribution](../p/poisson_distribution_in_trading.md) models the number of events occurring within a given interval of time or space.
   \[
   P(X = k) = \frac{\[lambda](../l/lambda.md)^k e^{-\[lambda](../l/lambda.md)}}{k!}
   \]

4. **[Log-Normal Distribution](../l/log-normal_distribution.md)**:
   In [finance](../f/finance.md), [asset](../a/asset.md) prices are often modeled as log-normally distributed, which implies that the logarithm of the [asset](../a/asset.md) price is normally distributed.

### Hypothesis Testing

[Hypothesis testing](../h/hypothesis_testing.md) involves making assumptions (hypotheses) about a population parameter and using sample data to test those assumptions.

1. **[Null Hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md) (H0)**:
   A statement of no effect or no difference, which we seek to test.

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**:
   A statement that indicates the presence of an effect or a difference.

3. **Test Statistics**:
   Calculated statistics that are compared to a threshold [value](../v/value.md) to determine whether to reject the [null hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md).

4. **p-[Value](../v/value.md)**:
   The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the [null hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md) is correct.

### Confidence Intervals

[Confidence intervals](../c/confidence_intervals.md) provide a [range](../r/range.md) of values which is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%).

\[
\text{[Confidence Interval](../c/confidence_interval.md)} = \bar{x} \pm Z_{\frac{\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)}{2}} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
\]

Where \( \bar{x} \) is the sample mean, \( Z_{\frac{\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)}{2}} \) is the critical [value](../v/value.md) from the standard [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md), \( \sigma \) is the population [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md), and \( n \) is the sample size.

### Regression Analysis

[Regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) examines the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

1. **[Linear Regression](../l/linear_regression.md)**:
   \[
   y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
   \]
   Where \( y \) is the dependent variable, \( x \) is the independent variable, \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept, \( \beta_1 \) is the slope, and \( \epsilon \) is the [error term](../e/error_term.md).

2. **[Multiple](../m/multiple.md) Regression**:
   \[
   y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon
   \]

### Time Series Analysis

[Time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md) involves analyzing data that are collected over time to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and other time-dependent structures.

1. **[Autocorrelation](../a/autocorrelation.md)**:
   Measures the similarity between current data points and their past values.
   \[
   \[rho](../r/rho.md)(k) = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n-k} (x_t - \mu)(x_{t+k} - \mu)}{\sum_{t=1}^{n} (x_t - \mu)^2}
   \]

2. **Moving Averages**:
   Smoothing techniques to investigate trends in the data.

3. **ARIMA Models**:
   AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models are used to predict future points in a [time series](../t/time_series.md) by considering past values and past forecast errors.
   \[
   ARIMA(p, d, q)
   \]
   Where \( p \) is the [order](../o/order.md) of the autoregressive part, \( d \) is the degree of differencing, and \( q \) is the [order](../o/order.md) of the moving average part.

## Applications in Trading and Finance

   Measures the potential loss in [value](../v/value.md) of a portfolio over a defined period for a given [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md).
   \[
   \text{VaR}_{\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)} = \inf \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : P(Loss > x) \leq \[alpha](../a/alpha.md) \}
   \]

2. **Expected [Shortfall](../s/shortfall.md) (ES)**:
   The [expected value](../e/expected_value.md) of losses given that the loss is beyond the VaR threshold.

   \[
   \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{E(R_p) - R_f}{\sigma_p}
   \]
   Where \( E(R_p) \) is the expected portfolio [return](../r/return.md), \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate, and \( \sigma_p \) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the portfolio’s [excess return](../e/excess_return.md).
