# Swiss Exchange (SIX)

The Swiss [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), commonly known as SIX, is a pivotal financial hub that plays an integral role in the global financial [market](../m/market.md). Based in Zurich, Switzerland, the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) is renowned for its [robust](../r/robust.md) technological [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), extensive [range](../r/range.md) of financial products, and resilient regulatory framework. This article delves into the multifaceted nature of SIX, exploring its historical evolution, functional mechanisms, listing criteria, regulatory environment, and its contemporary relevance in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md).

## Historical Evolution

SIX traces its origins to the mid-nineteenth century when Switzerland's first stock exchanges were established in different cities, including the Geneva Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (1856), the Zurich Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (1873), and the Basel Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (1876). These regional exchanges thrived independently until the late 1980s and early 1990s when the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) underwent significant [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) and technological advancement. In 1995, a pivotal transformation occurred with the [merger](../m/merger.md) of the regional exchanges into a single entity, known as the SWX Swiss [Exchange](../e/exchange.md). This [merger](../m/merger.md) aimed to streamline trading processes, enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and integrate Switzerland’s [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

The SWX Swiss [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was further revolutionized in 2008 with the establishment of the SIX Group. This move integrated the Swiss [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) with other financial services, including [clearing](../c/clearing.md), settlement, and information services, creating a comprehensive financial ecosystem. As a result, the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) was rebranded as SIX Swiss [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), signifying its expanded [scope](../s/scope.md) and strategic alignment with technological innovation.

## Functional Mechanisms

### Trading Platform

SIX Swiss [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) operates a highly sophisticated electronic [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) known as "SWXess." Launched in 2009, SWXess leverages state-of-the-art technology to facilitate efficient, transparent, and secure trading of financial instruments. The platform supports a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including equities, bonds, [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs), structured products, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

#### Market Phases

The trading day on SIX is divided into several [market](../m/market.md) phases:

1. **Pre-Opening Phase:** During this phase, [market](../m/market.md) participants can input and modify orders, but no transactions are executed. This phase is critical for setting the opening prices.
   
2. **Opening Auction:** This phase determines the opening prices based on the [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) of [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md). It ensures a fair and orderly start to the trading day.
   
3. **Continuous Trading:** This is the main trading phase where buy and sell orders are matched continuously throughout the day. It employs a price-time priority mechanism, ensuring that the best available prices are executed first.
   
4. **Closing Auction:** Similar to the opening auction, this phase determines the closing prices of the traded instruments.
   
5. **Post-Trading Phase:** This phase allows participants to enter orders for the next trading day and make necessary adjustments.
