# Stop-Limit Order

A stop-[limit order](../l/limit_order.md) is a combination of two types of orders, designed to mitigate some of the risks associated with trading in volatile markets by incorporating conditions that must be met before an [order](../o/order.md) is executed. This type of [order](../o/order.md) combines the features of a [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) and a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md), providing traders with increased control over the prices at which their orders are executed.

When a stop-[limit order](../l/limit_order.md) is placed, it specifies both a stop price and a limit price. Once the stop price is triggered, the [order](../o/order.md) becomes a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) to buy or sell at the limit price or better. This ensures that [stocks](../s/stock.md) are not bought or sold at prices that are worse than the limit price specified.

## Components of a Stop-Limit Order

### 1. Stop Price
The stop price acts as a trigger for the [order](../o/order.md). When the [market price](../m/market_price.md) reaches or surpasses the stop price, the stop-[limit order](../l/limit_order.md) is activated. It is important to [note](../n/note.md) that reaching the stop price does not guarantee an [execution](../e/execution.md); it merely turns the stop-[limit order](../l/limit_order.md) into a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md).

### 2. Limit Price
The limit price defines the highest (for buy orders) or lowest (for sell orders) price at which the [order](../o/order.md) can be executed, once the stop price has been triggered. The limit price helps to protect traders from unfavorable executions but also introduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [order](../o/order.md) may not be filled if the [market price](../m/market_price.md) moves beyond the limit price.

## Example of a Stop-Limit Order

Consider a [trader](../t/trader.md) who owns [shares](../s/shares.md) of a company currently trading at $50 per share. The [trader](../t/trader.md) wants to sell these [shares](../s/shares.md) if the price drops to $45 but wants to ensure that they are not sold for less than $44. The [trader](../t/trader.md) would place a sell stop-[limit order](../l/limit_order.md) with a stop price of $45 and a limit price of $44.

- If the [market price](../m/market_price.md) drops to $45, the [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) activates, turning the [order](../o/order.md) into a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) to sell at $44.
- If the price falls to $45 but then quickly plunges to $43 without touching $44, the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be executed because the specified limit price condition is not met.

## Advantages of Stop-Limit Orders

### 1. Price Control
[Stop-limit orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md) provide traders with the certainty that their trades [will](../w/will.md) not be executed at prices worse than the limit price. This is particularly useful in volatile markets where price swings can occur quickly.

### 2. Risk Management
By setting both a stop price and a limit price, traders can more effectively manage their [risk](../r/risk.md). They can avoid drastic losses while also ensuring that they are not forced to accept prices that are unfavorable.

### 3. Flexibility
Traders can use [stop-limit orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md) in a variety of ways, depending on their [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md). For instance:
- **Protective [Stop-Limit Orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md):** Used to protect profits on existing positions.
- **Entry [Stop-Limit Orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md):** Used to enter positions at favorable prices when certain [market](../m/market.md) conditions are met.

## Disadvantages of Stop-Limit Orders

### 1. No Guaranteed Execution
The primary drawback of a stop-[limit order](../l/limit_order.md) is that there is no guarantee the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) be executed if the limit price is not reached or if the [market](../m/market.md) moves too quickly. This can result in missed trading opportunities or continued exposure to unwanted [risk](../r/risk.md).

### 2. Complexity
[Stop-limit orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md) are more complex than simple [market](../m/market.md) or limit orders. Traders need to understand both the stop and limit components and how they interact within the [market](../m/market.md).

### 3. Potential for Partial Fills
Depending on the [market](../m/market.md) conditions and the size of the [order](../o/order.md), a stop-[limit order](../l/limit_order.md) may be partially filled, leaving the [trader](../t/trader.md) with an incomplete position at the limit price.

## How to Place a Stop-Limit Order

Placing a stop-[limit order](../l/limit_order.md) can vary slightly depending on the brokerage platform being used. However, the general steps are as follows:

### 1. Select Order Type
Initiate the placement of an [order](../o/order.md) and select "Stop-Limit" as the [order](../o/order.md) type.

### 2. Set Stop Price
Enter the stop price, at which the [order](../o/order.md) is triggered.

### 3. Set Limit Price
Enter the limit price, at which you are willing to buy or sell the [security](../s/security.md).

### 4. Confirm Order Details
Review all the details to ensure they are correct, including the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) (or contracts) and the [duration](../d/duration.md) of the [order](../o/order.md) (day, good-til-canceled, etc.)

### 5. Submit Order
Submit the [order](../o/order.md). Monitor the [order](../o/order.md) to ensure it is executed according to your trading plan.

## Best Practices for Using Stop-Limit Orders

### 1. Monitor Market Conditions
Be mindful of current [market](../m/market.md) conditions. In highly volatile markets, the spread between the stop price and the limit price should be wider to increase the potential for [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md).

### 2. Use in Conjunction with Other Strategies
Incorporate [stop-limit orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md) as part of a broader [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md). This may include using [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to determine optimal stop and limit prices.

### 3. Adjust Orders Regularly
Reassess and adjust your [stop-limit orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md) as [market](../m/market.md) conditions and your trading objectives change.

## Conclusion

[Stop-limit orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md) are a valuable tool for traders looking to manage their [risk](../r/risk.md) and have greater control over the [execution](../e/execution.md) of their trades. By understanding the mechanics and nuances of [stop-limit orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md), traders can employ these orders effectively within their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). However, it is important to be aware of the associated risks and ensure that [stop-limit orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md) are placed correctly to avoid unexpected outcomes.

For additional [guidance](../g/guidance.md) and practical implementation details, traders can refer to resources provided by their brokerage platforms such as which [offer](../o/offer.md) comprehensive guides and [customer](../c/customer.md) support on the usage of [stop-limit orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md).
