# Specialist

A specialist is a market professional who maintains fair and orderly trading in certain securities on an exchange. Specialists historically operated on floor based exchanges, though many roles have shifted to electronic market makers.

## Responsibilities
- Provide liquidity by posting bids and offers.
- Manage order imbalances at the open and close.
- Maintain orderly markets during volatility.

## Example
A specialist steps in with buy orders during a temporary sell imbalance to stabilize trading until natural buyers return.

## Practical notes
The traditional specialist role has evolved, but designated market makers on some exchanges serve similar functions.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Specialist and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Specialist as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Specialist, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Specialist. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Specialist alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
