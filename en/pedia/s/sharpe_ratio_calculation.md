# Sharpe Ratio Calculation

The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), named after Nobel laureate [William F. Sharpe](../w/william_f._sharpe.md), is a measure that helps investors and portfolio managers understand the [return](../r/return.md) of an investment compared to its [risk](../r/risk.md). It serves to analyze the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) or to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) the performance of different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes or investment strategies.

## Definition

Mathematically, the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) is defined as:

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{E[R_p - R_f]}{\sigma_p} \]

Where:
- \( E[R_p - R_f] \) is the expected [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) of the portfolio over the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.
- \( \sigma_p \) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the portfolio's [excess return](../e/excess_return.md), which measures the investment's [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Components of the Sharpe Ratio

### Expected Portfolio Return (\(E[R_p]\))

The [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the portfolio (\(E[R_p]\)) represents the [average return](../a/average_return.md) the portfolio is anticipated to generate over a specific period.

### Risk-Free Rate (\(R_f\))

The [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate (\(R_f\)) is often proxied by the [return](../r/return.md) on short-term government securities, such as [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bills. It represents the [return](../r/return.md) expected from an investment with zero [risk](../r/risk.md), serving as a [baseline](../b/baseline.md) for measuring [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted performance.

### Excess Return (\( E[R_p - R_f] \))

The [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) is the difference between the expected portfolio [return](../r/return.md) and the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate. It represents additional returns generated over an investment period after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.

### Standard Deviation of Portfolio's Excess Return (\( \sigma_p \))

The [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of a portfolio’s [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) (\( \sigma_p \)) quantifies the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the returns. A higher [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) indicates greater [risk](../r/risk.md) as the returns fluctuate widely from the mean [return](../r/return.md).

## Steps to Calculate the Sharpe Ratio

### 1. Calculate the Average Periodic Return

Determine the [average return](../a/average_return.md) of the portfolio over a set period. For instance, if calculating monthly returns over a year, sum the monthly returns and divide by 12.

\[ \text{[Average Return](../a/average_return.md)} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} R_{p,i} \]

Where:
- \( N \) is the number of periods.
- \( R_{p,i} \) is the [return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio in period \( i \).

### 2. Determine the Risk-Free Rate

Identify the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate applicable to the period of investment. If using monthly data, ensure the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate is also expressed on a monthly [basis](../b/basis.md).

### 3. Compute the Excess Return per Period

Subtract the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate from the periodic returns to calculate the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) for each period.

\[ \text{[Excess Return](../e/excess_return.md)}_{i} = R_{p,i} - R_f \]

### 4. Compute the Average Excess Return

Calculate the average [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) over all periods.

\[ \text{Average [Excess Return](../e/excess_return.md)} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (R_{p,i} - R_f) \]

### 5. Calculate the Standard Deviation of Excess Returns

Determine the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the excess returns across the periods.

\[ \sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} [(R_{p,i} - R_f) - \text{Average [Excess Return](../e/excess_return.md)}]^2}{N - 1}} \]

### 6. Compute the Sharpe Ratio

Divide the average [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) by the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of excess returns.

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Average [Excess Return](../e/excess_return.md)}}{\sigma_p} \]

## Practical Application Example

### Portfolio X Analysis
- Suppose Portfolio X has monthly returns for one year as follows: 1.2%, 0.8%, 1.5%, -0.5%, etc.
- The [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate (annualized) is 2%, which translates to a monthly rate of approximately 0.1667%.

First, calculate the average monthly [return](../r/return.md) of Portfolio X. Assume the summation of these returns divided by 12 yields an [average return](../a/average_return.md) of 0.9%.

Next, compute the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) by subtracting the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate from each monthly [return](../r/return.md). For example:
- January: 1.2% - 0.1667% = 1.0333%
- February: 0.8% - 0.1667% = 0.6333%
- Continue for each month.

Calculate the average [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) from these values, let’s assume it’s 0.7333%, and then determine the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) for these excess returns. Suppose the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) comes out to 0.6%.

Finally, compute the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md):

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{0.7333\%}{0.6\%} = 1.222 \]

A [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) of 1.222 indicates that Portfolio X provides 1.222 units of extra [return](../r/return.md) per unit of [risk](../r/risk.md), suggesting that the [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md) is generating excellent returns for the assumed level of [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Sharpe Ratio in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), system inefficiencies are captured by algorithms that execute trades to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on slight price differences. Effective algorithms should aim for a high [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) by achieving significant returns with minimal [risk](../r/risk.md). This is often done using techniques such as:
- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md):** Calculating Sharpe Ratios on historical data to gauge expected performance.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Adjusting position sizes, stop losses, and other [risk](../r/risk.md) parameters to minimize portfolio [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Limitations of Sharpe Ratio

### Assumption of Normally Distributed Returns

The calculation presumes [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) of returns, which isn’t always true. Asymmetrical [return](../r/return.md) distributions affect the reliability of the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md).

### Risk-Free Rate Consistency

Choosing an appropriate [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate is critical. Mismatches between the [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md) and the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free instrument’s [maturity](../m/maturity.md) can distort the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) measurement.

### Time Variation

The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) might not be consistent over different periods. A strategy yielding a high [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) in a [bull market](../b/bull_market.md) may falter in a [bear market](../b/bear_market.md) or vice versa.
