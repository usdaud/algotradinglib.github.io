# Strategic Management

Strategic management is the continuous planning, monitoring, analysis, and assessment of all that is necessary for an organization to meet its goals and objectives. Changes in [business](../b/business.md) environments [will](../w/will.md) require organizations to constantly assess their strategies for success. Strategic management helps corporations navigate complex environments and can improve overall organizational performance.

Strategic management encompasses several stages and methodologies, which we [will](../w/will.md) delve into more comprehensively below.

## Components of Strategic Management

### 1. Strategic Vision and Mission

A strategic vision articulates the long-term direction an organization wants to pursue. It's often aspirational and forward-thinking, providing a clear sense of purpose. The mission statement, on the other hand, defines the organization's [business](../b/business.md), its objectives, and its approach to reach those objectives. Both are critical for guiding strategic decision-making.

### 2. Environmental Scanning

Environmental scanning involves studying and interpreting [business](../b/business.md) trends, [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md), and external factors that could impact the organization. It includes:
- **PESTEL Analysis** (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal factors).
- **SWOT Analysis** (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).

### 3. Strategy Formulation

This involves crafting strategies based on the insights gained from environmental scanning. Organizations often employ frameworks such as:
- **Porter's Five Forces**: Assesses [industry](../i/industry.md) competitiveness.
- **BCG Matrix**: Helps in [portfolio management](../p/par.md) by categorizing [business](../b/business.md) units/products based on [market](../m/market.md) growth and [market share](../m/market_share.md).
- **Ansoff Matrix**: Guides decisions related to [market penetration](../m/market_penetration.md), product development, [market](../m/market.md) development, and [diversification](../d/diversification.md).

### 4. Strategy Implementation

Transforming strategic plans into actions involves:
- **Resource Allocation**: Ensuring efficient deployment of both tangible and intangible resources.
- **[Organizational Structure](../o/organizational_structure.md)**: Adapting the hierarchy and structure to better align with strategic goals.
- **Change Management**: Managing personnel and cultural shifts to integrate the strategy.

### 5. Evaluation and Control

This involves monitoring performance, comparing it against benchmarks, and making necessary adjustments. Key tools and metrics include:
- **Balanced Scorecard**: Managing performance and strategy [execution](../e/execution.md).
- **KPIs (Key [Performance Indicators](../p/performance_indicators.md))**: Specific metrics to track operational success.
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing processes and [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) to [best practices](../b/best_practices.md).

## Competitive Strategies

Competitive strategies are essential in defining how an organization [will](../w/will.md) differentiate itself in the [market](../m/market.md):
- **Cost [Leadership](../l/leadership.md)**: Becoming the lowest-cost producer in the [industry](../i/industry.md).
- **Differentiation**: [Offering](../o/offering.md) unique products/services that justify a [premium](../p/premium.md) price.
- **Focus Strategy**: Concentrating on a niche [market](../m/market.md) to [gain](../g/gain.md) a [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md).

Firms often deploy hybrid strategies that combine elements to optimize for both cost and differentiation.

## Strategic Management in Technology-Driven Environments

In rapidly evolving sectors like fintech or algo-trading, agility in strategic management becomes paramount:
- **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/accountability.md)**: Requires an adaptive strategy to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [market](../m/market.md) data for automated trades. Platforms like **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)** (https://www.[quantconnect](../q/quantconnect.md).com/) enable traders to backtest strategies using historical data.
- **Fintech Innovations**: Disruptive technologies necessitate a flexible strategy. Companies like **Stripe** (https://stripe.com/) continually adapt their [business models](../b/business_models.md) to [offer](../o/offer.md) advanced [payment](../p/payment.md) processing solutions.

## Globalization and Strategic Management

The global nature of modern [business](../b/business.md) adds layers of complexity:
- **Global Strategy**: Balancing standardization and localization to cater to different markets.
- **International [Expansion](../e/expansion.md)**: Entry strategies such as [joint](../j/joint.md) ventures, strategic alliances, and wholly-owned subsidiaries.
