# Stock Volatility

Stock volatility measures the variability of a stock's returns over time. Higher volatility means larger price swings and greater uncertainty.

## Measures
- Historical volatility based on past returns.
- Implied volatility derived from option prices.
- Realized volatility over a rolling window.

## Example
A stock with a 30 percent annualized volatility typically experiences larger price swings than one with 10 percent volatility.

## Practical notes
Volatility affects position sizing, option pricing, and risk limits. It tends to rise during market stress.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Stock Volatility and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Stock Volatility as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Stock Volatility, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Stock Volatility. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Stock Volatility alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
