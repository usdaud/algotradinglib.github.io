# Systematic Trading

Systematic trading, also known as [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) or algo trading, refers to a method of trading financial instruments based on pre-determined and automated [trading rules](../t/trading_rules.md). These rules are defined using [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md), statistical methods, and algorithmic strategies that determine the initiation, [execution](../e/execution.md), and exit of trades without human intervention. Below, we'll delve into a detailed exploration of the concepts, strategies, technologies, and companies involved in systematic trading.

## What is Systematic Trading?

Systematic trading leverages [computational algorithms](../c/computational_algorithms.md) to execute trades based on historical data and [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md). Unlike [discretionary trading](../d/discretionary_trading.md), which relies on the intuition and decisions of individual traders, systematic trading automates decision-making processes, aiming to increase [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and reduce the emotional impact on trading activities.

## Key Components of Systematic Trading

### 1. **Quantitative Models**

[Quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) form the backbone of systematic [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). These models use mathematical techniques to predict price movements and other financial [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). Common quantitative techniques include:

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Identifying pricing inefficiencies between related financial instruments.
- **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md):** Betting that prices [will](../w/will.md) [return](../r/return.md) to their historical averages.
- **[Momentum](../m/momentum.md) Strategies:** Capitalizing on continuations in [market price](../m/market_price.md) trends.

### 2. **Algorithmic Strategies**

Some popular [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies include:

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Making:** Providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by simultaneously entering buy and sell orders.
- **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md):** Identifying and following long-term [market](../m/market.md) trends.
- **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Exploiting price differences in identical or similar financial instruments across different markets or platforms.
- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Engaging in [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) strategies to exploit small pricing inefficiencies.

### 3. **Backtesting**

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) involves testing the [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) on historical data to evaluate their performance. This helps to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models before deploying them in live trading environments.

### 4. **Execution Algorithms**

[Execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md) are designed to minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact and reduce [trading costs](../t/trading_costs.md). Examples include:

- **TWAP (Time-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price):** Splits orders into smaller parts executed over a predefined time period.
- **VWAP ([Volume](../v/volume.md)-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price):** Executes orders based on historical [volume patterns](../v/volume_patterns.md).
- **Iceberg Orders:** Breaks large orders into smaller visible portions to hide the actual [order](../o/order.md) size.

### 5. **Risk Management**

Systematic strategies incorporate predefined [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) rules to mitigate potential losses. These may include [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) rules, and [diversification strategies](../d/diversification_strategies.md).

## Technologies in Systematic Trading

### 1. **Data Acquisition and Processing**

Data is pivotal for systematic trading. This includes historical price data, [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md), [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), news sentiment, and more. Providers like [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), [Reuters](../r/reuters.md), and [QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) comprehensive data feeds.

### 2. **Programming Languages**

Programming languages such as Python, R, C++, and MATLAB are widely used to develop, backtest, and implement [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Pythonâ€™s rich libraries like NumPy, pandas, and [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md) make it particularly popular among quants.

### 3. **Trading Platforms**

Various trading platforms support the deployment of systematic [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), including:

- **MetaTrader 4/5:** Popular for forex trading.
- **[MultiCharts](../m/multicharts.md):** Supports various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and provides extensive charting tools.
- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md):** Offers a [robust](../r/robust.md) API for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

### 4. **Machine Learning and AI**

[Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) (ML) and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) (AI) are increasingly being integrated into systematic trading to enhance model accuracy and predictability. Techniques like [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md), [reinforcement learning](../r/reinforcement_learning.md), and [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) are applied to extract insights from large data sets.
