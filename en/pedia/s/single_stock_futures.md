# Single Stock Futures

Single stock futures are futures contracts based on an individual stock rather than an index or commodity. They provide leveraged exposure and can be used for hedging or speculation.

## Features
- Standardized contract size and expiration dates.
- Margin requirements lower than buying the stock outright.
- Cash settlement or physical delivery depending on the market.

## Example
A trader buys a single stock future on a company trading at 50. The contract controls 100 shares, so a 1 point move equals 100 in profit or loss.

## Practical notes
Single stock futures can have limited liquidity compared to equity options or the underlying stock. Traders should monitor volume and spreads.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Single Stock Futures and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Single Stock Futures as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Single Stock Futures, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Single Stock Futures. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Single Stock Futures alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
