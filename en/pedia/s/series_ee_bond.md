# Series EE Bond

Series EE Bonds, often referred to simply as EE Bonds, are a type of U.S. government savings [bond](../b/bond.md) that [offer](../o/offer.md) a low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investment option. These bonds are a form of [debt](../d/debt.md) issued by the Treasury Department and are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government. They serve as a way for citizens to save [money](../m/money.md) while earning [interest](../i/interest.md) over a fixed period. Unlike [marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) like Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, Series EE Bonds are non-marketable, meaning they cannot be resold on secondary markets. This makes them uniquely designed for individual investors looking for a safe, long-term savings option.

## Purchase and Eligibility

### Purchasing Options
Series EE Bonds can be purchased in electronic form. They are available in denominations as low as $25 and in any amount above that, up to $10,000 per calendar year for each [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Number. This limit is a major consideration for investors planning to use EE Bonds as a savings strategy.

### Eligibility Requirements
EE Bonds can be purchased by individual U.S. residents, U.S. citizens living abroad, or civilian employees of the U.S. government, regardless of their residence. Organizations, such as corporations, estates, and trusts, can also [hold](../h/hold.md) EE Bonds but only if they meet the IRS's criteria for a U.S. person.

## Interest Rates and Earnings

### Fixed Interest Rate
EE Bonds issued after May 2005 have a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) determined at the time of purchase. This rate is set by the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) and typically announced twice a year, in May and November. The fixed rate holds for the life of the [bond](../b/bond.md) unless a special case such as reissuing occurs.

### Minimum Investment Term
The minimum term of ownership before cashing in an EE [Bond](../b/bond.md) is one year. If you redeem the [bond](../b/bond.md) before five years, you'll forfeit the last three months of [interest](../i/interest.md), akin to an early [withdrawal penalty](../w/withdrawal_penalty.md). This encourages long-term holding but provides some flexibility for those who need access to their funds sooner.

### Interest Compounding and Tax Benefits
[Interest](../i/interest.md) on an EE [Bond](../b/bond.md) compounds semi-annually and is exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). [Federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax on the [interest](../i/interest.md) earned can be deferred until the [bond](../b/bond.md) is redeemed or it matures, whichever comes first. Additionally, bonds used to pay for qualified higher education expenses may be excluded from [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax under certain conditions.

## Maturity and Redemption

### Initial Maturity and Extended Terms
EE Bonds mature after 20 years were guaranteed to double in [value](../v/value.md) if held for that long. Even though they mature in 20 years, they [will](../w/will.md) continue to earn [interest](../i/interest.md) for up to 30 years from the [issue](../i/issue.md) date. After that, the bonds stop earning [interest](../i/interest.md), and it is advisable to redeem them.

### Redemption Procedures
To redeem an EE [Bond](../b/bond.md), you would log into your TreasuryDirect account, or if you have paper bonds, you could visit a financial institution that cashes savings bonds. The [redemption](../r/redemption.md) [value](../v/value.md) of a [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) include both the [principal](../p/principal.md) and the [accrued interest](../a/accrued_interest.md), and the Treasury provides an online calculator to estimate this [value](../v/value.md).

## Uses of Series EE Bonds

### Education Savings
One of the unique benefits of EE Bonds is their use for education savings. Under the Education Savings [Bond](../b/bond.md) Program, the [interest](../i/interest.md) earned may be tax-exempt if the proceeds are used to pay for qualified higher education expenses at an eligible institution. This makes EE Bonds particularly attractive to parents or grandparents who wish to invest in a family member's future educational needs.

### Retirement Planning
While not as popular as other retirement savings vehicles, EE Bonds can also be used as a conservative component of a retirement portfolio. Their guaranteed [return](../r/return.md) and safety make them an option for those nearing retirement who want to preserve [capital](../c/capital.md) with a reliable [interest](../i/interest.md) accrual.

### Gifting
EE Bonds can be gifted to others, making them a useful tool for financial gifting. The process of gifting an EE [Bond](../b/bond.md) is relatively simple on TreasuryDirect and requires the recipient's [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Number and TreasuryDirect account information. Gift bonds can be especially practical for children as a way to instill the [value](../v/value.md) of saving and provide a [nest egg](../n/nest_egg.md) for future needs.

## Historical Context

### Evolution of Savings Bonds
Series EE Bonds were initiated in 1980, replacing Series E Bonds, which had been available since the 1940s. Over the years, changes in [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) structures and purchase methods have evolved, reflecting the broader economic environment and advances in technology.

The initial motivation behind the creation of savings bonds was to provide a simple, accessible savings instrument for American citizens and to [finance](../f/finance.md) government expenditures during times of war. Today, they continue to serve as a stable financial product, supported by their strong federal backing.

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages
1. **Safety**: EE Bonds are [risk](../r/risk.md)-free as they are backed by the U.S. government.
2. **Tax Benefits**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) is exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and can be [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) or used [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) for education expenses.
3. **Predictable Returns**: For those held for 20 years, the guaranteed doubling provides a known [return](../r/return.md).
4. **Simplicity**: Easy to purchase and manage through TreasuryDirect.

### Disadvantages
1. **Moderate Returns**: The [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) may be lower compared to more volatile investment [options](../o/options.md).
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Restrictions**: Early [redemption](../r/redemption.md) penalties if bonds are cashed before five years.
3. **Purchase Limitations**: A $10,000 annual purchase limit may restrict investment for those looking to save larger sums.

In conclusion, Series EE Bonds provide a secure, straightforward means of saving and [investing](../i/investing.md) with specific benefits related to education and tax savings. While they might [offer](../o/offer.md) moderate returns compared to equities or other higher-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments, their guaranteed [interest](../i/interest.md) and backed [security](../s/security.md) make them a reliable choice for conservative savers.
