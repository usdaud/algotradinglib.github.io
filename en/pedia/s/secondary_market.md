# Secondary Market

## Definition and Importance

The secondary [market](../m/market.md) is a financial [market](../m/market.md) where previously issued securities such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [options](../o/options.md), and [futures](../f/futures.md) are bought and sold. Unlike the [primary market](../p/primary_market.md), where securities are created and sold directly to investors, the secondary [market](../m/market.md) allows investors to [trade](../t/trade.md) securities among themselves. This [market](../m/market.md) is crucial for the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), enabling investors to buy or sell instruments easily and quickly.

## Types of Secondary Markets

### Stock Exchanges
These are centralized platforms where securities are [listed](../l/listed.md) and traded. Major stock exchanges include:
- **New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE)**: One of the largest and oldest stock exchanges in the world. (Website: [NYSE](https://www.nyse.com))
- **[NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)**: Known for its electronic trading system and being [home](../h/home.md) to many tech companies. (Website: [NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com))

- **OTC Markets Group**: Hosts trading for many small and micro-cap companies. (Website: [OTC Markets](https://www.otcmarkets.com))
  
### Dealer Markets
In these markets, dealers [hold](../h/hold.md) inventories of certain securities and buy/sell for their own account. Examples include:
- **[Bond](../b/bond.md) Markets**: Where dealers facilitate the buying and selling of bonds.
- **[Foreign Exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) Markets (Forex)**: Decentralized markets where currencies are traded. (Website: [Forex](https://www.forex.com))
  
### Auction Markets
These are markets where buyers and sellers congregate at a single venue (physical or electronic) and submit bids and offers through [open outcry](../o/open_outcry.md) or a comparable process. An example is the Treasury auction process for government securities.

## Key Features of Secondary Markets
