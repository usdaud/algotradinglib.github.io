# Support and Resistance

## Introduction to Support and Resistance
Support and resistance are fundamental concepts in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). They represent specific price levels on charts that tend to act as barriers, preventing the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) from moving in a certain direction.

Support is a [price level](../p/price_level.md) where a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) can be expected to pause due to a concentration of [demand](../d/demand.md) or buying [interest](../i/interest.md). As the price of assets drops, [demand](../d/demand.md) increases, thus forming the support line. Conversely, resistance is a [price level](../p/price_level.md) where a [trend](../t/trend.md) can pause or reverse as a concentration of selling [interest](../i/interest.md) emerges. When the price of assets rises, selling [interest](../i/interest.md) increases, thus forming the resistance line.

In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), support and resistance levels can be used to develop [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and enhance [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md). Algorithmic traders [leverage](../l/leverage.md) these levels to automate buying and selling actions, creating rules-based strategies that recognize and act upon these critical price thresholds.

## Identification of Support and Resistance Levels
### Historical Price Analysis
One of the primary methods for identifying support and resistance levels is through [historical price analysis](../h/historical_price_analysis.md). By examining past price movements, traders can determine key levels where the price has historically struggled to move above (resistance) or below (support). These levels are likely to be significant in the future as well.

### Moving Averages
Moving averages are often utilized to identify support and resistance levels. This involves plotting the average price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) over a specific period, which can smooth out price data to observe trends. Commonly used moving averages include the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. When the price approaches these levels, they can serve as dynamic support or resistance.

### Trendlines
Trendlines are straight lines drawn on a chart that connects a series of price points, typically highs or lows. A rising [trendline](../t/trendline.md) can act as support, while a falling [trendline](../t/trendline.md) can act as resistance. Trendlines help in identifying the direction and strength of a [trend](../t/trend.md), and they can provide vital insights into future price movements.

### Fibonacci Retracement
[Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels are also used to identify potential support and resistance levels. These levels are derived from the Fibonacci sequence and represent potential areas where the price might reverse or encounter strong support or resistance. Commonly used [retracement](../r/retracement.md) levels include 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%.

### Pivot Points
[Pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md) are calculated using the high, low, and closing prices of a previous period. They are used to predict support and resistance levels for the current trading period. [Pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md) are particularly popular in [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) and can be checkpoints for automated [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

## Application in Algorithmic Trading
### Strategy Development
Support and resistance levels can be used to develop various [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies. For instance, a [breakout](../b/breakout.md) strategy might be designed to buy an [asset](../a/asset.md) when its price breaks above a resistance level or sell when it drops below a support level. Alternatively, a [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategy might exploit the price bouncing off support or resistance levels.

### Backtesting
[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) involves testing a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) on historical data to evaluate its effectiveness. When developing strategies based on support and resistance, [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) can help determine how reliable these levels are in predicting future price movements. Traders can use [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) to refine their strategies and improve their [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md).

### Automated Execution
Using algorithms, trades can be automated to react instantly when the price reaches predetermined support or resistance levels. This removes the emotional aspect of trading and ensures that trades are executed based on logical criteria. [Automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) can continuously monitor [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets and execute trades with precision.

## Psychological Aspects
Support and resistance levels are not just technical barriers but also psychological ones. Traders' collective behavior tends to gravitate around these levels, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. For instance, many traders place [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) just below [support levels](../s/support_levels.md) or take-[profit](../p/profit.md) orders just above resistance levels, reinforcing these barriers.

## Pricing and Market Conditions
Support and resistance levels can fluctuate based on various [market](../m/market.md) conditions, including macroeconomic events, [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, or geopolitical developments. Algorithms must account for these dynamic factors to adjust their strategies accordingly.

### Volatility
[Market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can influence the strength and frequency of support and resistance levels. In highly volatile markets, these levels might be breached more often, requiring algorithms to adapt by possibly incorporating [volatility](../v/volatility.md) measures into their criteria.

## Tools and Software
### Trading Platforms
Trading platforms like MetaTrader, [NinjaTrader](../n/ninjatrader.md), and [Thinkorswim](../t/thinkorswim.md) provide tools for identifying support and resistance levels. These platforms may [offer](../o/offer.md) built-in indicators or allow for custom script programming to create personalized tools.

### API Integration
Many trading platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that algorithmic traders can use to develop custom software solutions. These APIs facilitate the integration of support and resistance identification tools directly into [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

## Notable Companies and Solutions

## Conclusion
Support and resistance are vital components of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and play a significant role in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).
