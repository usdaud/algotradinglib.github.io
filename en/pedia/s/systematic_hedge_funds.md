# Systematic Hedge Funds

Systematic [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, also known as quantitative or algo funds, are managed using computer algorithms and models to make investment decisions. These funds [leverage](../l/leverage.md) advanced mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to analyze a vast array of data and execute trades based on pre-defined criteria. Unlike traditional [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, which rely heavily on human discretion and [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), systematic [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds focus on removing human emotion and bias from the investment process. This document provides an in-depth examination of systematic [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, their strategies, key players, and the implications of their operations in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Overview of Systematic Hedge Funds

Systematic [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds operate by employing algorithmic, or rule-based, strategies that can vary from [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and [trend](../t/trend.md)-following to [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) and statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). The primary aim is to create a set of rules or models that can predict [market](../m/market.md) movements and generate profits. These strategies can be classified into short-term, medium-term, and long-term horizons, with each timeframe requiring different types of data and methods for analysis.

### Technology and Infrastructure

The core of a systematic [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) is its technological [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). This includes high-speed computers, data storage solutions, and network systems that support the rapid processing of large datasets and the [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades.

Key components:
1. **High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Systems**: These systems execute orders at extremely high speeds, often in milliseconds or microseconds.
2. **Data Repositories**: Massive amounts of historical [market](../m/market.md) data, [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), and other relevant information are stored and used for back-testing [trading models](../t/trading_models.md).
3. **[Execution Algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md)**: Tailored algorithms designed to minimize [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and [market](../m/market.md) impact during [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md).

### Data and Modeling Techniques

Systematic [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds rely on various data sources beyond conventional [market](../m/market.md) prices. This includes news sentiment, [social media](../s/social_media.md) signals, macroeconomic indicators, and more. The models employed can [range](../r/range.md) from simple moving averages to complex machine [learning algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) and [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md).

1. **Statistical Models**: These include [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md), time-series analysis, and multivariate [statistics](../s/statistics.md) to identify relationships and patterns in data.
2. **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md)**: Advanced techniques such as [supervised learning](../s/supervised_learning.md), [unsupervised learning](../u/unsupervised_learning.md), and [reinforcement learning](../r/reinforcement_learning.md) enhance predictive capabilities.
3. **[Natural Language Processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP)**: Used for analyzing text data from news or [social media](../s/social_media.md) to gauge [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).

### Strategies Employed by Systematic Hedge Funds

Systematic [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds use various strategies differing in complexity and objectives.

#### Trend Following

[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies aim to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) trends by entering positions in the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md). These strategies often use [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as moving averages and breakouts.

1. **[Moving Average Crossovers](../m/moving_average_crossovers.md)**: Entering a [trade](../t/trade.md) when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average.
2. **[Momentum Indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md)**: Utilizing indicators like the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) to identify potential entry points.
3. **Breakouts**: Buying or selling when the price breaks through a predefined level of support or resistance.

#### Mean Reversion

[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies are based on the assumption that [asset](../a/asset.md) prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical mean over time. These strategies identify securities that have deviated significantly from their average price and take opposite positions.

1. **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Profiting from pricing inefficiencies between related instruments.
2. **Pair Trading**: Trading two correlated instruments by taking long positions in the [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [security](../s/security.md) and short positions in the [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) one.
3. **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: Using the upper and lower bands to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

#### Arbitrage Strategies

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies exploit price discrepancies between related assets or markets. They often involve simultaneous buying and selling to [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md) with minimal [risk](../r/risk.md).

1. **Convertible [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Trading convertible securities against the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock.
2. **[Merger](../m/merger.md) [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Profiting from price movements before and after [merger](../m/merger.md) announcements.
3. **[Fixed Income](../f/fixed_income.md) [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Exploiting price differentials between fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities.

#### Statistical Models and AI-Based Strategies

Advanced [quantitative strategies](../q/quantitative_strategies_in_trading.md) [leverage](../l/leverage.md) statistical models and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) to predict [market](../m/market.md) movements.
