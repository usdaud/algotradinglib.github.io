# Sentiment Analysis Tools

[Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md), also known as opinion [mining](../m/mining.md), is a method used to determine whether data points towards a positive, [neutral](../n/neutral.md), or negative sentiment. This technique is incredibly powerful when applied to [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), especially in the field of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). By leveraging [sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) tools, traders can develop automated systems that parse through vast quantities of unstructured data like news articles, [social media](../s/social_media.md) feeds, and other sources of financial news to make informed trading decisions. This document provides an in-depth look into several [sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) tools and platforms that are widely used in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).
