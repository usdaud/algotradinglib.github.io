# Sentiment Indicators

In [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) are tools that investors and traders use to gauge the overall mood or sentiment of the [market](../m/market.md), which can [offer](../o/offer.md) insights into potential future [market](../m/market.md) movements. These sentiments may pertain to a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of [market](../m/market.md) participants including retail traders, institutional investors, analysts, and even media outlets. Here, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into the concept of [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md), types, how they are used in trading, and some popular [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) available today.

## What are Sentiment Indicators?

[Sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) are metrics that are designed to gauge the sentiment or attitude of [market](../m/market.md) participants regarding a particular [security](../s/security.md), sector, or the [market](../m/market.md) as a whole. They can be quantitative or qualitative, and they capture whether the [market](../m/market.md)'s attitude is predominantly bullish, bearish, or [neutral](../n/neutral.md). These indicators are particularly valuable because markets are driven not solely by fundamentals but also by human emotions and psychological factors.

[Sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) are often used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), to get a more complete picture of [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Types of Sentiment Indicators

### Bullish and Bearish Sentiment Indicators

1. **Bullish [Sentiment Indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md):** These suggest that the [market](../m/market.md) participants are optimistic about the future performance of a [security](../s/security.md) or the [market](../m/market.md). High levels of bullish sentiment can be a precursor to rising prices.
2. **Bearish [Sentiment Indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md):** These suggest that [market](../m/market.md) participants are pessimistic about the future performance of a [security](../s/security.md) or the [market](../m/market.md). High levels of bearish sentiment can precede falling prices.

### Market Breadth Indicators

[Market breadth indicators](../m/market_breadth_indicators.md) measure the degree of participation in the [market](../m/market.md)'s movements. If a large number of [stocks](../s/stock.md) are advancing, the [market](../m/market.md) is considered to have strong breadth.

### Commitment of Traders (COT) Report

1. **COT Report:** Published by the [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC), the Commitment of Traders report offers a breakdown of the positions held by commercial and non-commercial traders in the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md). It is used to gauge the sentiment of large institutional traders versus smaller individual traders.

### Put/Call Ratio

1. **Put/Call Ratio:** This ratio compares the [volume](../v/volume.md) of [put options](../p/put_options.md) to call [options](../o/options.md). A high put/call ratio can be a sign of bearish sentiment, while a low ratio can indicate bullish sentiment.

### Volatility Index (VIX)

1. **VIX:** Known as the "fear gauge," the [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) measures [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and is often inversely correlated with the [market](../m/market.md)'s performance.

### Social Media Sentiment

1. **[Social Media Sentiment](../s/social_media_sentiment.md):** Using [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) and [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md), some platforms analyze [social media](../s/social_media.md) chatter to gauge [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). For example, monitoring tweets or discussions on forums related to specific [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### Investor Surveys

1. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Surveys:** Organizations like the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) conduct weekly surveys to measure the sentiment of retail investors.

## How Sentiment Indicators Are Used in Trading

### Contrarian Strategy

One common approach is to use [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) as contrarian tools, especially when sentiment reaches extreme levels. The idea is to go against the popular sentiment when it becomes overwhelmingly bullish or bearish, under the assumption that the [market](../m/market.md) may be overextended and due for a [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

### Confirmation Tools

[Sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) can be used to confirm trends identified through technical or [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md). For example, if [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) suggests a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md) and [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) concur, the [trader](../t/trader.md) may have more confidence in initiating a long position.

### Hedging

Some traders use [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their positions. For instance, if [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) suggest an upcoming spike in [volatility](../v/volatility.md), traders might buy VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) or [options](../o/options.md) to protect their portfolios.

### Market Timing

[Sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) can help traders decide the optimal time to enter or exit the [market](../m/market.md). For example, extreme bullish sentiment in a declining [market](../m/market.md) might suggest it's time to reenter after a [pullback](../p/pullback.md).

## Examples of Popular Sentiment Indicators

### American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey

This weekly survey measures the sentiment of retail investors. It separates the results into three categories: bullish, bearish, and [neutral](../n/neutral.md). Many traders use this survey as a contrarian [indicator](../i/indicator.md) when sentiment levels reach extreme highs or lows.

### Put/Call Ratio

Extreme values in the put/call ratio can be used as a contrarian [indicator](../i/indicator.md).

### Volatility Index (VIX)

The VIX, calculated by the Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), measures the [market](../m/market.md)'s expectation of 30-day [volatility](../v/volatility.md). It is often considered a "fear gauge" since it tends to rise when the [market](../m/market.md) declines.
