# Short Borrow

Short borrow refers to the process of borrowing shares to sell short. A trader must locate and borrow shares through a broker or lending desk before executing a covered short sale.

## How it works
- The trader requests a borrow for a specific stock.
- The broker locates shares from lenders such as funds or custodians.
- The borrowed shares are delivered to the buyer when the short sale is executed.

## Costs
Borrowing carries a fee that depends on stock availability. Hard to borrow stocks have higher fees and can become unavailable quickly.

## Example
A trader wants to short a small cap stock. The broker quotes a borrow fee of 20 percent annualized due to limited supply. The trader must decide if the short is still attractive after costs.

## Practical notes
Borrow availability can change intraday. Traders should monitor locate status and borrow rates regularly.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Short Borrow and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Short Borrow as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Short Borrow, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Short Borrow. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Short Borrow alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
