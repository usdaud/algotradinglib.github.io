# Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is a type of [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) where models are trained using labeled data, allowing them to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

### Key Components
- **Labeled Data:** Input-output pairs used for training.
- **Regression and Classification:** Core tasks, where regression predicts continuous values and classification predicts discrete labels.
- **Loss Functions:** Metrics like [mean squared error](../m/mean_squared_error.md) or cross-entropy that guide training.
- **Training Algorithms:** [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) techniques such as gradient descent.

### Applications
- **Image Classification:** Recognizing objects in images.
- **Spam Detection:** Identifying unwanted emails.
- **Medical Diagnosis:** Predicting diseases from patient data.
- **[Customer](../c/customer.md) Churn Prediction:** [Forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) [customer](../c/customer.md) behavior in [business](../b/business.md).

### Advantages
- High accuracy when abundant labeled data is available.
- Well-understood methods and evaluation metrics.
- Direct mapping from inputs to outputs simplifies interpretation.

### Challenges
- Requires large amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive or time-consuming to obtain.
- Models can overfit to training data if not regularized properly.
- Performance is heavily dependent on the quality of the labels.

### Future Outlook
Future research [will](../w/will.md) focus on improving data labeling techniques (e.g., active learning) and integrating semi-supervised and unsupervised methods to reduce reliance on large labeled datasets.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Supervised Learning and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Supervised Learning as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Supervised Learning, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Supervised Learning. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Supervised Learning alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
