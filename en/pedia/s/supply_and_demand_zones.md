# Supply And Demand Zones

Supply and demand zones are chart areas where selling or buying pressure has repeatedly appeared. They are used as support and resistance zones for trade planning.

## Identification
- Supply zones form near swing highs where price reversed lower.
- Demand zones form near swing lows where price reversed higher.
- Zones are typically drawn as ranges, not single lines.

## Example
A stock reverses lower from 120 multiple times. Traders mark that area as a supply zone and look for short entries if price returns there.

## Practical notes
Zones are more reliable when aligned with higher timeframe structure and confirmed by volume or order flow.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Supply And Demand Zones and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Supply And Demand Zones as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Supply And Demand Zones, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Supply And Demand Zones. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Supply And Demand Zones alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
