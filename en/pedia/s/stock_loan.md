# Stock Loan

Stock loan is the lending of shares from one party to another, usually to support short selling or settlement needs. The borrower posts collateral and pays a fee or rebate.

## Process
- Shares are borrowed from a lender such as a fund or custodian.
- The borrower posts collateral, often cash or other securities.
- The loan can be recalled by the lender under certain conditions.

## Example
A broker borrows shares to cover client short sales. The loan fee is 5 percent annualized, which is passed on to the client.

## Practical notes
Stock loan terms vary by market. Recall risk can force short sellers to cover unexpectedly.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Stock Loan and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Stock Loan as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Stock Loan, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Stock Loan. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Stock Loan alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
