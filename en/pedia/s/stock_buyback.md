# Stock Buyback

A stock buyback is when a company repurchases its own shares from the market. Buybacks reduce shares outstanding and can increase earnings per share.

## Reasons for buybacks
- Return capital to shareholders.
- Signal confidence in the business.
- Offset dilution from stock based compensation.

## Example
A company announces a 1 billion dollar repurchase program. Over the next year it buys back shares in the open market, reducing the share count.

## Practical notes
Buybacks can support share prices but also reduce cash reserves. The timing and valuation matter for long term value.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Stock Buyback and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Stock Buyback as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Stock Buyback, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Stock Buyback. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Stock Buyback alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
