# Spread Trading

Spread trading is a type of strategy widely used in the world of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). This sophisticated trading approach involves taking simultaneous positions in two or more correlated instruments. The main objective of spread trading is to exploit the price differences between these instruments. This strategy can be employed across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes including equities, commodities, forex, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

## Understanding Spread Trading

In essence, spread trading attempts to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the relative price movements of two or more instruments. Traders simultaneously buy (go long) one instrument and sell (go short) another, hoping the price difference between the two positions [will](../w/will.md) evolve favorably. 

### Key Elements of Spread Trading

1. **[Pairs Trading](../p/pairs_trading.md)**: This is the most common form of spread trading, involving two correlated [stocks](../s/stock.md) or instruments. For example, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might go long on stock A while shorting stock B, expecting the spread between their prices to converge or diverge.
  
2. **Vertical [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Often used in [options](../o/options.md) trading, vertical [spreads](../s/spreads.md) involve buying and selling [options](../o/options.md) of the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) with the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) but at different strike prices.

3. **Horizontal [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: These involve [options](../o/options.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) but different expiration dates. Also known as calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md), they take advantage of the [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) of [options](../o/options.md).

4. **Inter-[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Involves trading between two different but related commodities. For example, trading the price difference between [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) and natural gas.

5. **Intra-[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Trading different contract months of the same [commodity](../c/commodity.md). For instance, going long on the June [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) while simultaneously shorting the December [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md).

### Benefits of Spread Trading

1. **Reduced [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Spread trading usually involves lower [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to outright positions, as the [trader](../t/trader.md) is not exposed to the entire [market](../m/market.md) movement but rather to the spread between the two positions.

2. **Lower [Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Exchanges often require lower [margin](../m/margin.md) for spread positions compared to outright positions due to their hedged nature.

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Neutrality**: Spread trading can be designed to be [market neutral](../m/market_neutral.md), meaning the strategy can [profit](../p/profit.md) regardless of the overall [market](../m/market.md) direction.

4. **Hedging**: Spreading can act as a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) for existing positions, protecting against adverse [market](../m/market.md) movements.

### Execution in Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic traders use various [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and algorithms to identify and exploit potential spread opportunities. The algorithm must continuously monitor [market](../m/market.md) conditions, correlations, and price movements to identify potential trades. 

For example, statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) models often underpin [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md) strategies, using historical price data to identify mean-reverting pairs. [Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) techniques can also be employed to enhance the effectiveness of such strategies.

### Real-World Applications and Companies

Several companies provide platforms and tools for spread trading in the [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) space:

- **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)**: A cloud-based [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platform [offering](../o/offering.md) data, research, and [execution](../e/execution.md) capabilities. Both back-testing and live trading are supported, enabling traders to deploy algorithmic spread [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) effectively.

### Spread Trading Strategies

1. **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Involves [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) the spread movements using statistical models. The [trader](../t/trader.md) looks for pairs or groups of securities whose prices have diverged from their historical [correlation](../c/correlation.md).

2. **Ratio [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Typically used with [options](../o/options.md), this strategy involves buying and selling different quantities of [options](../o/options.md) with different strike prices but the same expiry date.

3. **Butterfly [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Another [options](../o/options.md) strategy that involves a combination of [bull](../b/bull.md) and bear [spreads](../s/spreads.md), using three different strike prices, aimed at minimizing [risk](../r/risk.md) while capitalizing on minimal movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)â€™s price.

4. **[Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md)**: This is an advanced spread [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) involving four [options](../o/options.md) contracts with different strike prices to create a [range](../r/range.md) of profitability.

5. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) Pricing Theory (APT)**: An economic theory used to price assets and create [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) by leveraging differences in returns and risks across related instruments.

## Risks Involved

While spread trading can mitigate some risks, it is not without dangers:

1. **[Execution Risk](../e/execution_risk.md)**: Differences in [execution](../e/execution.md) prices can erode the [profit](../p/profit.md) potential of [spreads](../s/spreads.md), especially in volatile markets.

2. **[Model Risk](../m/model_risk.md)**: Incorrect assumptions in statistical models can lead to faulty [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md) and losses.

3. **[Leg](../l/leg.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Refers to the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with only one [leg](../l/leg.md) of a spread being executed, leaving the [trader](../t/trader.md) exposed to [market](../m/market.md) movements in the unexecuted [leg](../l/leg.md).

4. **[Correlation](../c/correlation.md) Breakdown**: If the assumed [correlation](../c/correlation.md) between spread instruments breaks down, the spread can widen or narrow unexpectedly, leading to potential losses.

### Conclusion

Spread trading offers a nuanced and sophisticated way for traders to [profit](../p/profit.md) from [market](../m/market.md) movements while managing [risk](../r/risk.md). Its multifaceted approaches can be adapted across various markets and instruments. When integrated with [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platforms, spread trading can become an effective strategy for both retail and institutional traders. However, it is crucial to understand the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) risks and complexities associated with spread trading to maximize its benefits.
