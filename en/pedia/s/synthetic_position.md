# Synthetic Position

A synthetic position is an options combination that replicates the payoff of another position, such as a stock or a forward contract. It uses options to create equivalent exposure.

## Examples
- Synthetic long stock: long call plus short put.
- Synthetic short stock: short call plus long put.
- Synthetic forward: long call plus short put at the same strike.

## Uses
- Adjusting exposure without trading the underlying.
- Managing capital or short sale constraints.
- Creating hedges with defined risk.

## Practical notes
Synthetic positions require careful management of expiration and strike selection. They can also involve assignment risk on short options.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Synthetic Position and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Synthetic Position as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Synthetic Position, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Synthetic Position. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Synthetic Position alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
