# Structural Unemployment

Structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) is a form of involuntary [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) caused by a mismatch between the skills that workers in the [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) and the skills that are in [demand](../d/demand.md). It can also arise due to geographical location disparities, where labor [supply](../s/supply.md) in one region does not meet the labor [demand](../d/demand.md) in another. This type of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) is considered more persistent and chronic compared to cyclical or [frictional unemployment](../f/frictional_unemployment.md) because it is rooted in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) shifts in the [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Causes of Structural Unemployment

### 1. Technological Changes
Advancements in technology often lead to automation and digitization, which can render certain job roles obsolete. For instance, factory workers may lose their jobs if machines can perform tasks more efficiently. 

### 2. Globalization
The [globalization](../g/globalization.md) of markets often leads to a geographical reallocation of jobs. For example, [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) jobs might move from developed countries to developing countries where labor is cheaper.

### 3. Education and Skills Mismatch
Sometimes the education system does not evolve as rapidly as the [job market](../j/job_market.md), leading to a workforce that may not possess the necessary skills to meet current [market](../m/market.md) demands.

### 4. Industry Decline
Certain industries may decline due to changes in consumer preferences, regulations, or other [market](../m/market.md) forces. Workers employed in these industries may find it difficult to transfer their skills to growing industries.

### 5. Geographical Mismatch
Jobs might be available in one region while the [supply](../s/supply.md) of labor might be concentrated in another. Workers may be unwilling or unable to relocate due to various reasons, including housing prices, family ties, and more.

### 6. Policy and Legislation
[Government policies](../g/government_policies_in_trading.md), such as [minimum wage](../m/minimum_wage.md) laws or stringent labor regulations, can also contribute to structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

## Impacts of Structural Unemployment

### Economic Impact
Structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) can lead to a significant loss in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). An [economy](../e/economy.md) with high structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) operates below its full potential, leading to inefficiencies.

### Social Impact
High levels of structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) can lead to increased social issues such as crime, [poverty](../p/poverty.md), and mental health issues. It can also result in a loss of [human capital](../h/human_capital.md) over time.

### Individual Impact
For the individual, structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) can mean long periods of joblessness, which can lead to a deterioration of skills, reduced lifetime [earnings](../e/earnings.md), and financial instability.

## Addressing Structural Unemployment

### 1. Retraining and Education Programs
Governments and private sectors can invest in retraining programs that help workers acquire skills that are in [demand](../d/demand.md). Online courses, community colleges, and vocational training can be effective.

### 2. Subsidies and Incentives
[Offering](../o/offering.md) subsidies and incentives for businesses to invest in economically depressed areas can help in creating jobs where they are most needed.

### 3. Flexibility in Labor Markets
Encouraging a more flexible [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) where there is ease of movement across regions and sectors can help in reducing structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). Policies like easier licensing for professions can help.

### 4. Technological Adaptation
Encouraging businesses to adopt new technologies as well as supporting workers to adapt to these technological changes can help mitigate structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) caused by technological advancements.

### 5. Sectoral Policies
Targeted sectoral policies can also help. If a particular [industry](../i/industry.md) is experiencing decline, government intervention can help in transitioning the workforce to more stable or growing industries.

## Examples of Structural Unemployment

### The Rust Belt in the USA
The decline of the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) sector in the Rust Belt states due to [globalization](../g/globalization.md) and technological changes has led to high levels of structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). Efforts have been made through various retraining programs and economic incentives to revive the [job market](../j/job_market.md) there.

### Coal Mining in the UK
The decline of the coal [mining](../m/mining.md) [industry](../i/industry.md) in the UK led to widespread structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) in [mining](../m/mining.md) communities. Various initiatives like retraining programs and economic [diversification](../d/diversification.md) schemes have been introduced to tackle the [issue](../i/issue.md).

### The Impact of AI and Automation
The rise of [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) and automation has led to job losses in various sectors such as retail and [customer service](../c/customer_service.md). The [gig economy](../g/gig_economy.md) and retraining initiatives are partially addressing this [issue](../i/issue.md).

## Research and Case Studies

### The German Apprenticeship Program
Germany's apprenticeship model is often cited as a successful way to address structural [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). The program combines on-the-job training with vocational education, thereby ensuring that the skills of the workforce align with the needs of industries.

### Singapore's Workforce Development Agency (WDA)
The WDA in Singapore offers various initiatives aimed at upskilling workers. These initiatives include SkillsFuture, which provides training subsidies, and career [guidance](../g/guidance.md) services designed to help workers adapt to the changing economic landscape.
