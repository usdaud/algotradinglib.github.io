# Social Responsibility

Social responsibility in the context of [finance](../f/finance.md) entails the ethical framework and suggests that entities, whether they be individuals, businesses, or organizations, have a duty to act in the best interests of their environment and society as a whole. It is an evolving philosophy that aims to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) financial resources for societal betterment without compromising future generations. This concept takes various forms and applies to several facets of the financial world including investment, [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), and policy-making.

## Dimensions of Social Responsibility in Finance

### Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

Corporate Social Responsibility refers to a company's commitment to operate in an ethical, sustainable, and socially conscious manner. This often involves engaging in actions that further social good beyond the interests of the [firm](../f/firm.md) and that which is required by law. CSR focuses on a variety of topics such as environmental stewardship, ethical labor practices, fair [trade](../t/trade.md), and [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md).

### Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria

ESG criteria are a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments. Environmental criteria consider how a company performs as a steward of nature. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. Governance deals with a company’s [leadership](../l/leadership.md), executive pay, audits, [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md), and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) rights.

### Sustainable Investing

Sustainable [investing](../i/investing.md), also known as socially responsible [investing](../i/investing.md) or [ethical investing](../e/ethical_investing.md), involves putting [money](../m/money.md) into companies and funds with the intention of generating measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial [return](../r/return.md). Investors use ESG criteria to identify companies that are leading in sustainability practices. Sustainable [investing](../i/investing.md) encompasses [green bonds](../g/green_bonds.md), [impact investing](../i/impact_investing.md), and other strategies that prioritize long-term direct benefits to both society and the environment.

### Impact Investing

[Impact investing](../i/impact_investing.md) refers to investments made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate a social or environmental impact alongside a financial [return](../r/return.md). This is distinct from [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md), as the primary aim is to have a measurable, positive impact. Examples include investments in renewable energy, [microfinance](../m/microfinance.md) institutions, and companies providing essential services in underserved areas.

### Ethical Banking

Ethical banks, also termed as sustainable banks, emphasize [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and social responsibility in their operations. These banks prioritize lending to projects or enterprises that contribute positively to society and the environment. They avoid [financing](../f/financing.md) activities that are harmful, such as those contributing to environmental degradation, human rights abuses, and corruption.

## Implementation and Standards

### Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

The Global Reporting Initiative provides a comprehensive sustainability reporting framework that is widely used around the world. It sets out the principles and indicators organizations can use to measure and report their economic, environmental, and social performance.

### Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)

The PRI, backed by the United Nations, is a network of investors working to promote sustainable investment through the [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) of ESG factors into investment decision-making and ownership practices. The principles provide a framework for investors to manage a [range](../r/range.md) of contexts in which they operate, be it equities, bonds, [private equity](../p/private_equity.md), or [real estate](../r/real_estate.md).

### Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

The TCFD develops voluntary, consistent climate-related [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) disclosures for use by companies in providing information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders. Companies are encouraged to disclose their governance around climate-related risks and opportunities, the actual and potential impacts of these risks and opportunities on their [business](../b/business.md), strategy, and [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

### Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)

The SASB develops and disseminates sustainability [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards. It offers [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on the [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of material sustainability information. The approach integrates with the financial reporting cycle of companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on U.S. stock exchanges and aims for concise, comparable sustainability metrics.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Patagonia

Patagonia, the outdoor apparel company, epitomizes corporate social responsibility by donating a percentage of profits to environmental causes, producing sustainably sourced goods, and [offering](../o/offering.md) grants to grassroots environmental organizations. Known for its commitment to environmental stewardship, Patagonia has embedded social responsibility into its core [business](../b/business.md) practices.

### Unilever

Unilever has committed to sustainable living plans that enhance the environmental footprint of its operations and products. The company has implemented numerous sustainability initiatives, such as cutting greenhouse gas emissions, improving water and waste management, and ensuring responsible sourcing. The [firm](../f/firm.md) publicly reports on progress against these targets, fostering [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

### IBM

IBM has an extensive history of social responsibility initiatives, from early equal employment practices to contemporary efforts in [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) ethics and climate-related projects. The company integrates these initiatives into its broader [business](../b/business.md) model and regularly publishes detailed CSR reports highlighting achievements and areas of improvement.

### Triple Bottom Line Accounting

The concept of the [triple bottom](../t/triple_bottom.md) line [accounting](../a/accounting.md)—People, Planet, [Profit](../p/profit.md)—is gaining traction. This approach goes beyond traditional financial metrics to also measure a company's social and environmental impact. Future [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards may more comprehensively account for these additional criteria.

### Growing Importance of Corporate Activism

As social movements [gain](../g/gain.md) prominence, companies are increasingly expected to take stands on social issues ranging from climate change to racial inequality. How businesses respond can significantly influence their reputation and consumer support.

## AI and Machine Learning in Social Responsibility
