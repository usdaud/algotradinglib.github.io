# Simulated Annealing

[Simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It was first introduced in the early 1980s in the context of [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems in physics but has since found a wide array of applications in various fields, including trading and [finance](../f/finance.md). In trading, [simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) is used to optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), thereby maximizing returns or minimizing [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Introduction to Simulated Annealing

[Simulated Annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, where a material is heated to a high temperature and then gradually cooled to remove defects, resulting in a more stable structure. Analogously, [simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) applies this principle to [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems by exploring regions of the solution space at higher "temperatures" (probability levels) and then stabilizing at lower temperatures to hone in on the optimal solution.

### The Algorithm

The SA algorithm involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial solution and an initial temperature.
2. **Iteration**:
    1. Generate a neighbor solution.
    2. Calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between the current solution and the neighbor.
    3. If the neighbor solution is better (ΔE < 0), accept it.
    4. If the neighbor solution is worse (ΔE > 0), accept it with a certain probability P, which decreases as the algorithm progresses.
3. **Cooling Schedule**: Gradually decrease the temperature according to a cooling schedule.
4. **Termination**: Stop the algorithm after a predefined number of iterations or when the temperature reaches a certain threshold.

### Energy Function and Cost Function

In trading, the energy function is often analogous to the cost function, which could be defined in numerous ways depending on the goal. Common cost functions include:

- **Maximizing [Profit](../p/profit.md)**: The goal is to find the combination of trading parameters that [yield](../y/yield.md) the highest possible returns.
- **Minimizing [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Optimize to achieve the least possible [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure.
- **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**: Combine both [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) into a single cost function by maximizing the [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md).

### Applications in Trading

#### Portfolio Optimization

One of the [principal](../p/principal.md) applications of [simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) in trading is [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md). Traditional methods like the Markowitz [Efficient Frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md) assume normal distributions and linear relationships between assets. SA, however, does not require these assumptions and can efficiently [handle](../h/handle.md) non-convex, [non-linear optimization](../n/non-linear_optimization.md) problems.

#### Algorithmic Trading Strategies

[Simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) can be used to optimize parameters in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies. For example, in a [momentum](../m/momentum.md)-based strategy, you might want to optimize the look-back period and the thresholds for entering and exiting trades. [Simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) allows exploring these parameter spaces more effectively than [grid search](../g/grid_search_in_trading.md) or random search.

#### Model Calibration

In [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md), models are often calibrated using historical data to make forward predictions. [Simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) can aid in calibrating complex models by minimizing the error rate between predicted and historical values.

### Advantages of Simulated Annealing

1. **Global Optimality**: Unlike local search methods that can get stuck in local optima, [simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) has a higher chance of finding the global optimum.
2. **Flexibility**: It can [handle](../h/handle.md) complex, non-linear, and non-[convex optimization](../c/convex_optimization.md) problems.
3. **No Gradient Required**: Useful for functions that are not differentiable or when calculating the gradient is computationally expensive.
4. **Easy to Implement**: While conceptually simple, the algorithm can be adapted for a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems.

### Limitations and Challenges

1. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The performance of [simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) heavily depends on the choice of parameters, such as the initial temperature, cooling schedule, and acceptance probability.
2. **Computational Intensity**: It can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional spaces.
3. **No Guaranteed Optimum**: While it increases the chances of finding the global optimum, it does not guarantee it.
4. **Slow Convergence**: The algorithm may require a large number of iterations to converge, making it slower in comparison to other methods like [Genetic Algorithms](../g/genetic_algorithms_in_trading.md) or Particle Swarm [Optimization](../o/optimization.md).

### Case Study: Simulated Annealing in Forex Trading

Forex trading involves buying and selling [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs and is characterized by high [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Optimizing a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) in Forex can be challenging due to the sheer number of variables involved, such as [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), entry and exit points, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) rules.

#### The Setup

1. **Objective**: Maximize the returns of a Forex [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).
2. **Parameters**: [Technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) (e.g., moving averages, RSI), [trade](../t/trade.md) entry and exit levels, stop-loss, and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) levels.
3. **Cost Function**: Negative cumulative returns, aiming to minimize this [value](../v/value.md).

#### Process

1. **Initialization**: Start with a random set of parameters and an initial temperature.
2. **Iteration**: 
    - Generate a neighboring set of parameters by tweaking one or more variables.
    - Backtest the new parameters on historical data.
    - Calculate the energy (negative returns).
    - Accept or reject the new set based on the energy difference and the current temperature.
3. **Cooling Schedule**:
    - Gradual decrease of temperature, allowing the system to stabilize on optimal or near-optimal parameters.
4. **Termination**: Stop after a thousand iterations or when the temperature reaches a predefined threshold.

#### Results

The [simulated annealing](../s/simulated_annealing.md) approach resulted in a set of parameters that outperformed the initial configuration by a significant [margin](../m/margin.md). While not guaranteeing the optimal outcome, the method provided a [robust](../r/robust.md) and effective means of optimizing the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).
