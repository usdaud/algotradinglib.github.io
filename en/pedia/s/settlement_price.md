# Settlement Price

The settlement price is the official price used to mark positions to market and calculate daily profit and loss. It is set by the exchange and is distinct from the last trade price.

## Determination
Exchanges use a defined method such as a closing auction, a volume weighted average, or a specific time window of trades. The method aims to reflect a fair price for valuation and margining.

## Example
A futures contract settles at 2,500. A trader long one contract is credited or debited based on the change from the prior settlement price.

## Practical notes
Settlement prices drive margin requirements and daily PnL. Traders should know when and how settlements are calculated for their instruments.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Settlement Price and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Settlement Price as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Settlement Price, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Settlement Price. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Settlement Price alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
