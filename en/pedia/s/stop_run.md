# Stop Run

A stop run is a rapid price move through a level that triggers a cluster of stop orders. The triggered orders add momentum and can cause temporary spikes.

## How it appears
- Price accelerates through a known level.
- Volume spikes as stops trigger.
- Price may reverse after the stops are cleared.

## Example
A currency pair breaks below a recent low and cascades lower as stop orders trigger. After the stops are filled, price stabilizes and rebounds.

## Practical notes
Stop runs can be mistaken for true breakouts. Watching follow through and volume helps distinguish the two.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Stop Run and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Stop Run as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Stop Run, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Stop Run. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Stop Run alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
