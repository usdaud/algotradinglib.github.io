# Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)

A Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) is a nonqualified retirement plan specifically designed to address the retirement needs of highly compensated executives, typically offered by a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) as an additional benefit to its senior management team. Unlike qualified retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, SERPs are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and contribution limits, [offering](../o/offering.md) more flexibility for employers to provide targeted retirement benefits to key employees.

## Key Features of SERP

### Nonqualified Plan
SERPs are categorized as nonqualified plans under the Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act (ERISA). This categorization means that they do not have to comply with most of ERISA’s stringent requirements, including nondiscrimination rules. This allows companies to [offer](../o/offer.md) these plans exclusively to a select group of management or highly compensated employees.

### Flexibility in Plan Design
One of the significant advantages of SERPs is their flexibility. Companies can tailor these plans to meet specific objectives, such as recruiting top talent, retaining critical employees, or rewarding long-term service. This flexibility extends to the benefits structure, funding strategies, and [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedules.

### Deferred Compensation
SERPs often involve [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) arrangements, allowing executives to defer a portion of their [income](../i/income.md) until retirement. This deferral can provide substantial tax benefits because the deferred [income](../i/income.md) is not taxed until it is actually received, which typically occurs when the executive is in a lower tax bracket post-retirement.

### Funding Mechanisms
While SERPs are unfunded [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of the employer, meaning the benefits are paid out of the company’s general assets, companies can choose to informally [fund](../f/fund.md) these [obligations](../o/obligation.md) through various mechanisms. Common strategies include setting aside funds in a separate [trust](../t/trust.md) or [investing](../i/investing.md) in [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies.

## Importance for Executives and Employers

### Attracting and Retaining Talent
In a competitive [job market](../j/job_market.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a SERP can be a decisive [factor](../f/factor.md) in attracting and retaining top-tier executives. These plans provide additional financial [security](../s/security.md) and retirement [income](../i/income.md), making the overall compensation package more attractive.

### Enhancing Executive Loyalty
SERPs can be structured with specific performance-based or tenure-based [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedules, incentivizing executives to remain with the company longer. This aligns the interests of the executives with the long-term goals of the company, fostering loyalty and commitment.

### Customizable Benefits
Employers can design SERPs to provide a broad [range](../r/range.md) of benefits beyond retirement [income](../i/income.md), such as disability and survivor benefits. This customization allows companies to address the unique needs and circumstances of their executive team.

### Tax Advantages
For both the company and the executive, SERPs provide tax advantages. Contributions to the plan by the company are not immediately tax-deductible, but the payouts to the executives are tax-deductible when they are made. For executives, the deferral of [income](../i/income.md) can result in significant tax savings.

## Risks and Considerations

### Lack of ERISA Protection
While the lack of ERISA compliance provides flexibility, it also means that the benefits under a SERP are not protected in the event of the company’s [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md). Executives are considered [unsecured creditors](../u/unsecured_creditors.md) and may not receive the promised benefits if the company faces financial difficulties.

### Tax Implications
The [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) arrangements in SERPs must comply with Section 409A of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code, which imposes specific rules on the timing of deferrals and distributions. Failure to comply with these rules can result in significant tax penalties for the executives.

### Regulatory Environment
Though less regulated than qualified plans, SERPs still must navigate various federal and state regulations. Companies must ensure their plans are designed and administered in compliance with all applicable laws to avoid penalties and legal challenges.

## Examples of Companies Offering SERP

Several large corporations [offer](../o/offer.md) SERP as a part of their executive compensation packages. Here are a few examples:

- **GE**: General Electric provides SERP to its senior executives as part of their overall retirement benefits package.
- **IBM**: IBM offers a SERP to its high-ranking executives, which is designed to supplement their retirement [income](../i/income.md).
- **AT&T**: AT&T provides a comprehensive SERP to retain and reward its senior management team.

## Conclusion

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs) play a crucial role in the compensation structure of many corporations, providing significant benefits for both employers and executives. The flexibility, tax advantages, and ability to attract and retain top talent make SERPs an essential tool in the competitive landscape of executive compensation. However, the design and administration of these plans require careful consideration of tax implications, regulatory requirements, and potential risks to ensure they meet the intended objectives without exposing the company or the executives to unintended consequences.
