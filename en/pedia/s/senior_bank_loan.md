# Senior Bank Loan

A senior [bank](../b/bank.md) [loan](../l/loan.md), often simply referred to as a senior [loan](../l/loan.md), is a type of [financing](../f/financing.md) provided by banks or financial institutions to corporations, typically for growth, acquisitions, or refinancing. Senior loans are called "senior" because they take precedence over other types of [debt](../d/debt.md) securities in terms of [repayment](../r/repayment.md) priority in case of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) or [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md).

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## Characteristics of Senior Bank Loans

### Seniority
Senior loans are considered senior [debt](../d/debt.md), meaning they have a higher claim on the borrower's assets in the event of [default](../d/default.md). This places them above subordinate [debt](../d/debt.md) or junior loans, which have less priority in the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) hierarchy.

### Collateral
Senior loans are usually secured by [collateral](../c/collateral.md), which can include the company's assets such as [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), machinery, [inventory](../i/inventory.md), or receivables. The [collateral](../c/collateral.md) reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) for the [lender](../l/lender.md) and often results in lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to unsecured loans.

### Floating Interest Rate
Typically, senior loans have floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates that are pegged to a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) like the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate (SOFR), plus a fixed spread. This means the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can fluctuate over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Covenants
Lenders usually impose covenants—terms and conditions the borrower must adhere to—to protect their investment. These can include maintaining certain [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md), limiting additional borrowing, or restrictions on [asset](../a/asset.md) sales.

### Syndication
Senior loans are often syndicated, meaning a group of lenders, usually composed of banks and institutional investors, share the funding and the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the [loan](../l/loan.md). This process is typically managed by a lead arranger.

## Purpose and Usage

### Growth and Expansion
Corporations often use senior loans to [finance](../f/finance.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md) activities, such as opening new facilities, launching new products, or entering new markets.

### Acquisitions
Senior loans are common in mergers and acquisitions, where companies require substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) to purchase another [business](../b/business.md) or merge with another entity.

### Refinancing
Companies may also use senior loans to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) existing [debt](../d/debt.md), particularly when they can secure better terms or when their existing [debt](../d/debt.md) is maturing.

### Working Capital
Some businesses utilize senior loans to improve their working [capital](../c/capital.md), ensuring they have enough [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for day-to-day operations.

## Advantages of Senior Bank Loans

### Priority in Repayment
One of the primary advantages of senior loans for lenders is their priority in [repayment](../r/repayment.md). In the event of a company's [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), senior loans are paid before [subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) holders.

### Lower Risk with Collateral
The [collateral](../c/collateral.md) backing senior loans provides a safety net. If the borrower defaults, the [lender](../l/lender.md) has the right to seize the [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to recoup their investment.

### Potential for Higher Returns
For investors, senior loans [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for higher returns compared to other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities, given their floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and higher priority in the [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md).

### Diversification
Senior loans provide an opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios, as they often have low [correlation](../c/correlation.md) with traditional fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investments like government bonds.

## Disadvantages of Senior Bank Loans

### Floating Interest Rates
While floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can be advantageous when rates are stable or declining, they pose a [risk](../r/risk.md) if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise significantly, increasing the cost of borrowing.

### Covenant Restrictions
The covenants attached to senior loans can be restrictive for borrowers, limiting their financial and operational flexibility.

### Complexity
The syndication process can be complex and time-consuming, involving numerous lenders and detailed negotiations to finalize the terms.

### Liquidity
For investors, an [issue](../i/issue.md) with senior loans is [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Since they're not traded on public exchanges, selling these loans can be more complicated compared to traditional securities.

## Market for Senior Bank Loans

### Institutional Investors
Senior loans attract a wide [range](../r/range.md) of institutional investors, including mutual funds, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, pension funds, and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds. These investors seek the attractive [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns and [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md).

### CLOs (Collateralized Loan Obligations)
Senior loans are often packaged into Collateralized [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Obligations](../o/obligation.md) (CLOs). CLOs are complicated financial instruments that consist of a pool of loans, securitized and structured into [tranches](../t/tranches.md) with varying [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profiles. This allows different types of investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to senior loans according to their [risk](../r/risk.md) appetite.

### Secondary Market
While less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than public [debt](../d/debt.md) markets, there exists a [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) for senior loans, where they can be bought and sold among institutional investors.

## Regulatory Considerations

### Basel III
Under [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), an international regulatory framework, banks must [hold](../h/hold.md) higher levels of [capital](../c/capital.md) to cover potential losses from loans, including senior loans. This influences banks' lending practices and the overall availability of senior [loan](../l/loan.md) [financing](../f/financing.md).

### Risk Retention Rules
In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes [risk](../r/risk.md) retention rules, requiring sponsors of securitized products like CLOs to retain a portion of the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), aligning their interests with those of investors.

## Real-World Examples

### Leveraged Buyouts
Senior loans are a critical component in leveraged buyouts (LBOs), where [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) firms acquire companies primarily using [debt](../d/debt.md). They rely on senior loans for the majority of the [financing](../f/financing.md) due to their favorable terms and lower cost relative to other [debt](../d/debt.md) forms.

### Corporate Restructuring
During corporate [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md), companies may utilize senior loans to stabilize their finances, paying off or consolidating existing debts to manage their liabilities better.

### Mergers and Acquisitions
Companies engaging in mergers and acquisitions often secure senior loans to facilitate transactions, leveraging their strengths and ensuring they have the necessary [capital](../c/capital.md) to complete deals.

## Conclusion

Senior [bank](../b/bank.md) loans play a vital role in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), providing companies with the necessary [capital](../c/capital.md) to grow, acquire, and [refinance](../r/refinance.md), while [offering](../o/offering.md) lenders and investors attractive [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns and priority in [repayment](../r/repayment.md). Despite certain disadvantages, such as the complexity and potential restrictions of covenants, senior loans remain a popular [financing](../f/financing.md) tool due to their secured nature and the relative [security](../s/security.md) they provide in terms of [repayment](../r/repayment.md) hierarchy.

Understanding the intricacies of senior loans, including their structure, [market](../m/market.md), advantages, and disadvantages is essential for both borrowers and investors to make informed financial decisions. Whether utilized for [expansion](../e/expansion.md), acquisitions, or refinancing, senior loans [will](../w/will.md) continue to be a key [asset](../a/asset.md) in the financial landscape.
