# Stock Exchange Daily Official List (SEDOL)

The Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Daily Official List, widely known by its acronym SEDOL, is a unique identification code assigned to securities and other financial instruments traded on the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) and other markets. This code is an essential tool for identifying specific securities, ensuring accuracy in processing trades, and maintaining efficient record-keeping in electronic trading and settlement systems.

## What is SEDOL?

SEDOL stands for Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Daily Official List, and it is a seven-character alphanumeric code. Introduced in 1979, SEDOL numbers serve as a means to uniquely identify stock issues in the United Kingdom, helping to enhance clarity and streamline trading and settlement processes. They are particularly critical in the domain of electronic trading and record-keeping.

## Composition of a SEDOL Code

A typical SEDOL code is composed of seven characters, which can be a mix of digits and letters. The first six characters are alphanumeric, while the seventh character is a [check](../c/check.md) digit. The structure of the SEDOL code is designed to ensure that each code is unique and can be easily validated using a mathematical algorithm.

Here is an example of a SEDOL code: `B0WLJY2`

The last character `2` in the above example represents the [check](../c/check.md) digit, which is calculated using a [weighted](../w/weighted.md) formula derived from the first six characters.

## Calculation of the Check Digit

The [check](../c/check.md) digit in a SEDOL code is calculated using a [weighted](../w/weighted.md) modulus-10 algorithm. Each of the first six characters is assigned a weight based on their position from right to left. The weights are as follows: 1, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9. Each character in the SEDOL code, whether it is a digit or a letter, is assigned a numeric [value](../v/value.md). Letters are converted into numbers where A=10, B=11,..., Z=35. The calculations involve summing these [weighted](../w/weighted.md) values and then computing the modulus 10 of that sum, which determines the [check](../c/check.md) digit.

## Importance of SEDOL

SEDOL codes are crucial for identifying securities accurately. In a global marketplace, ensuring that each [security](../s/security.md) has a unique identifier helps avoid confusion and errors in transactions. This is particularly important when:

- **Trading:** SEDOL codes ensure that traders and brokers are buying and selling the correct securities, minimizing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of costly errors.
- **Settlement:** Accurate identification of securities ensures that [trade](../t/trade.md) settlements occur smoothly, without discrepancies.
- **Compliance:** Proper identification and record-keeping are essential for regulatory compliance, ensuring that all transactions are legally sound and auditable.

## Governance and Management of SEDOL

The SEDOL code system is maintained and governed by the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Group (LSEG). The LSEG ensures that SEDOL codes are issued systematically and that the database of SEDOL numbers is kept up to date. The LSEG also provides necessary support to users of the SEDOL system, including financial institutions, investment firms, and other stakeholders in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Accessing SEDOL Information

Access to the SEDOL database is available through subscription services provided by the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md). This service offers up-to-date information on SEDOL codes, allowing subscribers to search for and verify the codes of specific securities. You can find more information about subscriptions and access on the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) online platform here.

## SEDOL in Electronic Trading Systems

In the modern financial [market](../m/market.md), electronic [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) are widely used for executing trades rapidly and efficiently. SEDOL codes play a vital role in such systems by providing a standardized way to reference securities across different platforms and institutions. The ability to quickly and accurately identify securities using SEDOL codes helps facilitate high-frequency trading and other forms of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), where speed and precision are paramount.

## Compatibility with Other Identifier Systems

While SEDOL is a widely used identifier in the UK, it is often used in conjunction with other international securities identification systems. The most notable of these is the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN), which is a 12-character alphanumeric code used globally. ISIN often incorporates SEDOL as part of its structure for UK-issued securities. Other identifiers like CUSIP (used primarily in the US) and ticker symbols are also used alongside SEDOL to ensure clear and consistent identification across various markets.

## Conclusion

The Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Daily Official List (SEDOL) is an indispensable tool in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading. By providing a unique identifier for securities, it helps to eliminate confusion, ensure accuracy, and facilitate smooth trading and settlement operations. Maintained by the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Group, SEDOL continues to be a cornerstone in the [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), underscoring the importance of standardized identification systems in a globally interconnected [economy](../e/economy.md).
