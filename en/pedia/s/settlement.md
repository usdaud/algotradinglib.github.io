# Settlement

Settlement is the process of finalizing a trade by transferring ownership and cash between buyer and seller. It is the back end step that completes a transaction after execution.

## Key elements
- Trade date: the day the trade is executed.
- Settlement date: the day ownership and cash are exchanged.
- Clearing: the process of matching and confirming trades before settlement.

## Example
An equity trade is executed on Monday. Under a T+2 cycle, the settlement occurs on Wednesday, when shares are delivered and cash is exchanged.

## Practical notes
Settlement cycles vary by market and asset class. Delays or fails can create operational risk and penalties.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Settlement and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Settlement as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Settlement, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Settlement. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Settlement alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
