# Signal Noise Ratio

Signal noise ratio measures the strength of a useful signal relative to random variation. In trading, it helps assess whether a strategy has a real edge or is dominated by noise.

## Concept
- Signal is the predictable component of returns.
- Noise is the unpredictable or random component.

## Example
A model shows small consistent gains but large day to day volatility. The low signal noise ratio suggests the model may be unreliable without additional filtering.

## Practical notes
Improving the signal noise ratio often involves longer horizons, better features, or stronger risk controls. Overfitting can falsely inflate the ratio in backtests.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Signal Noise Ratio and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Signal Noise Ratio as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Signal Noise Ratio, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Signal Noise Ratio. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Signal Noise Ratio alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
