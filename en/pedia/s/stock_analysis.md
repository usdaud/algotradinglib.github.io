# Stock Analysis

Stock analysis is the process of evaluating and examining the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) to predict the future movements of stock prices and to determine the potential profitability of [investing](../i/investing.md) in particular securities. This practice involves using historical data, [market](../m/market.md) trends, statistical measures, and various analytical tools and methodologies to make well-informed investment decisions. It forms the bedrock of strategies employed by investors and traders in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), and is crucial for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), [portfolio management](../p/par.md), and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) enhancement.

## Fundamental Analysis

[Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) involves evaluating a company's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), health, [business](../b/business.md) model, economic moats, and competitive advantages. This type of analysis looks at [income](../i/income.md) statements, balance sheets, [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) statements, and key [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) such as P/E ratio, ROI, and ROE. Analysts also consider macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and [industry](../i/industry.md) conditions. The aim is to determine the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a stock and compare it to its current [market price](../m/market_price.md) to decide if it’s [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md).

**Key Components:**

### Financial Statements

1. **[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md):** Shows a company's revenues, expenses, and profitability over a specific period. Key metrics include net [income](../i/income.md), [gross profit margin](../g/gross_profit_margin.md), and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS).

2. **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md):** Provides a snapshot of a company's financial condition at a specific point in time. It lists assets, liabilities, and shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md). Important metrics include [current ratio](../c/current_ratio.md), [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio, and [book value](../b/book_value.md).

3. **[Cash Flow Statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md):** Tracks the cash inflows and outflows from operating, [investing](../i/investing.md), and [financing](../f/financing.md) activities. Key metrics include free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) and operating [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).

### Financial Ratios

1. **Price-to-[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (P/E) Ratio:** Measures a company's current share price relative to its per-share [earnings](../e/earnings.md). A high P/E might indicate that a stock is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md), whereas a low P/E might indicate undervaluation.

2. **[Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROE):** Calculates how efficiently a company is using shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) to generate [profit](../p/profit.md). It's represented as a percentage and higher values are generally favorable.

3. **[Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Equity](../e/equity.md) Ratio:** Indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) used to [finance](../f/finance.md) a company's assets. A lower ratio ideally signals a healthier balance.

4. **[Return](../r/return.md) on Investment (ROI):** Measures the [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss generated on an investment relative to the amount of [money](../m/money.md) invested. A higher ROI indicates more efficient utilization of investment funds.

3. **Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD):** A [trend](../t/trend.md)-following [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock’s price.

4. **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_band.md):** Consist of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands (standard deviations away from the middle band), indicating potential [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

### Chart Patterns

1. **Head and Shoulders:** A [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern that can signal a change in [trend](../t/trend.md), often considered bearish when found at [market](../m/market.md) tops.

2. **Double Tops and Bottoms:** Indicate a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) from an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) or [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), respectively, suggesting potential changes in price direction.
