# Stock Dividend

A stock [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is a [payment](../p/payment.md) made by a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) to its shareholders in the form of additional [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock rather than cash. This [distribution](../d/distribution.md) is made proportionally so that shareholders receive additional [shares](../s/shares.md) commensurate with their existing [holdings](../h/holdings.md). Receiving additional [shares](../s/shares.md) however does not affect the overall [value](../v/value.md) of shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) because while the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) increases, the proportionate [value](../v/value.md) of those [shares](../s/shares.md) remains the same.

## Definition and Mechanism

### How Stock Dividends Work

When a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) earns a [profit](../p/profit.md), it has several [options](../o/options.md) for how to use that [profit](../p/profit.md): reinvesting it in the company, paying down [debt](../d/debt.md), or returning it to shareholders among others. When the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) decides to [return](../r/return.md) some of that [profit](../p/profit.md) to shareholders, it can do so through dividends, which can be paid either in cash or additional [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock.

Stock dividends are declared based on the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that an [investor](../i/investor.md) currently holds. For example, a 5% stock [dividend](../d/dividend.md) would mean that a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) would receive one additional share for every 20 [shares](../s/shares.md) they already own.

### Key Characteristics

- **Proportional [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: Stock dividends are issued on a pro-rata [basis](../b/basis.md), ensuring that each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md)'s percentage ownership in the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) remains [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md).
- **No Cash Outflow**: Unlike cash dividends, stock dividends do not require a cash outflow from the company.
- **Declaration and [Payment](../p/payment.md) Dates**: The declaration date, [record date](../r/record_date.md), and [payment](../p/payment.md) date are key milestones in the issuance of stock dividends.
- **[Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md) Reaction**: The [market](../m/market.md) generally adjusts the [value](../v/value.md) of the company’s stock to reflect the issuance of additional [shares](../s/shares.md), meaning the price per share usually decreases even as the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding increases.

## Benefits of Stock Dividends

### For the Company

1. **Conservation of Cash**: Companies can conserve cash while still rewarding shareholders.
2. **Positive Signal**: Declaring a stock [dividend](../d/dividend.md) can signal confidence in the company's future [earnings](../e/earnings.md) potential.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Increasing the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) can often improve the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of the stock, making it easier for investors to buy and sell.
4. **Tax Advantages**: Some jurisdictions may [offer](../o/offer.md) more favorable tax treatment on stock dividends compared to cash dividends.

### For the Shareholder

1. **Increasing Share Ownership**: Investors receive additional [shares](../s/shares.md), which can potentially lead to greater [wealth](../w/wealth.md) accumulation if the stock price appreciates in the future.
2. **Tax Deferral**: Depending on the tax regulations of the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s [home](../h/home.md) country, stock dividends may not be taxed until the [shares](../s/shares.md) are sold, deferring the [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).

## Types of Stock Dividends

### Regular Stock Dividend

This is the most common type, where additional [shares](../s/shares.md) are issued to existing shareholders. The [dividend](../d/dividend.md) percentage reflects how many more [shares](../s/shares.md) [will](../w/will.md) be provided relative to the current [holdings](../h/holdings.md).

### Special Stock Dividend

This type is issued on a one-off [basis](../b/basis.md) and usually comes as a windfall to shareholders, often during particularly strong [earnings](../e/earnings.md) periods or after a significant financial event.

## Financial Impact

### Share Price Adjustment

The issuance of a stock [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [will](../w/will.md) typically lead to a reduction in the share price. For example, if a company declares a 10% stock [dividend](../d/dividend.md) and its share price is $100, the theoretical post-[dividend](../d/dividend.md) price would adjust to approximately $90.91 (i.e., $100 / 1.10 = $90.91).

### Balance Sheet Considerations

Stock dividends [will](../w/will.md) lead to a transfer of amounts from [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) to [paid-in capital](../p/paid-in_capital.md) on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). This change reflects the [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) of [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) into share [capital](../c/capital.md).

### Shareholder Wealth

While the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) increases, the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of those [shares](../s/shares.md) typically adjusts so that the overall [value](../v/value.md) of shareholders' investments typically remains [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md) immediately following the stock [dividend](../d/dividend.md).

## Examples

Numerous companies across various sectors have a history of issuing stock dividends. For instance:

- Apple Inc.
- Tesla
- Coca-Cola

## Comparison with Stock Splits

Though both stock dividends and stock splits result in shareholders receiving more [shares](../s/shares.md), there are differences:

- **Stock [Dividend](../d/dividend.md)**: Shareholders receive additional [shares](../s/shares.md) as a [dividend](../d/dividend.md).
- **[Stock Split](../s/stock_split.md)**: The existing [shares](../s/shares.md) are split into [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) without impacting the total share [value](../v/value.md) immediately. For example, a 2-for-1 split means each share would be split into two [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Accounting Treatment

### Journal Entries

When a small stock [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is issued, the [journal](../j/journal.md) entry typically involves:

- **Declaration Date**:
 - [Debit](../d/debit.md): [Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)
 - [Credit](../c/credit.md): [Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md) Dividends Distributable
 - [Credit](../c/credit.md): [Additional Paid-in Capital](../a/additional_paid-in_capital.md) (if the [shares](../s/shares.md) are issued at a [market value](../m/market_value.md) greater than [par value](../p/par_value.md))

- **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Date**:
 - [Debit](../d/debit.md): [Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md) Dividends Distributable
 - [Credit](../c/credit.md): [Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md)

This process ensures the [equity](../e/equity.md) structure reflects the newly [issued shares](../i/issued_shares.md) appropriately.

### Financial Statement Impact

Stock dividends shift amounts from [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) to [paid-in capital](../p/paid-in_capital.md) without affecting the total [equity](../e/equity.md) [value](../v/value.md). This shift may impact metrics such as [Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROE) because [equity](../e/equity.md) isn't reducing; only its composition is altered.

## Regulatory and Tax Considerations

### Regulatory

Regulations can vary significantly across jurisdictions, but they generally require [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and fairness in the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of stock dividends. Companies must typically disclose relevant information regarding stock dividends to existing shareholders, including the ratio, rationale, and potential impact on the share price.

### Tax

The tax treatment of stock dividends can differ widely across countries. In some regions, stock dividends might be [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) until the [shares](../s/shares.md) are sold, while in others, they could be taxable upon receipt. Investors need to be aware of the tax regulations in their jurisdiction to effectively manage their investment portfolios.

## Risks and Considerations

1. **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md) Concerns**: Even though a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md)'s proportional ownership remains the same, an increase in the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) can dilute [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS).
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Perception**: If not communicated effectively, a stock [dividend](../d/dividend.md) might be perceived as a signal that the company lacks [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to pay a [cash dividend](../c/cash_dividend.md).
3. **Complexity in [Portfolio Management](../p/par.md)**: The issuance of stock dividends requires adjustments to portfolio tracking, particularly for large institutional investors.
4. **Potential for [Overextension](../o/overextension.md)**: Companies that [issue](../i/issue.md) frequent stock dividends or high-percentage stock dividends may be overextending themselves, which can be unsustainable in the long term.

## Conclusion

Stock dividends can be an effective financial tool for both corporations and shareholders. They allow companies to reward shareholders without depleting cash reserves while potentially signaling confidence in future [earnings](../e/earnings.md). For investors, stock dividends [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for increased share ownership and deferred tax liabilities. However, both parties must consider the implications on share price, [equity](../e/equity.md) composition, and overall [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) to maximize the benefits of stock dividends effectively.
