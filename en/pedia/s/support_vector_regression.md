# Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that is specifically designed for regression tasks. While SVM is widely known for its application in classification problems, SVR extends the SVM framework to predict continuous values, making it a powerful tool for regression in [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and [data science](../d/data_science_in_trading.md).

### Fundamentals of Support Vector Regression

The core idea behind SVR is to find a function that approximates the mapping from an input space to a continuous output space while maintaining a tolerance [margin](../m/margin.md) (epsilon-insensitive zone) around the predicted function. SVR seeks to minimize the error within this [margin](../m/margin.md), ignoring errors beyond this threshold to achieve a balance between underfitting and [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md).

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Objective Function

The primary goal of SVR is to minimize the following objective function:

\[ \min_{\mathbf{w}, \xi, \xi^*} \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\xi_i + \xi_i^*) \]

Subject to:
\[ y_i - (\mathbf{w} \cdot \phi(\mathbf{x}_i) + b) \leq \epsilon + \xi_i \]
\[ (\mathbf{w} \cdot \phi(\mathbf{x}_i) + b) - y_i \leq \epsilon + \xi_i^* \]
\[ \xi_i, \xi_i^* \geq 0 \]

Here:
- \(\mathbf{w}\) represents the weight vector.
- \(\phi(\mathbf{x}_i)\) is the feature transformation function.
- \(b\) is the bias term.
- \( \xi_i\) and \(\xi_i^* \) are slack variables representing deviations.
- \(\epsilon\) is the subjective loss [margin](../m/margin.md).
- \(C\) is a regularization parameter that controls the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between the flatness of the regression function and the tolerance to outliers.

#### Kernel Trick

SVR can [handle](../h/handle.md) non-linear relationships by applying the kernel trick. Kernels implicitly map the input data into a high-dimensional feature space where [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) can be performed. Commonly used kernels include:
- Linear Kernel
- Polynomial Kernel
- Radial [Basis](../b/basis.md) Function (RBF) Kernel
- Sigmoid Kernel

### Algorithm Procedure

1. **Data Preparation**: Begin with a dataset consisting of input-output pairs \((\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), (\mathbf{x}_2, y_2), \ldots, (\mathbf{x}_n, y_n)\).

2. **Kernel Selection**: Choose an appropriate kernel function based on the data [distribution](../d/distribution.md) and the nature of the regression problem.

3. **Parameter Tuning**: Determine the epsilon (\(\epsilon\)) and regularization parameter (C) values through techniques like cross-validation.

4. **Training the Model**: Solve the quadratic programming problem to determine the weight vector (\(\mathbf{w}\)) and bias (b) that minimize the objective function.

5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict new data. The prediction function is:
\[ f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w} \cdot \phi(\mathbf{x}) + b \]

### Applications of SVR

Support Vector Regression is employed in various real-world applications, such as:

- **[Financial Markets](../f/financial_market.md)**: Predicting stock prices and [financial time series](../f/financial_time_series.md).
- **Weather [Forecasting](../f/forecasting.md)**: Modeling temperature, humidity, and other climatic conditions.
- **Biomedical Engineering**: Predicting disease progression and patient outcomes.
- **Energy [Load](../l/load.md) [Forecasting](../f/forecasting.md)**: Estimating future energy consumption.
- **E-[commerce](../c/commerce.md)**: Price and [demand](../d/demand.md) prediction.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Flexibility**: Capable of modeling complex non-linear relationships using kernel functions.
- **Robustness**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and with a large number of features.
- **Generalization**: Good performance in unseen data due to the structured [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problem.

#### Disadvantages

- **Computational Cost**: SVR can be computationally intensive for large datasets, requiring significant memory and processing power.
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Choosing appropriate parameters (kernel, C, and \(\epsilon\)) can be challenging and requires domain knowledge and experimentation.

### Implementations of SVR

SVR is implemented in various [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) libraries and frameworks:

- **scikit-learn**: The popular Python library scikit-learn offers an easy-to-use implementation of SVR.
  - [scikit-learn SVR Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html)
- **LIBSVM**: A library for SVM and SVR, often used in academic research.
  - [LIBSVM Documentation](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)
- **[TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md)**: Google's [TensorFlow](../t/tensorflow.md) library also provides capabilities for regression using SVM.

### Conclusion

Support Vector Regression is a versatile and powerful technique for [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md), capable of handling both linear and non-linear relationships through the use of various kernel functions. Its application spans numerous fields, from [finance](../f/finance.md) to healthcare, highlighting its [utility](../u/utility.md) and effectiveness. Despite some challenges in computational complexity and parameter tuning, SVR remains a valuable tool for [predictive modeling](../p/predictive_modeling.md) in [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md).
