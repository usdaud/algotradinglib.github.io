# Scope

## Definition
In trading, "scope" typically refers to the [range](../r/range.md) or extent of price movement of a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) within a specific time frame. It's often used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to gauge [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential trading opportunities.

## Key Aspects

### 1. Price Range
- Measures the difference between the highest and lowest prices of an [asset](../a/asset.md) over a given period
- Often expressed in points, pips, or percentage

### 2. Time Frame
- Can be applied to various time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)
- Helps traders identify short-term and long-term trends

### 3. Volatility Indicator
- Large scope indicates high [volatility](../v/volatility.md)
- Small scope suggests low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md)

## Applications in Trading

### 1. Support and Resistance Levels
- Helps identify potential price levels where buying or selling pressure may increase
- Used to set entry and exit points for trades

### 2. Breakout Trading
- Traders watch for prices moving beyond the recent scope as potential [breakout](../b/breakout.md) signals
- Can indicate the start of new trends

### 3. Risk Management
- Assists in setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) based on typical price movements
- Helps in calculating position sizes relative to potential price swings

### 4. Volatility-based Strategies
- Some traders focus on high-scope (volatile) periods for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md)
- Others prefer low-scope periods for [range](../r/range.md)-bound [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md)

## Related Concepts

1. **[Average True Range](../a/average_true_range_(atr).md) (ATR)**
 - A technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that measures [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md)
 - Often used alongside scope analysis for a more comprehensive view

2. **Trading [Range](../r/range.md)**
 - Similar to scope but typically refers to longer-term price boundaries

3. **[Price Action](../p/price_action.md)**
 - The study of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price movement over time
 - Scope is one aspect of [price action analysis](../p/price_action_analysis.md)

## Importance in Trading Decisions

- Helps traders assess potential [profit](../p/profit.md) targets
- Aids in determining appropriate [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)
- Contributes to overall [market](../m/market.md) analysis and strategy development

## Limitations

- Past scope doesn't guarantee future price movements
- Should be used in conjunction with other technical and [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) tools
- May be less reliable during periods of extreme [market](../m/market.md) conditions or news events

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Scope and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Scope as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Scope, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Scope. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Scope alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
