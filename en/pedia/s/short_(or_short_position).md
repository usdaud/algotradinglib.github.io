# Short (or Short Position)

A short position, or simply "short,‚Äù is a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) where an [investor](../i/investor.md) borrows a [security](../s/security.md) and sells it on the [open market](../o/open_market.md), planning to buy it back later for less [money](../m/money.md). Shorting is motivated by the belief that the price of the [security](../s/security.md) [will](../w/will.md) drop, allowing the [investor](../i/investor.md) to [return](../r/return.md) the borrowed securities, pocketing the difference as [profit](../p/profit.md). This strategy is primarily used by traders looking to [profit](../p/profit.md) from bearish [market](../m/market.md) movements and is a staple in the toolbox of many [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and sophisticated investors.

## Mechanics of Short Selling

1. **Borrowing the [Asset](../a/asset.md)**: The [trader](../t/trader.md) borrows the [security](../s/security.md) from a [broker](../b/broker.md) or another [investor](../i/investor.md). This typically involves borrowing [stocks](../s/stock.md), but it can also apply to other securities like bonds, commodities, or currencies.

2. **Selling the Borrowed [Security](../s/security.md)**: Once the [security](../s/security.md) is borrowed, the [trader](../t/trader.md) sells it at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). This step is called "selling short."

3. **Waiting for the Price to Drop**: The [trader](../t/trader.md) waits for the [security](../s/security.md)'s price to decline. The [duration](../d/duration.md) could [range](../r/range.md) from minutes to several months, depending on the strategy and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

4. **Buying Back the [Security](../s/security.md)**: When the price has dropped sufficiently, the [trader](../t/trader.md) buys back the same number of securities (this is called "covering the short position").

5. **Returning the Borrowed [Security](../s/security.md)**: The [trader](../t/trader.md) returns the borrowed [security](../s/security.md) to the [lender](../l/lender.md). The difference between the selling price and the buying price, minus any borrowing fees, constitutes the [profit](../p/profit.md).

## Risks and Margin Requirements

[Short selling](../s/short_selling.md) involves several significant risks, primarily due to the potential for unlimited losses. The maximum loss on a long position is the total [value](../v/value.md) of the stock if it falls to zero. However, with a short position, there's no cap on how high the stock price can go, meaning losses can potentially be infinite.

To manage these risks, brokers require traders to meet [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements, which include:

- **[Initial Margin](../i/initial_margin.md)**: The percentage of the total [trade](../t/trade.md) [value](../v/value.md) that the [trader](../t/trader.md) must initially [deposit](../d/deposit.md). For instance, if a [broker](../b/broker.md)'s [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) requirement is 50%, and a [trader](../t/trader.md) wants to short $10,000 worth of stock, they must [deposit](../d/deposit.md) $5,000.

- **[Maintenance Margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md)**: The minimum [account balance](../a/account_balance.md) a [trader](../t/trader.md) must maintain while holding the short position. If the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s [account balance](../a/account_balance.md) falls below this level due to increasing stock prices, they are subject to a "[margin call](../m/margin_call.md)," requiring them to [deposit](../d/deposit.md) additional funds or cover the position.

## Short Selling Strategies

### 1. **Fundamental Shorting**
This is based on analyzing a company's fundamentals. Traders look for [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) or companies with weak [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), poor management, or declining sectors.

### 2. **Technical Shorting**
Technical analysts rely on [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md), [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md), and [market](../m/market.md) trends to predict price declines. Common patterns include head and shoulders, double tops, and resistance levels.

### 3. **Paired Trading**
This involves taking a short position in an [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) stock and a long position in an [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) stock in the same sector. The aim is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the relative performance of the two [stocks](../s/stock.md) while reducing [market risk](../m/market_risk.md).

### 4. **Event-Driven Shorting**
Traders short [stocks](../s/stock.md) based on impending negative news or events, such as [earnings](../e/earnings.md) misses, regulatory actions, or product failures.

## Short Selling and Markets

[Short selling](../s/short_selling.md) plays a crucial role in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) by:

- **Providing [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Short sellers contribute to [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by increasing the number of [market](../m/market.md) participants and trading [volume](../v/volume.md).
- **[Price Discovery](../p/price_discovery.md)**: They help in correcting [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) stock prices, ensuring more accurate [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md).
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Institutions and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds use [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) as a hedging tool to mitigate risks in their portfolios.

However, it can also have negative impacts, such as exacerbating [market](../m/market.md) declines and contributing to [volatility](../v/volatility.md). This led to temporary short-selling bans during significant [market](../m/market.md) events, like the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2008.

## Regulatory Aspects

[Short selling](../s/short_selling.md) is regulated to ensure [market](../m/market.md) integrity. Key regulations include:

- **[Uptick Rule](../u/uptick_rule.md)**: Originally implemented by the SEC in 1938, it required a stock to be sold short only at a price higher than the previous [trade](../t/trade.md). Though removed in 2007, a modified [uptick rule](../u/uptick_rule.md) was reintroduced in 2010 following the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

- **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) Requirements**: In many jurisdictions, traders must disclose significant short positions to regulatory authorities.

- **Naked [Short Selling](../s/short_selling.md)**: This illegal practice involves selling [shares](../s/shares.md) without borrowing them first. Regulations are in place to prevent such activities.

## Short Selling in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algo-trading, leverages [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and high-speed computing to execute [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) strategies efficiently. Key techniques include:

1. **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Using statistical models to identify and exploit price divergences between correlated assets.
   
2. **[Momentum Trading](../m/momentum_trading.md)**: Algorithms identify and short [stocks](../s/stock.md) demonstrating downward [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

3. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Based on the idea that [asset](../a/asset.md) prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical means, algorithms short [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) expected to decline.

### Tools and Technologies

- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) Software**: Allows [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) to be tested on historical data to gauge performance and refine strategies.
  
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Uses sophisticated algorithms and high-speed data feeds to execute numerous short trades rapidly.

- **[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md)**: Enhances [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) strategies by identifying patterns and predicting stock movements with greater accuracy.

## Fintech and Short Selling

Financial technology (Fintech) has revolutionized [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) by democratizing access to markets and providing innovative tools. Examples include:

- **Robo-Advisors**: Platforms like Betterment and Wealthfront [offer](../o/offer.md) [automated portfolio management](../a/automated_portfolio_management.md), including short-selling [options](../o/options.md).
  
- **[Social Trading](../s/social_trading.md) Platforms**: Platforms like [eToro](../e/etoro.md) allow traders to follow and replicate successful short-selling strategies of other investors.

- **[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and [Smart Contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md)**: Facilitates secure and transparent lending of securities for [short selling](../s/short_selling.md).

### Notable Fintech Companies

- **[Robinhood](../r/robinhood.md)**: [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) offers [commission](../c/commission.md)-free trades and a user-friendly app, attracting a younger generation of traders into the short-selling arena.

- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md)**: [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) provides advanced trading tools, including short-selling features, catering to both retail and institutional investors.
