# Speech Recognition

Speech Recognition is the technology that enables machines to convert spoken language into text, forming the [basis](../b/basis.md) for voice assistants, transcription services, and human-computer interaction through voice.

### Key Components
- **Acoustic Models:** Capture the relationship between audio signals and phonetic units.
- **Language Models:** Provide context to predict the most likely words and phrases.
- **Feature Extraction:** Converts raw audio into a format suitable for modeling (e.g., MFCCs).
- **Decoding Algorithms:** Process probabilities from models to generate the final transcription.

### Applications
- **Voice Assistants:** Enabling virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.
- **Transcription Services:** Automatic conversion of spoken language into written text.
- **Accessibility:** Helping people with disabilities interact with technology.
- **Telecommunications:** Enhancing [customer service](../c/customer_service.md) and call center operations.

### Advantages
- Facilitates hands-free operation and accessibility.
- Improves [productivity](../p/productivity.md) by automating transcription and translation.
- Enables natural user interfaces for devices and applications.

### Challenges
- [Variability](../v/variability.md) in accents, dialects, and background [noise](../n/noise.md).
- High computational requirements for real-time processing.
- Maintaining accuracy in diverse acoustic environments.

### Future Outlook
Future research in speech recognition focuses on improving [noise](../n/noise.md) robustness, handling diverse languages and accents, and integrating with [multimodal AI](../m/multimodal_ai.md) systems to create more seamless human-computer interactions.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Speech Recognition and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Speech Recognition as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Speech Recognition, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Speech Recognition. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Speech Recognition alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
