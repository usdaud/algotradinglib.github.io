### Crowdsourced Predictions

Communities on platforms like Reddit (e.g., r/WallStreetBets) have shown how crowdsourced investment ideas can significantly impact [market](../m/market.md) movements. The GameStop [short squeeze](../s/short_squeeze.md) in January 2021 is a prominent example where retail investors coordinated on Reddit to drive up the stock price.
