[Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) involves analyzing text data to understand public opinion about particular [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, or [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

#### Tools and Techniques
- **[Natural Language Processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP)**: NLP algorithms can parse through millions of tweets, comments, and posts to provide insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).
- **[Sentiment Indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md)**: Tools like the Bullish/Bearish sentiment [indicator](../i/indicator.md) evaluate the proportion of positive versus negative sentiment about a specific stock.
- **[Social Media Analytics](../s/social_media_analytics.md) Platforms**: Applications such as Hootsuite or Social Mention aggregate data and provide analytics about trending topics and sentiment.

### Crowdsourced Predictions

Communities on platforms like Reddit (e.g., r/WallStreetBets) have shown how crowdsourced investment ideas can significantly impact [market](../m/market.md) movements. The GameStop [short squeeze](../s/short_squeeze.md) in January 2021 is a prominent example where retail investors coordinated on Reddit to drive up the stock price.

### Real-time News and Updates

Traders can receive real-time news and updates from social media faster than traditional news outlets. Breaking news, [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, and geopolitical events are frequently shared first on platforms like Twitter.
