# Stock Borrow

Stock borrow is the process of obtaining shares to deliver for a short sale. It is similar to short borrow but refers more broadly to the lending and borrowing of stock in securities lending markets.

## Key elements
- Borrow fee or rebate depending on demand and supply.
- Collateral posted by the borrower.
- Recall risk if the lender demands shares back.

## Example
A hedge fund borrows shares to short a company. The borrow fee rises as the stock becomes harder to borrow, reducing expected returns.

## Practical notes
Stock borrow rates can change rapidly. Traders must monitor costs and recall risk, especially in crowded shorts.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Stock Borrow and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Stock Borrow as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Stock Borrow, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Stock Borrow. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Stock Borrow alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
