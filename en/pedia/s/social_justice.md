## Principles of Social Justice

Social justice is built on several key principles that guide efforts to create equitable societies:

### Fairness

Fairness involves ensuring that all individuals have equal access to opportunities and resources. This principle opposes discrimination based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, and other factors.

### Equity

[Equity](../e/equity.md) goes beyond equality by acknowledging that different individuals and communities may need varying levels of support to achieve equal outcomes. It involves distributing resources and opportunities in a manner that addresses these disparities.

### Rights

Protecting individual rights is fundamental to social justice. This includes civil, political, social, economic, and cultural rights. Ensuring these rights allows individuals to participate fully in society.

### Participation

Social justice emphasizes the importance of inclusive participation in decision-making processes. This allows marginalized groups to have a voice and influence policies that affect their lives.

### Access

Access to basic needs such as education, healthcare, housing, and employment is essential for a just society. Social justice advocates for the removal of barriers preventing access to these necessities.

## Key Issues in Social Justice

Several critical issues remain at the forefront of social justice efforts. These include:

### Economic Inequality

Economic inequality refers to the unequal [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) and [income](../i/income.md) within a society. Addressing this [issue](../i/issue.md) involves advocating for policies that promote fair wages, progressive [taxation](../t/taxation.md), and social safety nets.

### Racial Justice

### LGBTQ+ Rights

### Disability Rights

Disability rights aim to ensure that individuals with disabilities have the same opportunities and rights as those without disabilities. This involves accessibility, anti-discrimination laws, and accommodations in education and employment.
