# Spread Betting

Spread betting is a [derivative](../d/derivative.md) strategy, where participants do not own the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) they bet on, such as a stock or [commodity](../c/commodity.md). Instead, they speculate on whether the price of the [asset](../a/asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) rise or fall. The payoff is based on the accuracy of the wager rather than the actual price movement of the [asset](../a/asset.md).

## How Spread Betting Works

When engaging in spread betting, an [investor](../i/investor.md) places a bet on whether the price of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) be above or below a specified level (the "spread") at some point in the future. The bet is on the "spread" between the buy (ask) and sell ([bid](../b/bid.md)) prices quoted by a [broker](../b/broker.md). If the [trader](../t/trader.md) believes the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price [will](../w/will.md) be higher than the spread, they "buy" (go long). If they believe the price [will](../w/will.md) be lower, they "sell" (go short).

The [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss in spread betting is determined by the difference between the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price at the time the bet is closed and the spread. If the [speculation](../s/speculation.md) is correct, the [trader](../t/trader.md) gains a [profit](../p/profit.md) proportional to the amount by which the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price exceeds the spread. If the bet is incorrect, the [trader](../t/trader.md) incurs a loss.

### Example of Spread Betting

Imagine a [trader](../t/trader.md) decides to place a spread bet on the price of gold. The [broker](../b/broker.md) quotes a spread of $1,850 - $1,870 for the price of gold:

- **Buy Price (Ask Price):** $1,870
- **Sell Price ([Bid Price](../b/bid_price.md)):** $1,850

If the [trader](../t/trader.md) believes the price of gold [will](../w/will.md) rise above $1,870, they [will](../w/will.md) buy at $1,870. Conversely, if they think the price [will](../w/will.md) fall below $1,850, they [will](../w/will.md) sell at $1,850.

- **If the [trader](../t/trader.md) buys** and the price of gold rises to $1,900, the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s [profit](../p/profit.md) [will](../w/will.md) be the difference between $1,900 and $1,870:

$$
[Profit](../p/profit.md) = (Closing Price - Spread) × Stake
 = (1,900 - 1,870) × Stake
 = 30 × Stake
$$

- **If the price falls** to $1,800, the [trader](../t/trader.md) incurs a loss:

$$
Loss = (Spread - Closing Price) × Stake
 = (1,870 - 1,800) × Stake
 = 70 × Stake
$$

## Key Features of Spread Betting

### Leverage

Spread betting is often leveraged, meaning traders can bet more than their [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) [deposit](../d/deposit.md). [Leverage](../l/leverage.md) allows for larger positions and potentially higher profits, but also increases the [risk](../r/risk.md) of significant losses.

### Tax Efficiency

In the UK and some other countries, spread betting gains are typically exempt from [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) and stamp duty. However, tax laws can change and may vary by jurisdiction, so traders should consult a tax professional.

### Wide Market Access

Spread betting platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) access to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of markets, including equities, indices, commodities, currencies, and more. This allows traders to diversify and [leverage](../l/leverage.md) opportunities across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

### No Ownership of Underlying Asset

Traders do not own the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) in spread betting, only the contract specifying the bet. This means there are no costs or complexities associated with holding the actual [asset](../a/asset.md), such as [logistics](../l/logistics.md) or storage for commodities.

### Costs and Risks

#### **Bid-Ask Spread**

The primary cost of spread betting stems from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md). The [broker](../b/broker.md) sets a wider spread than the [market](../m/market.md) to incorporate its [profit](../p/profit.md). The spread can vary based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions and the [broker](../b/broker.md)'s policies.

#### **Risk of Losses**

Due to [leverage](../l/leverage.md), traders can lose more [money](../m/money.md) than their initial investment. Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies, such as using [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), are crucial to minimize potential losses.

## Advanced Strategies in Spread Betting

### Hedging

Traders can use spread betting for hedging purposes, especially in volatile markets. For instance, an [investor](../i/investor.md) holding a portfolio of [stocks](../s/stock.md) can place a spread bet against a falling [market](../m/market.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) potential losses in the portfolio.

### Pair Trading

This strategy involves simultaneously betting on the spread between two correlated assets. Traders buy (bet) on the [asset](../a/asset.md) expected to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) and sell (short) the underperforming [asset](../a/asset.md). The goal is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the relative movement between the two assets, regardless of the overall [market](../m/market.md) direction.

### Trend Following

[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is a strategy where traders identify and bet according to the prevailing [market](../m/market.md) [trend](../t/trend.md). By using [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), such as moving averages, traders aim to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the [momentum](../m/momentum.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) price movements.

### Scalping

[Scalping](../s/scalping.md) is a high-frequency [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) where traders make numerous small bets on short-term price movements. This requires quick decision-making and minimal [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) to be effective.

## Conclusion

Spread betting provides traders with a flexible and tax-efficient means to speculate on [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) without owning the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. The ability to go long or short, [leverage](../l/leverage.md) positions, and access a wide [range](../r/range.md) of markets makes spread betting an attractive option for both amateur and seasoned traders. However, the risks associated with leveraged trading underscore the importance of careful strategy, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and the use of [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md). As the landscape of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) continues to evolve, spread betting remains a versatile and dynamic tool for traders seeking to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations.
