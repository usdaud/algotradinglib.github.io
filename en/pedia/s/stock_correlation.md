# Stock Correlation

Stock correlation measures how two stocks move relative to each other. Positive correlation means they tend to move in the same direction, while negative correlation means they move in opposite directions.

## Calculation
Correlation is typically measured using a coefficient between -1 and 1 based on historical returns.

## Example
Two stocks in the same industry have a correlation of 0.8, indicating they often move together. A trader may avoid treating them as independent positions.

## Practical notes
Correlations can change over time. They tend to rise during market stress, reducing diversification benefits.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Stock Correlation and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Stock Correlation as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Stock Correlation, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Stock Correlation. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Stock Correlation alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
