# Swap

A swap is a [derivative](../d/derivative.md) [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) in which two parties agree to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) cash flows or other financial instruments over a specified period of time. Swaps are widely used to manage [risk](../r/risk.md), speculate, or achieve a desired financial position. They are commonly utilized in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) for hedging, [income](../i/income.md) generation, and achieving more favorable [loan](../l/loan.md) terms.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

## Types of Swaps

Swaps come in various forms, with the most common ones being:

### 1. Interest Rate Swaps

[Interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) are the most widely known type of swap. In an [interest rate swap](../i/interest_rate_swap.md), two parties agree to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) payments on a specified [principal](../p/principal.md) amount (notional [principal](../p/principal.md)) over a certain period. There are two main forms of [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md):

- **Fixed-for-Floating Swaps:** In this type, one party pays a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) while the other pays a [floating interest rate](../f/floating_interest_rate.md), typically based on a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) like LIBOR. This kind of swap is often used by companies to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations.
- **Floating-for-Floating Swaps ([Basis](../b/basis.md) Swaps):** Both parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) different floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. These swaps usually occur between two different floating benchmarks.

### 2. Currency Swaps

[Currency](../c/currency.md) swaps involve the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in one [currency](../c/currency.md) for [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in another [currency](../c/currency.md). These swaps are used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) fluctuations, engage in [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), or facilitate loans in foreign currencies.

- **Fixed-for-Floating [Currency](../c/currency.md) Swaps:** This involves exchanging fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in one [currency](../c/currency.md) for floating [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in another [currency](../c/currency.md).
- **Fixed-for-Fixed [Currency](../c/currency.md) Swaps:** Both parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments but in different currencies.
- **Floating-for-Floating [Currency](../c/currency.md) Swaps:** Both parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) floating [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in different currencies.

### 3. Commodity Swaps

[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) swaps involve the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of cash flows based on the price of a [commodity](../c/commodity.md), such as oil, gold, or agricultural products. They are often used by producers and consumers of commodities to manage price [risk](../r/risk.md).

- **Fixed-for-Floating [Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Swaps:** One party pays a fixed price for the [commodity](../c/commodity.md), while the other pays a price that fluctuates based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### 4. Equity Swaps

[Equity](../e/equity.md) swaps involve the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of cash flows based on the performance of an [equity](../e/equity.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) or individual [stocks](../s/stock.md). They provide a way to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to [equity](../e/equity.md) markets without directly owning the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md).

- **[Total Return](../t/total_return.md) Swaps:** One party receives the [total return](../t/total_return.md) on an [equity](../e/equity.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) or individual stock, including dividends and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, while the other party pays a fixed or floating rate.

### 5. Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

A [credit](../c/credit.md) [default](../d/default.md) swap is a contract in which one party pays a periodic [fee](../f/fee.md) in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for compensation in the event of a [default](../d/default.md) or [credit](../c/credit.md) event related to a specified reference entity (such as a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) or government). CDS are used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) or to speculate on the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the reference entity.

## Mechanics of a Swap

Swaps generally involve the following key components:

- **Notional [Principal](../p/principal.md):** The amount on which the exchanged cash flows are based, also known as the notional amount. This amount is typically not exchanged between the parties and serves only as a reference for calculating payments.
- **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Dates:** The specific dates on which the cash flows are exchanged.
- **[Maturity Date](../m/maturity_date.md):** The final date on which the last [payment](../p/payment.md) is made, and the swap contract concludes.
- **Fixed Rate or Price:** In fixed-for-floating swaps, this is the predetermined rate or price agreed upon by the parties.
- **Floating Rate or Price:** In floating-for-floating swaps, this is the rate or price that changes based on an agreed-upon [index](../i/index_instrument.md) or [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

## Applications of Swaps

### 1. Risk Management

Swaps are commonly used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) various types of financial risks. For example:

- **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md):** Companies with floating-rate [debt](../d/debt.md) might use [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) floating payments for fixed payments, thereby locking in predictable [interest](../i/interest.md) costs.
- **[Currency](../c/currency.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md):** Firms with exposure to foreign currencies can use [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps to manage [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) fluctuations.
- **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Price [Risk](../r/risk.md):** Producers or consumers of commodities can use swaps to stabilize cash flows by locking in prices.

### 2. Speculation

Investors may use swaps to speculate on movements in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices, or the performance of [equity](../e/equity.md) indices. Speculative use of swaps can potentially [offer](../o/offer.md) high rewards but also comes with significant [risk](../r/risk.md).

### 3. Arbitrage

[Arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md) arise when there is a price discrepancy between different markets. Traders can use swaps to exploit these discrepancies and earn a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md). For example, in [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps, an [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md) might lock in a favorable [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) difference between two currencies.

### 4. Achieving Desired Financial Positions

Swaps can help entities align their financial positions with their goals. For example, a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) with [debt](../d/debt.md) in one [currency](../c/currency.md) but [revenue](../r/revenue.md) in another might use a [currency swap](../c/currency_swap.md) to better match its cash flows.

## Key Considerations and Risks

### 1. Counterparty Risk

The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the other party in the swap agreement may [default](../d/default.md) on their [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This [risk](../r/risk.md) is particularly significant in OTC (Over-The-Counter) swaps, where there is no centralized clearinghouse.

### 2. Market Risk

The [risk](../r/risk.md) of adverse movements in [market](../m/market.md) variables such as [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices, which can impact the [value](../v/value.md) of the swap.

### 3. Liquidity Risk

The [risk](../r/risk.md) that a party may not be able to easily exit or [offset](../o/offset.md) the swap position due to a lack of [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### 4. Legal and Regulatory Risk

Swaps are subject to legal and regulatory oversight, which can vary by jurisdiction. Regulatory changes can impact the terms, reporting requirements, and overall attractiveness of swaps.

### 5. Complexity and Valuation

Swaps can be complex financial instruments, and their [valuation](../v/valuation.md) often requires sophisticated modeling and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools. Misvaluation or misunderstanding of the terms can lead to significant financial losses.

## Conclusion

Swaps are versatile financial instruments that play a pivotal role in modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). They provide essential tools for managing [risk](../r/risk.md), achieving financial goals, and facilitating [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md). However, their complexity and associated risks necessitate careful consideration and [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices by those who utilize them. For those looking to delve deeper into the world of swaps, comprehensive resources and expert advice can be invaluable in navigating this intricate landscape.
