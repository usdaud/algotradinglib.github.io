# Share Price Analysis

Share price analysis is a critical aspect of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). It involves the study and interpretation of a company's stock price movements and their [underlying](../u/underlying.md) factors. Share prices are influenced by numerous variables, including [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), and company performance. For investors and traders, understanding these factors is essential for making informed decisions. This document delves into various aspects and methodologies of share price analysis, including fundamental and [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), [sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md), [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), and the role of modern technologies in share price prediction.

## Fundamental Analysis

[Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) involves evaluating a company's [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Investors who use [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) aim to produce a quantitative estimate of a company's stock price based on its [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), and [industry](../i/industry.md) conditions.

### Key Components of Fundamental Analysis

1. **[Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md)**
    - **[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md)**: This summarizes a company's revenues and expenses over a period, reflecting profitability.
    - **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md)**: This outlines a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) at a specific point in time.
    - **[Cash Flow Statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md)**: This provides a summary of [money](../m/money.md) flowing in and out of the [business](../b/business.md).

2. **Ratios**
    - **Price-to-[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (P/E) Ratio**: This measures the current share price relative to per-share [earnings](../e/earnings.md).
    - **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: This compares the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of a company to its [book value](../b/book_value.md).
    - **[Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Equity](../e/equity.md) (D/E) Ratio**: This indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) used to [finance](../f/finance.md) a company's assets.

3. **Qualitative Factors**
    - **Management Competence**
    - **[Industry](../i/industry.md) Position and Competition**
    - **Economic and [Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**

## Technical Analysis

[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) evaluates securities by analyzing [statistics](../s/statistics.md) generated by [market](../m/market.md) activity, such as past prices and [volume](../v/volume.md). Unlike [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) doesn't attempt to measure a company's [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md). Instead, it uses charts and other tools to identify patterns that can suggest future [market](../m/market.md) behavior.

### Key Tools in Technical Analysis

1. **Charts** 
    - **Line Charts**: Show the closing prices over a period.
    - **Bar Charts**: Provide more detail, including opening, high, low, and closing prices.
    - **[Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) Charts**: Show the same data as bar charts but in a more detailed format.

2. **Indicators**
    - **Moving Averages**: Smooth out price data to identify the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md).
    - **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI)**: Measures the speed and change of price movements.
    - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md))**: Shows the relationship between two moving averages.

3. **Patterns**
    - **Head and Shoulders**
    - **[Double Top](../d/double_top.md) and Bottom**
    - **Triangles and Flags**

## Sentiment Analysis

[Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) involves gauging the [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), which refers to the prevailing attitudes of investors toward a particular [security](../s/security.md) or the [market](../m/market.md) as a whole. [Market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) can drive prices, often leading to [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies.

### Methods of Sentiment Analysis

1. **News and Media Analysis**: Analyzing the tone and [volume](../v/volume.md) of news stories.
2. **[Social Media](../s/social_media.md) Analysis**: Assessing posts on platforms like Twitter or forums.
3. **Survey Data**: Gathering data from [investor](../i/investor.md) [sentiment surveys](../s/sentiment_surveys.md).

### Tools for Sentiment Analysis

- **Lexical Analysis Tools**: Identify positive or negative words.
- **[Natural Language Processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP)**: Technology that helps in sentiment extraction from large volumes of text.

## Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) uses computer algorithms to manage trading decisions. Algorithms can execute orders, decide on aspects such as timing and price, and manage a portfolio.

### Types of Algorithmic Trading Strategies

1. **[Trend](../t/trend.md)-following Strategies**: These are based on moving averages or breakouts.
2. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Exploiting price differences in different markets or securities.
3. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Assumes that the price [will](../w/will.md) revert to its historical mean.
4. **[Market](../m/market.md) Making**: Provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by simultaneously [offering](../o/offering.md) buy and sell quotes.
