# Smart Order Routing (SOR)

Smart order routing is the process of automatically sending orders to different venues to achieve the best execution. The router considers price, liquidity, fees, and speed.

## How it works
- The system scans available venues for quotes and depth.
- Orders are split or routed to the best venues.
- The routing logic updates in real time as conditions change.

## Example
A buy order is split across two exchanges to access lower offers and reduce market impact. The router selects venues based on fill probability and fees.

## Practical notes
SOR improves execution but adds complexity. Traders should understand how their broker routes orders and how it handles venue fees and rebates.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Smart Order Routing (SOR) and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Smart Order Routing (SOR) as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Smart Order Routing (SOR), confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Smart Order Routing (SOR). Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Smart Order Routing (SOR) alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
