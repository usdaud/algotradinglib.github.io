# Stop Hunt

A stop hunt refers to a price move that appears to target clustered stop orders. The market briefly pushes through a level to trigger stops, then reverses.

## How it is described
- Price dips below a known support level with many stop orders.
- Stops are triggered, creating a burst of selling.
- Price quickly reverses back into the range.

## Example
A stock trades above 50 for days. It briefly dips to 49.50, triggers stops, then returns above 50. Traders describe this as a stop hunt.

## Practical notes
Whether stop hunts are intentional or just liquidity events is debated. Traders use confirmation to avoid overreacting to brief spikes.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Stop Hunt and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Stop Hunt as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Stop Hunt, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Stop Hunt. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Stop Hunt alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
