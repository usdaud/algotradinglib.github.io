# Social Security

Social [Security](../s/security.md) is a government program that provides economic assistance to people with an inadequate or no [income](../i/income.md). In terms of the United States, it is a federal program designed to provide financial support for retirees, disabled individuals, and survivors. Social [Security](../s/security.md) serves as a social [insurance](../i/insurance.md) program that pools contributions from workers (via [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md)) to provide [income](../i/income.md) to beneficiaries under specified conditions.

## Origins and History

The Social [Security](../s/security.md) program was established in 1935 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's [New Deal](../n/new_deal.md) legislation. The Social [Security](../s/security.md) Act was a response to the economic hardships of the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md), aiming to provide a financial safety net for those unable to work or support themselves. The program initially covered retirees, and later expanded to include survivors' benefits, [disability insurance](../d/disability_insurance.md), and [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) (Medicare).

## How Social Security Works

Social [Security](../s/security.md) is funded primarily through [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) collected under the Federal [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Contributions Act (FICA) and the [Self-Employment](../s/self-employment.md) Contributions Act (SECA). Employers and employees each pay 6.2% of wages (up to a certain limit, known as the taxable maximum), while self-employed individuals pay 12.4%.

### Social Security Numbers

A critical element of the system is the Social [Security](../s/security.md) number (SSN), which is issued to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary working residents. This number is used to track individuals' [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and calculate benefits.

### Calculating Benefits

Once an individual becomes eligible to receive benefits (typically at age 62, with full retirement age varying based on birth year), the Social [Security](../s/security.md) Administration (SSA) calculates their benefit amount based on their lifetime [earnings](../e/earnings.md). The primary [insurance](../i/insurance.md) amount (PIA) is determined by averaging the highest-earning 35 years after adjusting for wage [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Types of Benefits

1. **Retirement Benefits**: Monthly payments for individuals who have reached a certain age and have paid into the system through [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
2. **Disability Benefits (SSDI)**: Financial support for individuals who cannot work due to a qualifying disability.
3. **Survivor Benefits**: Payments to family members (spouse, children, and dependent parents) of deceased workers who qualified for benefits.
4. **Supplemental [Security](../s/security.md) [Income](../i/income.md) (SSI)**: Needs-based program providing financial assistance to elderly, blind, or disabled individuals with low [income](../i/income.md) and resources.

## Funding and Sustainability

Social [Security](../s/security.md) is a pay-as-you-go system, meaning current workers' [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) present beneficiaries. Over the years, concerns have arisen about the program's long-term sustainability due to demographic shifts, such as the aging baby boomer generation and increasing [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md).

### Social Security Trust Funds

The Social [Security](../s/security.md) system consists of two [trust](../t/trust.md) funds:
- **Old-Age and Survivors [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) (OASI) [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md)**
- **[Disability Insurance](../d/disability_insurance.md) (DI) [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md)**

These funds ensure that benefits can continue to be paid even when current tax revenues fall short of [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Financial Challenges

The [solvency](../s/solvency.md) of Social [Security](../s/security.md) is a topic of ongoing debate. According to the SSA's trustees' annual reports, the [trust](../t/trust.md) funds are projected to be depleted in the coming decades if reforms are not enacted. Potential solutions include:

- Increasing [payroll tax](../p/payroll_tax.md) rates.
- Raising the taxable maximum.
- Reducing benefits.
- Raising the retirement age.
- Implementing a combination of these measures.

## Social Security and Inflation

Social [Security](../s/security.md) benefits are adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). These cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) aim to preserve the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of beneficiaries in the face of [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

## Social Security and the Economy

The Social [Security](../s/security.md) program has significant macroeconomic impacts, including:
- **Consumption Patterns**: Beneficiaries tend to spend a large proportion of their benefits, stimulating economic activity.
- **Savings and Investment**: The program affects individuals' saving strategies, often providing a [baseline](../b/baseline.md) of secure [income](../i/income.md) in retirement.
- **[Labor Market](../l/labor_market.md) Participation**: Retirement benefits can influence when people choose to exit the workforce, impacting labor [supply](../s/supply.md).

## Modern Challenges and Reforms

In light of changing [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and demographic trends, policymakers are continuously exploring ways to reform Social [Security](../s/security.md) to ensure its long-term viability. Recent debates have included:
- **[Privatization](../p/privatization.md)**: Proposals to allow individuals to invest a portion of their [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) in private accounts.
- **Means Testing**: Adjusting benefits based on recipients' other sources of [income](../i/income.md) or [wealth](../w/wealth.md).
- **Benefit Formula Adjustments**: Modifying how benefits are calculated, such as altering the PIA formula or adjusting COLAs.

## Conclusion

Social [Security](../s/security.md) remains a cornerstone of the American social safety net, providing critical financial support to millions of retirees, disabled individuals, and survivors. While it faces financial challenges, its foundational role in reducing [poverty](../p/poverty.md) and providing economic [security](../s/security.md) underscores its importance. Ensuring the program's long-term sustainability [will](../w/will.md) require thoughtful policy reforms and bipartisan cooperation.
