# Tick Value

Tick value is the monetary value of the smallest price movement in a contract. It is critical for risk calculations in futures and other derivatives.

## Example
A futures contract has a tick size of 0.25 and a tick value of 12.50. A 1 point move equals four ticks, or 50 in profit or loss.

## Practical notes
Tick value differs by contract. Traders must know it to size positions and set stops properly.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Tick Value and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Tick Value as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Tick Value, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Tick Value. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Tick Value alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
