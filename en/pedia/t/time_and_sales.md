# Time And Sales

Time and sales is a data feed that lists individual trades as they occur. It shows the time, price, and size of each trade, and is often called the tape.

## Uses
- Tracking real time order flow.
- Identifying large trades or sweeps.
- Confirming momentum with trade activity.

## Example
A trader watches the tape and sees a series of large trades executing at the ask, suggesting aggressive buying.

## Practical notes
Time and sales data can be fast and noisy. It is best used with context such as level two data or higher timeframe trends.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Time And Sales and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Time And Sales as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Time And Sales, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Time And Sales. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Time And Sales alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
