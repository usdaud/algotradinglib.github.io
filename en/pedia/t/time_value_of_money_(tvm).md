# Time Value of Money (TVM)

The [Time Value](../t/time_value.md) of [Money](../m/money.md) (TVM) is a financial concept that states that a sum of [money](../m/money.md) has a different [value](../v/value.md) at different points in time. The fundamental principle behind the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md) is that [money](../m/money.md) you have now is worth more than the identical sum in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of [finance](../f/finance.md) holds that, provided [money](../m/money.md) can earn [interest](../i/interest.md), any amount of [money](../m/money.md) is worth more the sooner it is received.

TVM is a central concept in [finance](../f/finance.md) and underpins various other financial theories and calculations, including investment [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) techniques such as Net [Present Value](../p/present_value.md) (NPV), Internal [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (IRR), and [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md). It's used to compare investment alternatives and to solve problems involving loans, mortgages, leases, savings, and annuities.

The main components for calculating TVM are:

1. **[Present Value](../p/present_value.md) (PV):** The current [value](../v/value.md) of a future sum of [money](../m/money.md) or a stream of cash flows given a specified [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md).
2. **Future [Value](../v/value.md) (FV):** The [value](../v/value.md) of a current [asset](../a/asset.md) at a future date based on an assumed rate of growth.
3. **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) (r):** The percentage at which [money](../m/money.md) grows per period.
4. **Number of Periods (n):** The number of [compounding](../c/compounding.md) periods.
5. **Payments (PMT):** Series of equal payments or [receipts](../r/receipt.md) that occur at evenly spaced intervals.

### Present Value (PV)

[Present Value](../p/present_value.md) is the current worth of a future sum of [money](../m/money.md) or stream of cash flows given a specified [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md). The [present value](../p/present_value.md) formula is as follows:

\[ PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \]

Where:
- \( PV \) = [Present Value](../p/present_value.md)
- \( FV \) = Future [Value](../v/value.md)
- \( r \) = [Interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) per period
- \( n \) = Number of periods

The concept of [present value](../p/present_value.md) is particularly important in areas such as pension planning, [bond](../b/bond.md) pricing, and investment portfolios, where future returns must be discounted back to the present to determine their [value](../v/value.md) today.

### Future Value (FV)

Future [Value](../v/value.md) is the [value](../v/value.md) of a current [asset](../a/asset.md) at a future date based on an assumed rate of growth. The future [value](../v/value.md) formula is as follows:

\[ FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( FV \) = Future [Value](../v/value.md)
- \( PV \) = [Present Value](../p/present_value.md)
- \( r \) = [Interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) per period
- \( n \) = Number of periods

Future [Value](../v/value.md) is essential in areas like savings and [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), where it's important to estimate what the [value](../v/value.md) of current savings [will](../w/will.md) be at a future point in time.

### Interest Rate (r)

The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is the percentage at which [money](../m/money.md) grows per period. It can be [nominal](../n/nominal.md) or effective, depending on the [compounding](../c/compounding.md) frequency. For instance, an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) of 6% compounded quarterly is different from 6% compounded annually.

\[ r_{\text{eff}} = \left(1 + \frac{r_{\text{nom}}}{n}\right)^n - 1 \]

Where:
- \( r_{\text{eff}} \) = Effective [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md)
- \( r_{\text{nom}} \) = [Nominal interest rate](../n/nominal_interest_rate.md)
- \( n \) = Number of [compounding](../c/compounding.md) periods per year

The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) plays a critical role in determining how investment values grow over time.

### Number of Periods (n)

The number of periods usually refers to the number of [compounding](../c/compounding.md) periods in the context of [interest](../i/interest.md) [compounding](../c/compounding.md). It could be annual, semiannual, quarterly, or monthly.

\[ n = t \times f \]

Where:
- \( n \) = Number of periods
- \( t \) = Time in years
- \( f \) = [Compounding](../c/compounding.md) frequency per year

Understanding the number of periods is crucial for accurate TVM calculations.

### Payments (PMT)

Payments are a series of equal payments or [receipts](../r/receipt.md) that occur at evenly spaced intervals, commonly found in loans, mortgages, and annuities. The PMT formula integrates the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of a series of cash flows:

\[ PV = PMT \times \left(\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}\right) \]

Where:
- \( PMT \) = [Payment](../p/payment.md) per period

### Applications in Financial Instruments

1. **Bonds and [Fixed Income Securities](../f/fixed_income_securities.md)**:
 Present and future [value](../v/value.md) calculations are essential for valuing bonds and understanding the yields they [offer](../o/offer.md). A [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price consists of the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of its future coupon payments and the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the [principal](../p/principal.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

2. **Loans and Mortgages**:
 TVM calculates monthly payments for loans and mortgages, determines the outstanding balance at any point in time, and assesses the total [interest](../i/interest.md) paid over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

3. **Annuities and Perpetuities**:
 An annuity involves a series of equal payments at regular intervals. Calculating the present and future [value](../v/value.md) of annuities helps in [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), where you need to understand the [value](../v/value.md) of periodic payments in today's terms.

4. **Savings and Retirement Plans**:
 Estimations of how much needs to be saved today to meet a future financial goal are based on TVM calculations, considering expected rates of [return](../r/return.md) and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates.

### Normal vs. Annuity Future Value and Present Value

#### Future Value of a Normal Investment

\[ FV_{\text{normal}} = PV \times (1 + r)^n \]

#### Present Value of a Normal Future Cash Flow

\[ PV_{\text{normal}} = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \]

#### Future Value of an Annuity

\[ FV_{\text{annuity}} = PMT \times \left(\frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}\right) \]

#### Present Value of an Annuity

\[ PV_{\text{annuity}} = PMT \times \left(\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}\right) \]

### Practical Usage in Financial Markets

1. **Discounted [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (DCF) Analysis**:
 TVM is the backbone of DCF analysis used for valuing a company, project, or [asset](../a/asset.md). The forecasted cash flows are discounted back to the [present value](../p/present_value.md) using a [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md), typically the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md).

2. **Option Pricing**:
 Models like Black-Scholes for pricing [options](../o/options.md) heavily rely on the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md) to [discount](../d/discount.md) the [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md) to its [present value](../p/present_value.md).

3. **[Capital Budgeting](../c/capital_budgeting.md)**:
 Companies use TVM to evaluate [capital](../c/capital.md) projects through metrics like NPV and IRR to decide whether to proceed with new investments.

4. **Performance Measurement**:
 TVM is used in [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md) measurement to calculate returns on investments over different periods, considering the time [factor](../f/factor.md).

### Tools for TVM Calculations

Several tools and software are available for TVM calculations, including traditional financial calculators and modern software solutions:

1. **Financial Calculators**:
 - HP 12C Financial Calculator
 - Texas Instruments BA II Plus

2. **Spreadsheets**:
 - Microsoft Excel offers built-in functions like PV(), FV(), and PMT() for TVM calculations.

3. **Financial Software**:
 - [Financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) applications such as QuickBooks, Intuit, and Peachtree incorporate TVM calculations in budgeting and [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) modules.
