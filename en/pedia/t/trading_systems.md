# Trading Systems

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), often referred to as "algo trading," utilizes automated, pre-programmed trading instructions to execute orders on [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These instructions are based on various criteria, including time, price, and [volume](../v/volume.md). Trading systems are the frameworks that support these automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Key Components of a Trading System

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Data Engine**
    - **Function:** Acquires [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md) to analyze and make trading decisions.
    - **Example Providers:** [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) LP ([bloomberglp.com](https://bloomberg.com)), Thomson [Reuters](../r/reuters.md) ([thomsonreuters.com](https://www.thomsonreuters.com)).
    - **Details:** This engine collects data on [asset](../a/asset.md) prices, volumes, and other pertinent [market](../m/market.md) activities. The timeliness and accuracy of this data are critical.

2. **Strategy Implementation**
    - **Function:** Defines the [trading rules](../t/trading_rules.md) and logic to determine buy and sell signals.
    - **Example Providers:** [QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) ([quantconnect.com](https://www.quantconnect.com)), Algorithmia ([algorithmia.com](https://algorithmia.com)).
    - **Details:** These strategies can [range](../r/range.md) from simple moving averages to complex [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models that predict [market](../m/market.md) movements based on historical data.

3. **[Order](../o/order.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md) Engine**
    - **Function:** Executes trades based on the strategy's output.
    - **Example Providers:** [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) ([interactivebrokers.com](https://www.interactivebrokers.com)), [TradeStation](../t/tradestation.md) ([tradestation.com](https://www.tradestation.com)).
    - **Details:** This component splits orders to minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact and reduce latency. Algorithms like TWAP (Time-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price) and VWAP ([Volume](../v/volume.md)-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price) are commonly used in these engines.

4. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) System**
    - **Function:** Monitors and controls [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure.
    - **Example Providers:** RiskMetrics Group ([riskmetrics.com](https://www.riskmetrics.com)), MSCI ([msci.com](https://www.msci.com)).
    - **Details:** It enforces various types of [risk](../r/risk.md) limits, such as position size limits and [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), to prevent significant losses.

5. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) Module**
    - **Function:** Simulates the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) using historical data to verify its effectiveness.
    - **Example Providers:** MetaTrader ([metatrader.com](https://www.metatrader.com)), [TradeStation](../t/tradestation.md).
    - **Details:** [Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) involves rigorous statistical analysis to measure [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) like [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), [drawdown](../d/drawdown.md), and [return](../r/return.md) on investment.

6. **Connectivity Layer**
    - **Function:** Integrates various systems and ensures smooth data flow.
    - **Example Providers:** FIX Protocol ([fixtrading.org](https://www.fixtrading.org)), APIs from different brokerage platforms.
    - **Details:** This layer enables communication between data providers, exchanges, and internal systems, ensuring low-latency data transfer.

### Popular Trading Strategies

1. **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**
    - Utilizes statistical methods to identify price inefficiencies between related financial instruments.
    - **Example:** [Pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md) involves taking long and short positions in two correlated [stocks](../s/stock.md) when they diverge from their historical price relationship.

2. **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md)**
    - Focuses on identifying and following [market](../m/market.md) trends.
    - **Example:** Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD) uses two moving averages to generate buy and sell signals.

3. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**
    - Based on the idea that prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their mean over time.
    - **Example:** Buying an [asset](../a/asset.md) when its price is significantly below its historical average and selling when it is above.

4. **[Market](../m/market.md) Making**
    - Involves providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by placing buy and sell orders to capture the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md).
    - **Example Companies:** Virtu Financial ([virtu.com](https://www.virtu.com)), Citadel Securities ([citadelsecurities.com](https://www.citadelsecurities.com)).

5. **[Sentiment Analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md)**
    - Utilizes news articles, [social media](../s/social_media.md), and other textual data to gauge [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).
    - **Example Tools:** Dataminr ([dataminr.com](https://www.dataminr.com)), [RavenPack](../r/ravenpack.md) ([ravenpack.com](https://www.ravenpack.com)).

### Technical Infrastructure

1. **Hardware**
    - High-performance computers and low-latency networks are essential for executing trades swiftly.
    - **Example Providers:** Dell ([dell.com](https://www.dell.com)), Cisco ([cisco.com](https://www.cisco.com)).

2. **Software**
    - Custom-built or third-party software solutions often tailored to specific [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
    - **Example Providers:** MetaTrader, [QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md).
    
### Legal and Regulatory Considerations

1. **Compliance**
    - Ensuring adherence to financial regulations.
    - **Example:** The SEC in the United States enforces strict guidelines for [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md).

2. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**
    - Maintaining [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in trading activities to avoid manipulation charges.
    - **Example Rules:** [MIFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) in Europe requires detailed reporting of trading activities to regulators.

### Conclusion

Trading systems in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) are complex, multi-layered frameworks that integrate data [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), strategy development, [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). They [leverage](../l/leverage.md) advanced technology and statistical methods to make trading more efficient, precise, and profitable. Understanding their components and strategies is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) landscape successfully.
