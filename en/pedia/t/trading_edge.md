# Trading Edge

A trading edge is a measurable advantage that gives a strategy a positive expected return over time. It can come from information, execution, or behavioral discipline.

## Sources of edge
- Statistical patterns or anomalies.
- Superior execution and cost control.
- Behavioral discipline and risk management.
- Structural advantages or market access.

## Example
A strategy has a 55 percent win rate with average wins larger than losses. Over many trades this produces a positive expectancy, which is the edge.

## Practical notes
An edge can decay as markets change or as more participants exploit it. Ongoing monitoring and adaptation are required.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Trading Edge and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Trading Edge as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Trading Edge, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Trading Edge. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Trading Edge alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
