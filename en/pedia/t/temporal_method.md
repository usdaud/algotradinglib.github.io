# Temporal Method

The temporal method, also known as the historical rate method, is a technique for translating the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) of a company's foreign operations into its [home](../h/home.md) [currency](../c/currency.md). This method is commonly used by multinational corporations to prepare consolidated [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) that reflect the [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and position of their global operations.

### Overview

In essence, the temporal method focuses on the time at which different items on the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) are measured. By applying different [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates depending on the timing of transactions and the nature of the assets and liabilities, the temporal method aims to present a more accurate and relevant depiction of the company's international financial standing. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with fluctuating [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, which can have a significant impact on a company's financial results.

Under the temporal method, monetary items, such as cash, receivables, and payables, are translated at the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) prevailing on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) date. Non-monetary items, like [inventory](../i/inventory.md) and fixed assets, are translated at the historical [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) in effect when those items were initially recognized. [Income statement](../i/income_statement.md) items are typically translated at the average [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) for the period, but specific transactions are translated at the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) on the date of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) if they are significant.

### Key Concepts

#### Monetary vs. Non-Monetary Items

- **Monetary Items**: These are financial statement elements that represent a fixed amount of foreign [currency](../c/currency.md), such as cash, accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md), accounts payable, and [long-term debt](../l/long-term_debt.md). Under the temporal method, these items are translated at the current [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) as of the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) date.

- **Non-Monetary Items**: These include assets and liabilities that do not have a fixed amount of foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) attached to them, like [inventory](../i/inventory.md), fixed assets, and intangible assets. These are translated at historical [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, meaning the rates in effect when the assets were first acquired or the liabilities were first incurred.

#### Exchange Rates

- **Current Rate**: The [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) prevailing at the end of the reporting period.

- **Historical Rate**: The [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) in effect at the time an [asset](../a/asset.md) or [liability](../l/liability.md) was initially recognized.

- **Average Rate**: An average of the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates over the reporting period, often used for translating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and [expense](../e/expense.md) items.

### Application Steps

1. **Monetary Items Translation**: Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) in effect at the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) date.

2. **Non-Monetary Items Translation**: Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) that was in effect at the time the [asset](../a/asset.md) was acquired or the [liability](../l/liability.md) was created.

3. **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) and [Expense](../e/expense.md) Items Translation**: These items are generally translated using the average [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) for the period, except for significant transactions which are translated at the rate on the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) date.

4. **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Translation**: [Equity](../e/equity.md) items, such as [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) and [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), are translated at historical rates.

5. **Translation Gains and Losses**: Any resulting translation gains or losses are typically reported in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), which can significantly affect the reported net [income](../i/income.md).

### Example

Consider a multinational company with operations in Europe. Assume the [functional currency](../f/functional_currency.md) of the European subsidiary is the [Euro](../e/euro.md) (€). The company needs to translate its [Euro](../e/euro.md)-denominated [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) into US Dollars ($) for [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) into the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md)'s [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

- **Monetary assets** like cash and receivables are translated at the current [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md), say 1 USD = 0.85 EUR, as of the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) date.

- **Non-monetary assets** like equipment purchased at an earlier time are translated at the historical rate, say 1 USD = 0.75 EUR, which was the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) when the equipment was acquired.

- **Revenues and expenses** are translated at the average [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) for the reporting period, for example, 1 USD = 0.80 EUR.

### Impact and Considerations

The temporal method can lead to significant translation gains and losses due to the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates. These gains and losses can affect a company’s [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) as reported in its consolidated [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) in [Earnings](../e/earnings.md)**: Since translation gains and losses are included in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), companies using the temporal method may exhibit greater [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in their reported [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

- **[Economic Exposure](../e/economic_exposure.md)**: The method may not capture the true [economic exposure](../e/economic_exposure.md) of a company's foreign operations to [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). Companies must consider additional [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) to manage this [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Different jurisdictions may have varying regulations regarding the use of the temporal method. Companies must ensure compliance with local [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards and international reporting requirements.

### Conclusion

The temporal method is a vital tool for multinational corporations with foreign operations. It provides a systematic approach for translating [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) into the [home](../h/home.md) [currency](../c/currency.md), considering the timing of transactions and the nature of different financial statement items. While it can introduce [volatility](../v/volatility.md) into reported [earnings](../e/earnings.md), it also offers a nuanced view of a company's [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and position in an international context. Understanding and effectively implementing the temporal method is essential for accurate financial reporting and maintaining regulatory compliance in a globalized [economy](../e/economy.md).
