# Tracking Stock

A tracking stock, also known as a targeted stock or a letter stock, is a type of [equity](../e/equity.md) issuance designed to track the [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) of a specific division, subsidiary, or segment of a company. Tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) allow investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to distinct parts of a large [corporation](../c/corporation.md)’s [business](../b/business.md) without [investing](../i/investing.md) in the company as a whole. The primary purpose of such [stocks](../s/stock.md) is to isolate and reflect the [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) of a single unit, making it easier for investors to evaluate and invest in high-growth segments or spin-offs.

## Overview

Tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) were first introduced in the 1980s as corporations sought innovative ways to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and improve [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md). They are designated by letters appended to the usual [ticker symbol](../t/ticker_symbol.md) of the company's [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). Although the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) still owns the division, the tracking stock is speculated to perform according to the tracked segment’s performance rather than that of the consolidated entity.

For instance, a major [corporation](../c/corporation.md) like Disney (which operates in diversified sectors such as media, entertainment, and more) might [issue](../i/issue.md) a tracking stock specifically for its ESPN segment. This would allow investors interested in sports broadcasting to focus their investments specifically on ESPN's performance rather than Disney’s overall [business](../b/business.md) operations.

## Key Features

### Isolation of Business Segments
Tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) are essentially a financial tool that allows the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) to segregate its diverse [business](../b/business.md) operations into more narrowly focused investment avenues without the need for a formal spinoff or [divestiture](../d/divestiture.md). This tactic is particularly practical for companies with diverse [business models](../b/business_models.md) encompassing [multiple](../m/multiple.md) divisions or product lines that may appeal to different sets of investors.

### Retained Ownership and Control
Despite issuing tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md), the original company retains full control and ownership of the tracked [business](../b/business.md). For investors, this means that the tracked segment remains integrated with the company’s broader structure, and decisions affecting the tracked branch still inherently impact the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md).

### Separate Financial Metrics
The tracked entity’s financial results are reported separately, allowing more precise [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and a clearer [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [business](../b/business.md) units. In reporting [earnings](../e/earnings.md), companies may present comprehensive financial data segmentally, providing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and enabling investors to evaluate tracked unit performance against [industry](../i/industry.md) benchmarks.

### Shareholder Rights and Dividends
Typically, tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) provide limited or restricted voting rights relative to the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md)'s ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md). [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments are usually tied to the performance of the specific [business](../b/business.md) segment, aligning incentives so that stockholders benefit directly from the success of the tracked unit.

### Strategic Uses
Tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility in [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md) and strategic planning. Firms might use them to spotlight high-growth segments, motivate specialized management teams with stock [options](../o/options.md) linked to their specific [business](../b/business.md) outcomes, or even prepare parts of their [business](../b/business.md) for a future [spin-off](../s/spinoff.md).

## Benefits

### Highlighting Business Value
One of the chief benefits of issuing tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) is the ability to highlight the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of high-growth or high-[margin](../m/margin.md) segments. The main company can thereby [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) in parts of its [business](../b/business.md) that may otherwise get [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) within a [conglomerate](../c/conglomerate.md) structure.

### Enhanced Financial Clarity
By delineating financial results by segment, companies provide investors with enhanced [transparency](../t/transparency.md). This clear focus assists in making more informed investment decisions and helps analysts better understand the [value](../v/value.md) contributions of separate operational units.

### Capital Raising
Tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) can also serve as an effective mechanism to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). Investors may be more enticed to invest in a rapidly growing division rather than the company as a whole, enabling the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) to secure funding in a tailored manner suited to bolster specific segment growth.

### Operational Flexibility
Tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) afford operational flexibility, enabling different parts of a company to act with relative autonomy and align internal incentives with [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) linked directly to [business](../b/business.md) outcomes.

## Risks and Limitations

### Market Perception and Volatility
[Market](../m/market.md) perception plays an imperative role in tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md). If the segment underperforms, it can impact [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment, leading to heightened [volatility](../v/volatility.md). The overall reputation of the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) can also be affected by adverse developments in the tracked unit.

### Complex Financial Structures
The complexity of tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) can sometimes obscure financial structures, making it challenging for investors to accurately assess outcomes and predict long-term performance. This complexity may deter some investors due to perceived lack of clarity.

### Limited Shareholder Influence
Tracking stockholders often have limited rights, which can be less appealing compared to holding [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) in the main entity. This restriction might influence the attractiveness of tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md), especially to advocates of [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism.

### Corporate Governance and Strategic Decision-Making
There can be potential conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md) between the main company's management and the tracked segment's [leadership](../l/leadership.md). Decisions favoring the parent entity might not always align with the best interests of the tracking stockholders.

## Examples and Real-World Applications

### Liberty Media
Liberty Media provides a noteworthy example of the use of tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md). The company has issued [multiple](../m/multiple.md) tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) for different segments such as Liberty SiriusXM Group, Formula One Group, and Liberty Braves Group, allowing investors to target investment specifically towards these indicative segments who have varying growth trajectories and [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md).

### EDS (Electronic Data Systems)
In 1996, General Motors (GM) used tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) for its Electronic Data Systems (EDS) subsidiary. By isolating investors’ exposure to EDS, GM could more readily attract investment towards the [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) technology services sector without divesting its stake in the company.

### Dell’s VMware
Dell Technologies tracked VMware through a tracking stock after acquiring EMC in 2016. VMware continued to reflect in its separate financial metrics and [market](../m/market.md) performance, [offering](../o/offering.md) [specialization](../s/specialization.md) and focus to investors keen on [cloud computing](../c/cloud_computing_in_trading.md) and virtualization technologies.

### Liberty Media Group

## Conclusion

Tracking [stocks](../s/stock.md) represent an innovative [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) empowering corporations to segment their [business](../b/business.md) divisions and attract [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) in specific areas of operations. [Offering](../o/offering.md) benefits in enhanced financial clarity, [capital](../c/capital.md) raising, and operational flexibility, they enable investors to align their investments more precisely with successful [business](../b/business.md) units. However, they also carry distinct risks, including increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md), limited [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) influence, and potential internal management conflicts. Despite these challenges, they continue to serve as strategic tools in modern [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), particularly in sectors characterized by dynamic growth and [diversification](../d/diversification.md).
