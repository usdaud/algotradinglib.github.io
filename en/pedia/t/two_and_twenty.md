# Two and Twenty

## Introduction

The term "Two and Twenty" refers to a common [fee](../f/fee.md) structure used by [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) firms, and certain other [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) companies. It is a compensation scheme that charges both a [management fee](../m/management_fee.md) and a performance [fee](../f/fee.md). Specifically, it encompasses a 2% annual [management fee](../m/management_fee.md) on assets under management (AUM) and a 20% performance [fee](../f/fee.md) on profits earned above a predetermined [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) or [hurdle rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md).

## Detailed Breakdown

### Management Fee

#### What is a Management Fee?

The [management fee](../m/management_fee.md) is a flat [fee](../f/fee.md) calculated as a percentage of assets under management. In the "Two and Twenty" structure, this is set at 2%. The [fee](../f/fee.md) is intended to cover the operational and administrative costs of managing the [fund](../f/fund.md), including salaries, technology, [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), and other overheads.

#### How is it Calculated?

The [management fee](../m/management_fee.md) is typically calculated on an annual [basis](../b/basis.md), but it can be charged quarterly or monthly as well. Here is the basic formula:

\[
\text{[Management Fee](../m/management_fee.md)} = \text{AUM} \times 0.02
\]

For example, if a [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) manages $100 million in assets, the annual [management fee](../m/management_fee.md) would be:

\[
\$100,000,000 \times 0.02 = \$2,000,000
\]

### Performance Fee

#### What is a Performance Fee?

The performance [fee](../f/fee.md) is a charge collected as a percentage of the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s profits. In the "Two and Twenty" model, this is set at 20%. The [fee](../f/fee.md) is intended to align the interests of the [fund](../f/fund.md) managers with those of the investors by providing an incentive for managers to achieve high returns.

#### Hurdle Rate and High-Water Mark

The performance [fee](../f/fee.md) usually applies to profits exceeding a certain [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), known as the [hurdle rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md). Additionally, some funds use a [high-water mark](../h/high-water_mark_in_trading.md) to ensure that investors don’t pay performance fees for recovering past losses.

- **[Hurdle Rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md):** The minimum [return](../r/return.md) a [fund](../f/fund.md) must achieve before collecting performance fees. If the [hurdle rate](../h/hurdle_rate_in_trading.md) is 5%, and the [fund](../f/fund.md) returns 10%, the performance [fee](../f/fee.md) applies to the 5% [excess return](../e/excess_return.md).

- **[High-Water Mark](../h/high-water_mark_in_trading.md):** The highest peak in [value](../v/value.md) that a [fund](../f/fund.md) has reached. If the [fund](../f/fund.md) incurs losses, the [high-water mark](../h/high-water_mark_in_trading.md) ensures that performance fees are only charged on net new profits exceeding the previous peak.

#### Calculation Example

Let’s assume a [fund](../f/fund.md) has an initial investment of $10 million and a [high-water mark](../h/high-water_mark_in_trading.md) set at $10 million. After one year, the [fund](../f/fund.md) grows to $12 million, returning $2 million or 20%.

\[
\text{Performance [Fee](../f/fee.md)} = \text{Profits} \times 0.20 = \$2,000,000 \times 0.20 = \$400,000
\]

The investors’ net [profit](../p/profit.md) after deducting the performance [fee](../f/fee.md) is:

\[
\$2,000,000 - \$400,000 = \$1,600,000
\]

The new [high-water mark](../h/high-water_mark_in_trading.md) would now be $12 million.

## Application in Different Sectors

### Hedge Funds

[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds commonly use the "Two and Twenty" structure. It serves to attract skilled managers and align their incentives with the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s performance.

### Private Equity

[Private equity](../p/private_equity.md) firms also implement this [fee](../f/fee.md) structure, though it may be adapted to accommodate longer investment horizons and different performance measurement metrics.

### Venture Capital

Some [venture capital funds](../v/venture_capital_funds.md) use a similar [fee](../f/fee.md) structure, although adjustments may be made to align with the specific nature of venture investments, which often have more significant [risk](../r/risk.md) and longer time horizons.

## Criticisms and Controversies

While the "Two and Twenty" model is prevalent, it has faced criticism for various reasons:

### Double Dipping

Critics argue that the model allows managers to "double dip," earning substantial fees regardless of [fund](../f/fund.md) performance. The 2% [management fee](../m/management_fee.md) provides a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream, regardless of whether the [fund](../f/fund.md) makes or loses [money](../m/money.md).

### Risk-Taking Incentives

The significant performance [fee](../f/fee.md) can incentivize managers to take excessive risks. Since the managers share in the [upside](../u/upside.md) of any gains but are insulated from losses, they might pursue high-[risk](../r/risk.md) strategies that could endanger investors’ [capital](../c/capital.md).

### Lack of Alignment with Long-term Investors

Critics argue that the annual [fee](../f/fee.md) structure does not align well with the long-term nature of many investments, particularly in [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) and [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md).

### Reduced Net Returns

High fees can significantly reduce net returns for investors. For instance, in a scenario where a [fund](../f/fund.md) returns 10% but charges a 20% performance [fee](../f/fee.md), the net [return](../r/return.md) to investors might be reduced to 8%.

## Alternatives to Two and Twenty

### Performance-Only Fees

Some funds have moved towards performance-only fees, foregoing the fixed [management fee](../m/management_fee.md) to better align with [investor](../i/investor.md) interests.

### Sliding Scale Fees

A sliding scale [fee](../f/fee.md) structure adjusts the management and performance fees based on the magnitude of returns or the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s size.

### Low Flat Fees

Some funds have adopted lower flat fees, such as a "One and Ten" model, where the [management fee](../m/management_fee.md) is 1% and the performance [fee](../f/fee.md) is 10%.

### Hurdle Rates and Longer Lock-in Periods

Incorporating hurdle rates and longer lock-in periods can align incentives better by ensuring that managers are rewarded for genuine outperformance rather than short-term gains.

## Conclusion

The "Two and Twenty" [fee](../f/fee.md) structure has gained widespread adoption across various segments of the financial [industry](../i/industry.md). While it effectively aligns the interests of [fund](../f/fund.md) managers with those of investors, it has faced significant scrutiny for potentially encouraging excessive [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking and creating high barriers for [investor](../i/investor.md) returns. As the investment landscape evolves, innovative [fee](../f/fee.md) structures are being developed to address these critiques, [offering](../o/offering.md) alternative models that aim to create more balanced and fair compensation frameworks. Understanding the implications and mechanics of "Two and Twenty" is essential for investors when evaluating the costs and benefits of [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, [private equity](../p/private_equity.md), and other actively managed investment vehicles.
