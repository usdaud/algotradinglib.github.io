# Tangible Book Value Per Share (TBVPS)

## Introduction to TBVPS

Tangible [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Share (TBVPS) is a financial metric widely used in the domain of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md) to assess the per-share [book value](../b/book_value.md) of a company's [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md). Unlike the traditional [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Share (BVPS), which can include intangible assets such as [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) and patents, TBVPS focuses exclusively on [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md). This can provide investors with a more conservative understanding of a company's net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md).

Essentially, TBVPS calculates the [book value](../b/book_value.md) of a company's physical assets on a per-share [basis](../b/basis.md). This metric is particularly useful in evaluating firms with significant intangible assets or [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md), as it strips these out to present a more realistic picture of a company’s [asset](../a/asset.md) base.

## Definition of TBVPS

TBVPS is defined as the [value](../v/value.md) per share of a company’s [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md), after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for liabilities. The formula for calculating TBVPS is:

\[ \text{TBVPS} = \frac{\text{Total Tangible Assets} - \text{[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)}}{\text{Number of Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md)}} \]

Where:
- **Total [Tangible Assets](../t/tangible_asset.md)**: The sum of all physical or [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) the company owns.
- **[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)**: The sum of all financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) that the company owes to external parties.
- **Number of Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: The total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of the company that are currently held by shareholders.

## Components of TBVPS

### Total Tangible Assets

Total [Tangible Assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) include:
- **Cash and [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md)**: This encompasses the available cash that a company holds and any [short-term investments](../s/short-term_investments.md) that can easily be converted into cash.
- **Receivables**: [Money](../m/money.md) owed to the company from customers or other parties, expected to be received within a short period.
- **Inventories**: The [value](../v/value.md) of goods available for [sale](../s/sale.md).
- **[Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and machinery**: Properties, plants, and equipment (PP&E) that the company uses for its operations.

Exclusions from Total [Tangible Assets](../t/tangible_asset.md):
- **[Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md)**: An [intangible asset](../i/intangible_asset.md) that arises when one company acquires another for a [premium](../p/premium.md) [value](../v/value.md).
- **Patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property**: These assets are intangible and therefore, not included in the tangible [book value](../b/book_value.md).

### Total Liabilities

[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) include:
- **Short-term liabilities**: [Obligations](../o/obligation.md) that are due within one year, such as accounts payable and short-term debts.
- **[Long-term liabilities](../l/long-term_liabilities.md)**: [Obligations](../o/obligation.md) due after one year, including long-term debts and deferred tax liabilities.

### Number of Outstanding Shares

The Number of Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md) refers to the total [shares](../s/shares.md) that are held by shareholders and available for trading. This count can be affected by actions such as stock buybacks or stock splits, so it is essential to use the accurate number for precise TBVPS calculation.

## Example Calculation of TBVPS

Let’s break down an example for better clarity:

Imagine a company ABC Corp has the following financials:
- Total [Tangible Assets](../t/tangible_asset.md): \$50 million
- [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md): \$20 million
- Number of Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md): 10 million

Using the TBVPS formula:
\[ \text{TBVPS} = \frac{50,000,000 - 20,000,000}{10,000,000} \]
\[ \text{TBVPS} = \frac{30,000,000}{10,000,000} \]
\[ \text{TBVPS} = \$3 \]

Therefore, the Tangible [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Share for ABC Corp is \$3.

## Importance of TBVPS

### Conservative Assessment

TBVPS is considered a more conservative measure compared to other [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metrics as it excludes intangible assets which might not [hold](../h/hold.md) intrinsic resale [value](../v/value.md). This conservatism is particularly valuable for investors seeking to understand the worst-case [liquidation value](../l/liquidation_value.md) of a company.

### Comparison Across Industries

TBVPS can be especially insightful when comparing companies within the same [industry](../i/industry.md), where the proportion of tangible versus intangible assets may vary widely. For example, in [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) industries, [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) like machinery and [inventory](../i/inventory.md) play a crucial role, making TBVPS highly useful. Conversely, technology companies usually have significant intangible assets, thus TBVPS might indicate a lower [valuation](../v/valuation.md) compared to BVPS.

### Avoidance of Overstated Values

TBVPS helps investors avoid overvaluing a company based on inflated intangible assets. This is crucial during economic downturns or [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) periods where intangible assets might not fetch the anticipated [market value](../m/market_value.md). Financial institutions, for this reason, may use TBVPS in [stress testing](../s/stress_testing.md) and evaluations.

### Better Indicator for Banks and Financial Institutions

For banks and financial institutions, TBVPS serves as a reliable measure due to their significant holding of physical and [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets over intangibles. Regulatory bodies and investors often review the TBVPS metrics for banks to gauge their fundamental [value](../v/value.md) without the distortion by intangible assets.

## Limitations of TBVPS

### Ignoring Intangible Assets

Though the exclusion of intangible assets assures a conservative [valuation](../v/valuation.md), it also means that certain genuine [value](../v/value.md)-driving components of a company are left out. For instance, a technology company's patents, despite being intangible, may [hold](../h/hold.md) substantial future [value](../v/value.md) that TBVPS would not account for.

### Historical Cost Basis

Like any metric hinged on [book value](../b/book_value.md), TBVPS is based on historical costs. This may not reflect the current fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md), especially in an inflationary environment or in cases where the company holds old but appreciated [real estate](../r/real_estate.md).

### Lack of Universality

TBVPS may not be the best [proxy](../p/proxy.md) in industries primarily driven by intangible assets—such as software or biotech firms. The reliance on [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) for [valuation](../v/valuation.md) in these sectors might lead to undervaluation, missing the broader picture of their [market](../m/market.md) potential and future [earnings](../e/earnings.md) capability.

## Tangible Book Value vs. Other Metrics

### Tangible Book Value vs. Market Value

[Market Value](../m/market_value.md), or [Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), represents the total dollar [market value](../m/market_value.md) of a company's outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md). It is the product of the current stock price and the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md). TBVPS provides a floor [value](../v/value.md) in the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), whereas [Market Value](../m/market_value.md) reflects the current [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment and future growth prospects.

### Tangible Book Value vs. Price to Book (P/B) Ratio

While the P/B ratio uses the traditional [book value](../b/book_value.md) in its calculation, TBVPS can provide a more [asset](../a/asset.md)-centric version of the ratio. P/B ratio with tangible [book value](../b/book_value.md) (known as P/TBV) might be preferred by investors looking for [asset](../a/asset.md)-rich companies. A P/TBV below 1 might indicate that the stock is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) relative to its tangible [asset](../a/asset.md) base, a crucial [factor](../f/factor.md) for [value](../v/value.md) investors.

### Tangible Book Value vs. Enterprise Value (EV)

Enterprise [Value](../v/value.md) (EV) represents the total [value](../v/value.md) of a company, considering its [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), [debt](../d/debt.md), and cash on hand. TBV focuses solely on shareholders’ [equity](../e/equity.md) piece sans any [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) or [debt](../d/debt.md) consideration, often providing a different—not necessarily lower or higher—[valuation](../v/valuation.md) [basis](../b/basis.md) compared to EV.

## Practical Applications of TBVPS

### Investment Strategy

TBVPS is a staple in [value investing](../v/value_investing.md) strategy. Investors following this approach often snag [stocks](../s/stock.md) trading below their tangible [book value](../b/book_value.md), driven by the belief that the [market](../m/market.md) [will](../w/will.md) eventually recognize the unrealized worth of the company’s [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md).

### Due Diligence and Risk Mitigation

Particularly crucial in mergers and acquisitions, TBVPS allows the acquiring company to place a more reliable [valuation](../v/valuation.md) on the target's tangible [asset](../a/asset.md) base, serving as a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against overvaluation arising from overly optimistic projections of [intangible asset](../i/intangible_asset.md) worth.

### Financial Health Assessment

Banks and regulators focus on TBVPS for evaluating [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). A low TBVPS may signal potential issues like excessive [leverage](../l/leverage.md) or poor [asset](../a/asset.md) quality, guiding necessary corrective measures to shore up the tangible [asset](../a/asset.md) base.

## Conclusion

In summary, Tangible [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Share (TBVPS) is a vital financial metric that strips down a company's [value](../v/value.md) to its bare tangible essentials. While it provides a rooted, conservative assessment, ensuring awareness and understanding of its limitations is key to making balanced investment decisions. From [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation to serving as a trustworthy guardrail in acquisitions, TBVPS underpins various facets of [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md), ensuring it remains a pertinent tool in the financial analyst’s arsenal. As always, leveraging TBVPS in concert with other metrics ensures a [robust](../r/robust.md), holistic approach to understanding a company’s [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).
