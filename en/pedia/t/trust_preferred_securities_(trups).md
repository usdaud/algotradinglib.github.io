# Trust Preferred Securities (TruPS)

## Introduction

[Trust](../t/trust.md) [Preferred Securities](../p/preferred_securities.md) (TruPS) are a unique hybrid [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that combines elements of both [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). Created to help financial institutions raise [capital](../c/capital.md), TruPS are particularly complex and often require a deep understanding of both the [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and regulatory environments. This document provides a comprehensive examination of TruPS, focusing on their structure, usage, advantages, risks, and their role in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Definition and Structure

TruPS are financial instruments issued by a [trust](../t/trust.md) sponsored by a financial institution. The [trust](../t/trust.md) typically raises funds by issuing [preferred securities](../p/preferred_securities.md) to investors and then lends the proceeds to the financial institution, which in turn issues junior subordinated debentures back to the [trust](../t/trust.md). These debentures essentially act as the [collateral](../c/collateral.md) for the [preferred securities](../p/preferred_securities.md) issued by the [trust](../t/trust.md).

### Key Characteristics

1. **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**: TruPS usually have long maturities, often around 30 years.
2. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Payments**: Periodic [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments that are typically fixed or floating.
3. **Tax Deductibility**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) payments on the junior subordinated debentures are tax-deductible for the issuing institution.
4. **Subordination**: In the event of [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), TruPS holders stand junior to the institution’s [debt](../d/debt.md) holders but senior to common [equity](../e/equity.md) holders.

## Origins and Regulatory Background

[Trust](../t/trust.md) [Preferred Securities](../p/preferred_securities.md) surged in popularity following regulatory changes that enabled banks to count them as [Tier 1 capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md), which is crucial for regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements. Before the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008, TruPS were commonly used by banks and financial institutions to address [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy requirements set forth by regulatory bodies like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

### Basel Norms Impact

Under [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md) and subsequent [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) regulations, the treatment of TruPS in [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy calculations underwent significant changes. Initially, these instruments were attractive because they allowed institutions to bolster their [Tier 1 capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md) without diluting common [equity](../e/equity.md). However, [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) imposed stricter standards, reducing the attractiveness and regulatory benefits of using TruPS.

## Advantages

### Capital Efficiency

TruPS can be an efficient way for financial institutions to raise long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) without issuing common [equity](../e/equity.md), thereby avoiding [dilution](../d/dilution.md) of existing shareholders.

### Tax Benefits

The [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on the associated junior subordinated debentures is tax-deductible, which can make TruPS cheaper compared to other [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising mechanisms.

### Flexibility

TruPS [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility to issuers in terms of deferring [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, subject to certain conditions, without triggering a [default](../d/default.md).

## Risks and Disadvantages

### Credit Risk

Since TruPS are subordinated to senior [debt](../d/debt.md), they carry higher [credit](../c/credit.md) risks. In the event of the issuing institution’s [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md), TruPS holders may suffer substantial losses.

### Complexity

The structure of TruPS can be complex, involving [multiple](../m/multiple.md) layers of subordination and contingent [payment](../p/payment.md) schedules. This complexity can make them less transparent and harder to [value](../v/value.md) accurately.

### Regulatory Changes

Changes in regulatory treatment of TruPS, such as those brought about by [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), can affect their attractiveness and economic benefit to issuing institutions.

## Role in Financial Markets

### Pre-Crisis Popularity

Before the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008, TruPS were popular tools for financial institutions to meet regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements. The ability to count them as [Tier 1 capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md) made them particularly attractive.

### Post-Crisis Developments

The [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) highlighted several vulnerabilities associated with TruPS. For instance, their subordination and long maturities made them risky and illiquid during periods of [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md). Consequently, regulatory reforms such as [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) sought to limit their use in regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) calculations.

## Market Dynamics and Issuers

### Issuers

Banks and financial institutions are the primary issuers of TruPS. The structures can vary significantly depending on the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)’s specific requirements and regulatory environment.

### Investors

Institutional investors such as pension funds, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds are typical buyers of TruPS, attracted by their higher yields relative to other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities.

## Case Study

One notable example is the issuance of TruPS by AIG (American International Group) prior to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). These instruments played a substantial role in the company’s [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) but became a significant burden during the crisis, illustrating both the advantages and pitfalls of using complex [capital](../c/capital.md) instruments.

## Conclusion

[Trust](../t/trust.md) [Preferred Securities](../p/preferred_securities.md) are a sophisticated [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) combining elements of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). They [offer](../o/offer.md) financial institutions a way to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) efficiently but come with increased complexity and risks. Regulatory changes and [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) greatly affect their attractiveness and usability. Understanding these instruments requires a thorough knowledge of [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), regulatory environments, and their implications in various [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
