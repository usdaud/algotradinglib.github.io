# Tying

## Definition
Tying is a sales practice where a seller conditions the [sale](../s/sale.md) of one product or service (the "tying" product) on the purchase of another separate product or service (the "tied" product).

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Conditional Sale
- The purchase of one product is contingent on buying another
- Often involves a desirable product tied to a less desirable one

### 2. Market Power
- Usually practiced by companies with significant [market power](../m/market_power.md) in the tying product
- Leverages dominance in one [market](../m/market.md) to [gain](../g/gain.md) advantage in another

### 3. Separate Products
- The tying and tied products are distinct
- Could theoretically be sold separately

## Legal and Economic Implications

### 1. Antitrust Concerns
- Often viewed as anti-competitive behavior
- May violate [antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) laws in many jurisdictions

### 2. Market Distortion
- Can artificially increase [market share](../m/market_share.md) for the tied product
- May prevent fair competition in the tied product's [market](../m/market.md)

### 3. Consumer Impact
- Can limit consumer choice
- Potentially forces consumers to buy unwanted products

## Types of Tying Arrangements

1. **Contractual Tying**
 - Explicitly stated in sales agreements
 - Example: Software bundled with specific hardware

2. **Technological Tying**
 - Products designed to work only with specific complementary products
 - Example: Proprietary printer cartridges

3. **Economic Tying**
 - Pricing structures that make separate purchases uneconomical
 - Example: Significant discounts for bundled purchases

## Examples in Finance and Business

1. **Banking Services**
 - Requiring a [checking account](../c/checking_account.md) to get a [loan](../l/loan.md)

2. **Software Licensing**
 - Bundling [multiple](../m/multiple.md) software products in one license

3. **Telecommunications**
 - Bundling internet, phone, and TV services

4. **Franchising**
 - Requiring franchisees to purchase supplies from the franchisor

## Legal Status

### 1. United States
- Generally illegal under the [Sherman Antitrust Act](../s/sherman_antitrust_act.md)
- Subject to rule of reason analysis in some cases

### 2. European Union
- Prohibited under Article 101 of the TFEU
- Can be exempted if it provides economic benefits

### 3. Exceptions
- Some tying arrangements may be allowed if they benefit consumers or promote [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)

## Economic Arguments

### For Tying:
- Can lead to [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md)
- May reduce [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) for consumers
- Can ensure [quality control](../q/quality_control.md) in some cases

### Against Tying:
- Reduces consumer choice
- Can lead to higher prices
- May stifle innovation in tied product markets

## Detection and Enforcement

1. **Regulatory Scrutiny**
 - Monitored by [antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) authorities
 - Often investigated following complaints

2. **Legal Challenges**
 - Can result in lawsuits from competitors or consumers
 - Potential for significant fines and forced [unbundling](../u/unbundling.md)

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Analysis**
 - Economists analyze [market](../m/market.md) impacts
 - Assessment of [market power](../m/market_power.md) and consumer harm

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Tying and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Tying as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Tying, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Tying. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Tying alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
