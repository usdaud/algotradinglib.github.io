# Tying

## Definition
Tying is a sales practice where a seller conditions the [sale](../s/sale.md) of one product or service (the "tying" product) on the purchase of another separate product or service (the "tied" product).

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Conditional Sale
- The purchase of one product is contingent on buying another
- Often involves a desirable product tied to a less desirable one

### 2. Market Power
- Usually practiced by companies with significant [market power](../m/market_power.md) in the tying product
- Leverages dominance in one [market](../m/market.md) to [gain](../g/gain.md) advantage in another

### 3. Separate Products
- The tying and tied products are distinct
- Could theoretically be sold separately

## Legal and Economic Implications

### 1. Antitrust Concerns
- Often viewed as anti-competitive behavior
- May violate [antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) laws in many jurisdictions

### 2. Market Distortion
- Can artificially increase [market share](../m/market_share.md) for the tied product
- May prevent fair competition in the tied product's [market](../m/market.md)

### 3. Consumer Impact
- Can limit consumer choice
- Potentially forces consumers to buy unwanted products

## Types of Tying Arrangements

1. **Contractual Tying**
 - Explicitly stated in sales agreements
 - Example: Software bundled with specific hardware

2. **Technological Tying**
 - Products designed to work only with specific complementary products
 - Example: Proprietary printer cartridges

3. **Economic Tying**
 - Pricing structures that make separate purchases uneconomical
 - Example: Significant discounts for bundled purchases

## Examples in Finance and Business

1. **Banking Services**
 - Requiring a [checking account](../c/checking_account.md) to get a [loan](../l/loan.md)

2. **Software Licensing**
 - Bundling [multiple](../m/multiple.md) software products in one license

3. **Telecommunications**
 - Bundling internet, phone, and TV services

4. **Franchising**
 - Requiring franchisees to purchase supplies from the franchisor

## Legal Status

### 1. United States
- Generally illegal under the [Sherman Antitrust Act](../s/sherman_antitrust_act.md)
- Subject to rule of reason analysis in some cases

### 2. European Union
- Prohibited under Article 101 of the TFEU
- Can be exempted if it provides economic benefits

### 3. Exceptions
- Some tying arrangements may be allowed if they benefit consumers or promote [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)

## Economic Arguments

### For Tying:
- Can lead to [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md)
- May reduce [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) for consumers
- Can ensure [quality control](../q/quality_control.md) in some cases

### Against Tying:
- Reduces consumer choice
- Can lead to higher prices
- May stifle innovation in tied product markets

## Detection and Enforcement

1. **Regulatory Scrutiny**
 - Monitored by [antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) authorities
 - Often investigated following complaints

2. **Legal Challenges**
 - Can result in lawsuits from competitors or consumers
 - Potential for significant fines and forced [unbundling](../u/unbundling.md)

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Analysis**
 - Economists analyze [market](../m/market.md) impacts
 - Assessment of [market power](../m/market_power.md) and consumer harm
