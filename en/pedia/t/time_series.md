# Time Series

A time series is a sequence of data points that are ordered in time. This data can be collected at regular intervals (such as daily, monthly, or annually) or at irregular intervals. [Time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md) is a critical aspect of various fields, including [finance](../f/finance.md), [economics](../e/economics.md), environmental science, engineering, and more. This document delves into the fundamentals and advanced concepts of [time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md), particularly with a focus on its applications in trading and [finance](../f/finance.md).

## Fundamentals of Time Series

### Components of a Time Series

A typical time series can be decomposed into several key components:
1. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Component**: The long-term movement in the series. It represents a persistent, [underlying](../u/underlying.md) direction in the data (upward or downward).
2. **Seasonal Component**: Patterns that repeat at regular intervals, such as days, months, or quarters. This could include higher [retail sales](../r/retail_sales.md) during holiday seasons or increased energy consumption during winters.
3. **Cyclic Component**: Fluctuations occurring over longer periods of time than [seasonality](../s/seasonality.md) but are not of a fixed period. [Economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md), with their [expansion](../e/expansion.md) and contraction phases, are a good example.
4. **Irregular Component**: This includes random [noise](../n/noise.md) and is unpredictable. It accounts for the random variations in the data series.

### Types of Time Series

Time series data can be classified based on frequency and domain:
- **Seasonal Time Series**: Exhibits regular patterns within a year.
- **Non-seasonal Time Series**: Does not show regular intervals.
- **[Univariate Time Series](../u/univariate_time_series.md)**: Consists of single variable observations recorded over time.
- **Multivariate Time Series**: Involves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) variables observed over time.

## Time Series Analysis Methods

### Descriptive Methods

Descriptive analysis involves summarizing and identifying characteristics of time series data.
- **[Trend Analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md)**: Identifies the general direction of the series over time.
- **Seasonal Analysis**: Detects and measures seasonal variations.
- **Causal Analysis**: Examines the cause-effect relationships within the series.

### Statistical Methods

Statistical methods for [time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md) explore [underlying](../u/underlying.md) structures and seek to model data.
- **Autoregressive (AR) Models**: Forecast variable by regressing it on its own past values.
- **Moving Average (MA) Models**: Use past forecast errors for prediction.
- **Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) Models**: Combine both AR and MA models.
- **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Models**: Incorporate differencing to achieve stationarity.
- **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)**: Extends ARIMA by incorporating seasonal differentiation components.
- **[Exponential Smoothing](../e/exponential_smoothing.md)**: Smooths time series data to forecast future values.

### Machine Learning Methods

[Machine Learning](../m/machine_learning.md) (ML) methods have revolutionized [time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md), providing sophisticated approaches for [pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md):
- **Recurrent [Neural Networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) (RNNs)**: Designed for sequential data analysis.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A specialized RNN for capturing long-term dependencies.
- **Convolutional [Neural Networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) (CNNs)**: Effective in identifying local patterns through convolutional layers.

### Applications in Finance and Trading

#### Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), also known as automated trading, refers to using computer algorithms to [trade](../t/trade.md) financial instruments quickly and effectively. [Time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md) plays a significant role in developing these algorithms.
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Utilizes algorithms to execute trades at extremely high speeds. Time series data helps in making split-second decisions.
- **[Pairs Trading](../p/pairs_trading.md)**: Involves trading two co-integrated time series. When the spread diverges from the mean, trades are executed based on statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md).
- **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Identifies securities that deviate significantly from their historical mean. [Time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md) can trigger trades to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the [return](../r/return.md) to the mean.

#### Risk Management

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) involves accurately [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) future price movements and volatilities. Time series models provide the foundation for quantifying [risk](../r/risk.md) using techniques such as:
- **[Value](../v/value.md)-at-[Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR)**: Estimates the potential loss in [value](../v/value.md) of a portfolio.
- **[GARCH Models](../g/garch_models.md)**: Evaluate [volatility](../v/volatility.md) over time to assess [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Copula Models**: Capture dependencies between [multiple](../m/multiple.md) financial instruments.

#### Portfolio Optimization

[Time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md) is used in [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md) to predict future returns and minimize [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **[Markowitz Portfolio Theory](../m/markowitz_portfolio_theory.md)**: Uses [covariance](../c/covariance.md) between assets to construct an efficient portfolio.
- **[Black-Litterman Model](../b/black-litterman_model.md)**: Integrates [investor](../i/investor.md) beliefs with time series data to produce optimal [asset](../a/asset.md) allocations.

## Advanced Time Series Techniques

### Non-linear Modelling

Many real-world time series are non-linear, requiring advanced modelling techniques.
- **Non-linear Autoregressive (NAR) Models**: Capable of modeling complex dynamics by using non-linear terms.
- **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)**: Blend linear and non-linear components for flexible modeling.

### Regime-Switching Models

These models assume different regimes or states, each governed by its own parameters.
- **Markov Switching Models**: Utilize hidden Markov states to model time series with regime changes.
- **Threshold [Autoregressive Models](../a/autoregressive.md) (TAR)**: Switch regimes based on the [value](../v/value.md) of an exogenous variable crossing a threshold.

### Spectral Analysis

[Spectral analysis](../s/spectral_analysis.md) focuses on transforming time series data into frequency domain for detailed examination.
- **Fourier Transform**: Converts time series into constituent sinusoidal components.
- **[Wavelet Transform](../w/wavelet_transform_in_trading.md)**: Analyzes short-term time deviations to identify patterns.

### Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis

Utilizing unstructured text data to inform [time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md).
- **[Sentiment Analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md)**: Extracts [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) from news articles or [social media](../s/social_media.md).
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifies latent themes from large text corpora.

### High-Dimensional Time Series

Dealing with high-dimensional data requires [dimensionality reduction](../d/dimensionality_reduction_in_trading.md).
- **[Principal Component Analysis](../p/principal_component_analysis_(pca).md) (PCA)**: Reduces dimensionality by transforming data to [principal components](../p/principal_components_in_trading.md).
- **Autoencoders**: [Neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) that learn compact data representation.

## Tools and Libraries

Several [software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) and libraries are invaluable for [time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md):
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `sklearn`, `pmdarima`, `prophet`, `[tensorflow](../t/tensorflow.md)`
