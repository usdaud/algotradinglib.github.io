# Trade Confirmation

Trade confirmation is the formal notice that a trade has been executed. It includes details such as price, quantity, time, and settlement terms.

## Why it matters
- Confirms the exact execution terms.
- Provides records for reconciliation and compliance.
- Helps identify errors or mismatches.

## Example
A broker sends a confirmation showing a buy of 1,000 shares at 25.40 executed at 10:15 AM with a T+2 settlement date.

## Practical notes
Traders should review confirmations promptly to detect errors or unauthorized trades.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Trade Confirmation and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Trade Confirmation as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Trade Confirmation, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Trade Confirmation. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Trade Confirmation alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
