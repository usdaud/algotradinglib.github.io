# Trade Idea

A trade idea is a planned trading opportunity based on a hypothesis about price movement. It includes a rationale, entry plan, risk controls, and target.

## Components
- Market context and thesis.
- Entry level and trigger.
- Stop loss and target.
- Position size and time horizon.

## Example
A trader expects a breakout from a consolidation pattern. The trade idea specifies buying above the range with a stop below support and a target based on the range height.

## Practical notes
Writing trade ideas improves discipline and post trade review. Even discretionary traders benefit from documenting the plan.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Trade Idea and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Trade Idea as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Trade Idea, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Trade Idea. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Trade Idea alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
