# Treaty Reinsurance

Treaty [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) is a contractual arrangement commonly used within the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [industry](../i/industry.md) to manage [risk](../r/risk.md). Under such an agreement, an insurer (referred to as the ceding company) and a reinsurer agree that the reinsurer [will](../w/will.md) accept a specific portion of [risk](../r/risk.md) from a defined category of policies issued by the insurer. This arrangement allows for the systematic and large-scale transfer of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) risks from the primary insurer to the reinsurer, providing financial stability and capacity for both parties.

## Definitions and Key Terms

### Ceding Company
The primary insurer that transfers the [risk](../r/risk.md) to the reinsurer. The ceding company underwrites the initial policies and seeks to mitigate its [risk](../r/risk.md) by entering into a [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) treaty.

### Reinsurer
The entity that assumes the specified risks from the ceding company under the [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) treaty. The reinsurer can be either a specialized [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) company or a [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) division within a large [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company.

### Treaty Reinsurance
A method of [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) where an agreement (treaty) is established to cover a class or portfolio of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies rather than individual risks. Treaty [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) contrasts with [facultative reinsurance](../f/facultative_reinsurance.md), where individual risks are ceded and accepted on a case-by-case [basis](../b/basis.md).

### Cession
The act of transferring risks from the ceding company to the reinsurer under the terms of the [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) agreement. The portion of [risk](../r/risk.md) transferred is often determined by a predefined cession rate or quota.

## Types of Treaty Reinsurance

Several types of treaty [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) arrangements exist, each designed to [handle](../h/handle.md) different aspects of [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

### Proportional Treaty Reinsurance
Proportional [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) agreements require the ceding company and the reinsurer to share premiums and losses in a pre-agreed ratio. There are two main types of proportional treaty [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md):

- **[Quota Share Treaty](../q/quota_share_treaty.md)**: The ceding company and the reinsurer share risks and premiums in a fixed percentage. For instance, if the ceding percentage is 60%, the ceding company retains 40% of the premiums and liabilities while the reinsurer assumes 60%.

- **[Surplus](../s/surplus.md) Share Treaty**: Here, the ceding company retains a specific amount of [risk](../r/risk.md) per policy, known as the ceding company’s "retention limit." The reinsurer assumes the remaining [risk](../r/risk.md) for any policy exceeding this retention limit up to specified levels.

### Non-Proportional Treaty Reinsurance
Non-proportional treaties (also known as excess of loss treaties) focus on covering losses that exceed a certain threshold. They provide financial protection against significant losses and help insurers manage catastrophic events. These treaties include:

- **Excess of Loss Treaty**: The reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company for losses exceeding a set threshold up to a maximum limit. This threshold can be applied per event (per occurrence) or in aggregate over a time period (annual aggregate excess).

- **Stop-Loss Treaty**: This arrangement limits the total amount of losses over a specific period, protecting the ceding company from excessive aggregate losses.

## Key Benefits of Treaty Reinsurance

### Risk Diversification
Treaty [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) allows the spread of [risk](../r/risk.md) across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) insurers, mitigating the impact of large loss events on the ceding company. This [diversification](../d/diversification.md) enhances the financial stability of the primary insurer.

### Capital Relief
By transferring [risk](../r/risk.md) to a reinsurer, the ceding company can free up [capital](../c/capital.md) that would otherwise be held to cover potential claims. This [capital](../c/capital.md) can then be utilized for other purposes, such as writing new policies or [investing](../i/investing.md) in [business](../b/business.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

### Enhanced Underwriting Capacity
Reinsurers provide [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) expertise and financial backing, enabling ceding companies to take on higher or more complex risks than they could manage alone. This increases the insurer’s capacity to underwrite a broader [range](../r/range.md) of policies.

### Financial Stability and Predictability
Treaty [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) arrangements provide predictable and stable financial outcomes by capping potential losses and stabilizing cash flows. This predictability is crucial for maintaining [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [solvency](../s/solvency.md).

## Treaty Reinsurance Agreements: Structuring and Negotiation

### Agreement Components
Typical treaty [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) contracts include the following elements:

- **[Scope](../s/scope.md) of Coverage**: Specifies the lines of [business](../b/business.md), geographic regions, and policy types covered by the treaty.
- **Cession Limits**: Defines retention rates, thresholds, and maximum limits for [risk](../r/risk.md) transfer.
- **[Premium](../p/premium.md) Calculation**: Outlines the method for determining the premiums payable to the reinsurer.
- **Loss Sharing and Claims Handling**: Details the process for reporting, evaluating, and settling claims between the ceding company and the reinsurer.
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Sharing**: Describes conditions under which profits are shared between the parties, if applicable.
- **Term and Renewal**: Specifies the [duration](../d/duration.md) of the treaty and conditions for renewal or termination.

### Negotiation Considerations
Negotiating a [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) treaty involves critical considerations such as:

- **Historical Loss Data**: Analyzing past loss experience to set appropriate cession terms and pricing.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Appetite**: Balancing the ceding company’s capability to retain [risk](../r/risk.md) with its desire to transfer [risk](../r/risk.md) for financial stability.
- **Reinsurer’s Financial Strength**: Evaluating the financial stability and [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the reinsurer to ensure their reliability in paying claims.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Considering prevailing [market](../m/market.md) trends, [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) rates, and the availability of [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) capacity.

## Challenges and Limitations

### Model Risk
Estimating appropriate thresholds, retentions, and premiums often involves complex statistical models. Incorrect assumptions or model flaws can lead to suboptimal [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) agreements.

### Counterparty Risk
Reinsurers must honor their financial commitments. Failure by the reinsurer to meet [obligations](../o/obligation.md) due to [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) or other reasons poses a significant [risk](../r/risk.md) to the ceding company.

### Regulatory Compliance
[Reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) agreements must comply with regulatory requirements in both the ceding and reinsurer’s jurisdictions. This includes adherence to [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) norms, and licensing standards.

### Changing Risk Landscapes
Evolving risks such as climate change, cyber threats, and pandemics pose new challenges to traditional [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) models. Reinsurers and ceding companies must continually adapt to emerging risks.
