# Trade Lifecycle

The trade lifecycle describes the stages of a trade from idea generation to exit and review. Managing each stage well improves consistency and risk control.

## Stages
- Idea and analysis.
- Planning and order placement.
- Execution and position management.
- Exit and post trade review.

## Example
A trader forms a thesis, defines entry and exit, executes the order, manages the position with trailing stops, and then reviews performance.

## Practical notes
Documenting the lifecycle helps identify weaknesses in process, such as poor entries or emotional exits.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Trade Lifecycle and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Trade Lifecycle as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Trade Lifecycle, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Trade Lifecycle. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Trade Lifecycle alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
