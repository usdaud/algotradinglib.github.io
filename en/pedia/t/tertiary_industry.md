# Tertiary Industry

The tertiary [industry](../i/industry.md), also known as the [service sector](../s/service_sector.md), is a major category of economic activities that deliver services rather than producing tangible goods. This sector includes a vast array of activities that provide consumer and [business](../b/business.md) services. The tertiary [industry](../i/industry.md) is a fundamental part of any [economy](../e/economy.md), acting as the backbone that supports the primary and secondary industries. It encompasses a wide [range](../r/range.md) of activities including retail, entertainment, financial services, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), education, health care, and many others. Below is a detailed exploration of the tertiary [industry](../i/industry.md).

### Definition and Overview

The tertiary [industry](../i/industry.md) delivers intangible goods and services to consumers and businesses. Unlike the primary [industry](../i/industry.md), which involves the extraction of [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md), and the secondary [industry](../i/industry.md), which focuses on [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) and processing, the tertiary sector is centered on [distribution](../d/distribution.md), consumption, and the [provision](../p/provision.md) of non-material services. This [industry](../i/industry.md) can be further divided into several sub-sectors, including:

- Wholesale and Retail [Trade](../t/trade.md)
- Financial and [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Services
- [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) and Rental Leasing
- Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services
- Educational Services
- Health Care and Social Assistance
- Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation

### Characteristics of the Tertiary Industry

1. **Intangibility**: Services provided are not physical objects and cannot be owned. Unlike manufactured goods which can be stored, services are consumed at the point of delivery.
2. **Inseparability**: The production and consumption of services often occur simultaneously. For example, a [haircut](../h/haircut.md) cannot be provided without the presence of the [customer](../c/customer.md).
3. **Perishability**: Services are perishable and cannot be stored for later use. An empty seat on a flight represents a lost opportunity to sell that service.
4. **Heterogeneity**: Services are highly variable and cannot be mass-produced with the same consistency as products. Quality can differ based on the service provider, [customer](../c/customer.md), and context.

4. **Innovation Hub**: Service industries such as IT and [finance](../f/finance.md) are often at the forefront of technological advancements and innovations.
