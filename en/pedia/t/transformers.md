# Transformers

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture based on attention mechanisms that have revolutionized [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) and many other AI tasks.

### Key Components
- **Attention Mechanism:** Allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input.
- **Self-Attention:** Enables the model to capture relationships within a sequence.
- **Encoder-Decoder Structure:** Commonly used for tasks like translation.
- **Positional Encoding:** Adds information about the [order](../o/order.md) of tokens since transformers do not process data sequentially.

### Applications
- **Language Modeling:** Underpins models like BERT, GPT, and T5.
- **Machine Translation:** Provides high-quality translations between languages.
- **Text Summarization:** Extracts key information from long documents.
- **Question Answering:** Generates accurate responses to complex queries.

### Advantages
- Efficient handling of long-[range](../r/range.md) dependencies in data.
- Scalable to very large datasets and models.
- Enables parallel processing, significantly speeding up training.

### Challenges
- Requires massive amounts of data and computational power.
- Can be resource-intensive in terms of memory and energy consumption.
- The architecture may be prone to generating biased or nonsensical outputs if not properly managed.

### Future Outlook
Transformers continue to be at the forefront of AI research, with ongoing innovations aimed at reducing computational costs and enhancing performance across various tasks.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Transformers and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Transformers as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Transformers, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Transformers. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Transformers alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
