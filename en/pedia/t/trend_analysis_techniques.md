# Trend Analysis Techniques

[Trend analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md) is a critical technique in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), used to identify and predict the direction of [market](../m/market.md) movements. Through various methods, traders and data scientists can [gain](../g/gain.md) insights into [market](../m/market.md) trends to make informed decisions. Here, we delve into some of the most prominent [trend analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md) techniques used in the domain.

## Moving Averages

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)
A Simple Moving Average calculates the average of a selected [range](../r/range.md) of prices, usually closing prices, by the number of periods in that [range](../r/range.md). SMA is calculated by adding the closing prices of a given number of periods and then dividing this total by the number of periods.

```plaintext
SMA = (P1 + P2 + ... + Pn) / n
```

In this formula:
- **P1, P2, ..., Pn** represent the prices for respective periods.
- **n** represents the number of periods.

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Exponential Moving Average is a [weighted](../w/weighted.md) form of the simple moving average that gives greater importance to the most recent data points.

```plaintext
EMA = [P(t) * (2 / (n + 1))] + EMA(y) * [1 - (2 / (n + 1))]
```

In this formula:
- **P(t)** is the price at time t.
- **EMA(y)** is the EMA of the previous day.
- **n** is the smoothing [factor](../f/factor.md).

## Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in a [market](../m/market.md).

```plaintext
RSI = 100 - [100 / (1 + RS)]
RS = Average [Gain](../g/gain.md) / Average Loss
```

In this formula:
- **RS** is the average [gain](../g/gain.md) of up periods during a specified time frame divided by the average loss of down periods.

## Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

MACD is a [trend](../t/trend.md)-following [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a [security](../s/security.md)’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. The result of this calculation is the MACD line.

```plaintext
MACD Line = 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA
Signal Line = 9-day EMA of MACD Line
```

A nine-day EMA of the MACD line, called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which functions as a trigger for buy and sell signals.

## Bollinger Bands

[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) are a type of price [envelope](../e/envelope.md) developed by John Bollinger. The concept behind [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) is to depict [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and indicate [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

- A middle band being an N-period simple moving average (MA)
- An upper band at K times an N-period [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) above the middle band (MA + Kσ)
- A lower band at K times an N-period [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) below the middle band (MA - Kσ)

```plaintext
Upper Band = SMA + ([Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) * 2)
Lower Band = SMA - ([Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) * 2)
```

## Fibonacci Retracement

[Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels are horizontal lines that indicate where [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) are likely to occur based on the Fibonacci sequence. The commonly used ratios are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%.

Calculating [Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) involves taking two extreme points (usually a major peak and [trough](../t/trough.md)) on a stock chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios to create the levels.

## Dow Theory

[Dow Theory](../d/dow_theory.md) is a method of understanding [market](../m/market.md) movements based on the writings of Charles Dow. It essentially involves analyzing [market](../m/market.md) trends from six perspectives:

1. The [market](../m/market.md) discounts everything.
2. The [market](../m/market.md) has three trends: Primary (long-term), secondary (medium-term), and minor trends.
3. Primary trends have three phases: Accumulation, public participation, and [distribution](../d/distribution.md).
4. [Stock market](../s/stock_market.md) averages must confirm each other.
5. [Volume](../v/volume.md) must confirm the [trend](../t/trend.md).
6. Trends persist until a clear [reversal](../r/reversal.md) occurs.

## Ichimoku Cloud

The [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md), also known as Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, is a versatile [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that defines support, resistance, [trend](../t/trend.md) direction, and [momentum](../m/momentum.md). It has five main components:

- **Tenkan-sen (conversion line)**: Average of the highest high and the lowest low over the last 9 periods.
- **Kijun-sen (base line)**: Average of the highest high and lowest low over the last 26 periods.
- **Senkou Span A (leading span A)**: Average of the Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen, plotted 26 periods ahead.
- **Senkou Span B (leading span B)**: Average of the highest high and lowest low over the last 52 periods, plotted 26 periods ahead.
- **Chikou Span (lagging span)**: The closing price plotted 26 periods back.

```plaintext
Tenkan-sen = (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2
Kijun-sen = (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2
Senkou Span A = (Tenkan-sen + Kijun-sen) / 2
Senkou Span B = (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2
Chikou Span = Close plotted 26 periods back
```

## Machine Learning and AI in Trend Analysis

[Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) are increasingly used for [trend analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md) in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). These techniques involve training algorithms on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions.

### Supervised Learning

In [supervised learning](../s/supervised_learning.md), algorithms are trained on a labeled dataset, meaning the input data is paired with output labels. Common algorithms used in [trend analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md) include:

- **[Linear Regression](../l/linear_regression.md)**: Used for predicting numerical values based on linear relationships between variables.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method using [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [decision trees](../d/decision_trees.md) for classification and regression.
- **[Support Vector Machines](../s/support_vector_machines_in_trading.md) (SVM)**: Used for classification tasks, useful in separating one [trend](../t/trend.md) from another.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised [learning algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) work with data that is not labeled and they try to find hidden structures in the data. Techniques such as clustering and [anomaly detection](../a/anomaly_detection.md) fall under this category.

- **[K-Means Clustering](../k/k-means_clustering_in_trading.md)**: Groups data points into k clusters based on feature similarity.
- **[Principal Component Analysis](../p/principal_component_analysis_(pca).md) (PCA)**: Reduces dimensionality of data while preserving variance, useful for visualizing trends.

### Reinforcement Learning

In [reinforcement learning](../r/reinforcement_learning.md), an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

- **[Deep Q-Learning](../d/deep_q-learning.md)**: Uses [deep learning](../d/deep_learning.md) techniques to approximate the Q-[value](../v/value.md) function, which predicts the reward of actions in given states.
- **Policy Gradients**: Directly optimizes the policy function that maps states to actions, used in more complex decision-making problems.

## Sentiment Analysis

[Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) involves analyzing text data from news articles, [social media](../s/social_media.md), and other sources to gauge [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). [Natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP) techniques are commonly used to extract sentiment scores, which can then be incorporated into [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

- **Text Classification**: Using machine [learning algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) to classify text data into sentiment categories (positive, negative, [neutral](../n/neutral.md)).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and categorizes key information (entities) in text.
- **[Sentiment Indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md)**: Aggregates sentiment scores to create indicators reflecting [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).
