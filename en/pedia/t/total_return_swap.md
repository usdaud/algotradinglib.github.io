# Total Return Swap

## Introduction

A [Total Return](../t/total_return.md) [Swap](../s/swap.md) (TRS) is a complex financial [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contract that exchanges the [total return](../t/total_return.md) of one [asset](../a/asset.md) for the [total return](../t/total_return.md) of another. [Total return](../t/total_return.md) essentially means the sum of [capital](../c/capital.md) gains and [income](../i/income.md) generated by an [asset](../a/asset.md), which could be in the form of [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, dividends, or appreciation in [value](../v/value.md). A TRS is typically used by institutional investors, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, and [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to certain assets without actually owning them.

Note: LIBOR publication ended for most tenors after 2023, and markets shifted to risk-free reference rates such as SOFR (USD), SONIA (GBP), and ESTR (EUR).

In a [Total Return](../t/total_return.md) [Swap](../s/swap.md), one party (the '[total return](../t/total_return.md) receiver') receives the [total return](../t/total_return.md) of a specified [asset](../a/asset.md), which generally includes both dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, while the other party (the '[total return](../t/total_return.md) payer') receives a specified [return](../r/return.md), often a fixed or [floating interest rate](../f/floating_interest_rate.md). The [asset](../a/asset.md) in question is often referred to as the "reference [asset](../a/asset.md)" or "[underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)".

## Mechanism of Total Return Swap

[Total Return](../t/total_return.md) Swaps can be structured in various ways, but the basic mechanisms involve:

1. **Reference [Asset](../a/asset.md)**: This is the [asset](../a/asset.md) whose [total return](../t/total_return.md) is being swapped. It could be anything from [equity](../e/equity.md) [shares](../s/shares.md), bonds, mortgages to even a portfolio of loans or any other [asset](../a/asset.md) that generates returns.

2. **[Return](../r/return.md) Payer and [Return](../r/return.md) Receiver**:
 - The [return](../r/return.md) payer agrees to pay the [total return](../t/total_return.md) of the reference [asset](../a/asset.md).
 - The [return](../r/return.md) receiver agrees to pay an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), which can be fixed or floating.

3. **Payments**: The returns (both from the reference [asset](../a/asset.md) and the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments) are swapped periodically. The frequency of these payments can be monthly, quarterly, or annually, as agreed upon in the [swap](../s/swap.md) contract.

4. **Settlement**: At the end of the contract term, the returns are netted out. If the [total return](../t/total_return.md) payer’s obligation exceeds that of the [return](../r/return.md) receiver’s, the payer makes the net [payment](../p/payment.md) to the receiver, and vice versa.

## Example of a Total Return Swap

Imagine a [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) wants to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the returns of a certain stock [index](../i/index_instrument.md) but does not want to actually purchase the [stocks](../s/stock.md) due to regulatory restrictions or other reasons. Instead, they enter into a TRS with an investment [bank](../b/bank.md).

- The [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) ([total return](../t/total_return.md) receiver) [will](../w/will.md) receive returns from the stock [index](../i/index_instrument.md), including both price appreciation and dividends.
- The investment [bank](../b/bank.md) ([total return](../t/total_return.md) payer) [will](../w/will.md) receive periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments from the [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md), often based on a [LIBOR rate](../l/libor_rate_analysis.md) plus a spread.

At the end of each period, if the [total return](../t/total_return.md) from the stock [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is higher than the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, the investment [bank](../b/bank.md) [will](../w/will.md) pay the [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) the difference. If the [total return](../t/total_return.md) is lower, the [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) [will](../w/will.md) pay the investment [bank](../b/bank.md).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages:
1. **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md)**: TRS allow investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to an [asset](../a/asset.md) without the need to commit the full [capital](../c/capital.md) required to purchase the [asset](../a/asset.md) directly.
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: By entering into a TRS, an [investor](../i/investor.md) can achieve the desired exposure without having to deal with the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues.
3. **Flexibility**: TRS can be structured to meet specific needs of the contracting parties, including details on [payment](../p/payment.md) frequency, [duration](../d/duration.md), and types of returns exchanged.

### Disadvantages:
1. **[Counterparty Risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md)**: The [total return](../t/total_return.md) receiver is exposed to the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of the [total return](../t/total_return.md) payer.
2. **Complexity**: The structure and terms of TRS can be complex and may require sophisticated financial understanding and management.
3. **Regulatory Issues**: TRS are often subject to stringent regulations which can vary by jurisdiction.

## Use Cases

1. **[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds**: [Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds often use TRS to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to financial assets without actually holding them, allowing for greater flexibility and more efficient use of [capital](../c/capital.md).
2. **Banks**: Banks may use TRS to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) on loans or other assets they [hold](../h/hold.md) on their balance sheets.
3. **Investment Firms**: These firms may use TRS to temporarily allocate [capital](../c/capital.md) to high-[yield](../y/yield.md) assets without the need for long-term commitments.

## Market and Regulatory Environment

Given the complexity and potential risks associated with TRS, they are closely monitored and regulated by financial authorities. Regulations can vary by country, but often include requirements for [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md), reporting, and adherence to [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy standards.

For instance, in the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act has enhanced regulatory oversight for various [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), including TRS. In Europe, regulations such as EMIR (European [Market](../m/market.md) [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) Regulation) provide guidelines for the [clearing](../c/clearing.md) and reporting of [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contracts.

### Notable Institutions

Several financial institutions are notable for their involvement in the TRS [market](../m/market.md):

- **Goldman Sachs**- **J.P. Morgan**- **Morgan Stanley**
These institutions provide various TRS products and services, facilitating trades and providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the [market](../m/market.md).

## Conclusion

A [Total Return](../t/total_return.md) [Swap](../s/swap.md) serves as a powerful financial tool for those looking to manage or [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the returns of various assets without the need to own the assets outright. While highly beneficial due to the [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and flexibility they [offer](../o/offer.md), TRS also come with risks, particularly related to [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) and regulatory concerns. Therefore, they are chiefly employed by sophisticated investors and institutions that possess a comprehensive understanding of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).
