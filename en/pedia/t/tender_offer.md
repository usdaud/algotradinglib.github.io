# Tender Offer

A [tender](../t/tender.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) is a type of public [takeover](../t/takeover.md) [bid](../b/bid.md), where an [investor](../i/investor.md), often referred to as the "bidder" or "offeror," makes an [offer](../o/offer.md) to purchase some or all of shareholders' [shares](../s/shares.md) in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md). The price offered is typically at a [premium](../p/premium.md) to the current [market price](../m/market_price.md), providing an incentive for shareholders to sell their [holdings](../h/holdings.md). [Tender](../t/tender.md) offers can be hostile or friendly, and they are usually made in an effort to [gain](../g/gain.md) control of a company or to acquire a substantial portion of a company's [equity](../e/equity.md).

## Types of Tender Offers

### 1. **Cash Tender Offer**
Cash [tender](../t/tender.md) offers are the most straightforward type. Here, the bidder offers to pay a specified price in cash for the target company's [shares](../s/shares.md). These offers are commonly used during acquisitions or when an [investor](../i/investor.md) aims to increase their stake in a company.

### 2. **Share Exchange Offer**
In a share [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [offer](../o/offer.md), the bidder offers [shares](../s/shares.md) of their own company in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for [shares](../s/shares.md) of the target company. This type of [offer](../o/offer.md) is commonly seen in mergers and acquisitions where the acquirer does not wish to alter its cash reserves.

### 3. **Mini-Tender Offer**
Mini-[tender](../t/tender.md) offers involve bids to purchase less than 5% of a company's [shares](../s/shares.md). These offers evade many regulatory requirements that apply to larger offers, making them quicker and less costly to execute. However, they pose significant risks to investors due to their less stringent regulatory oversight.

### 4. **Self-Tender Offer**
In a self-[tender](../t/tender.md) [offer](../o/offer.md), the company itself seeks to repurchase its own [shares](../s/shares.md). This can be used as a strategy to [return](../r/return.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) to shareholders, reduce the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), or thwart unwanted [takeover](../t/takeover.md) attempts.

## Regulatory Framework

In the United States, [tender](../t/tender.md) offers are governed by the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md), particularly by Sections 13(e) and 14(d). The regulations require bidders to disclose certain information, such as the [offer](../o/offer.md)'s terms and reasons for the [offer](../o/offer.md), plans following the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), and any financial arrangements or conditions associated with the [offer](../o/offer.md). The [Williams Act](../w/williams_act.md), enacted in 1968, further ensures that investors receive sufficient information to make informed decisions.

### Key Filings and Disclosures:

1. **Schedule TO ([Tender](../t/tender.md) [Offer](../o/offer.md) Statement under Section 14(d)(1))**:
 The bidder must file this document with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC), detailing the [offer](../o/offer.md) terms, purpose, and financial considerations.

2. **[Schedule 13D](../s/schedule_13d.md)**:
 Investors acquiring more than 5% of a company’s [shares](../s/shares.md) must file [Schedule 13D](../s/schedule_13d.md), disclosing the purpose of the purchase and future plans.

3. **SEC Rule 14e-1**:
 Mandates the [offer](../o/offer.md) to remain [open](../o/open.md) for a minimum period, usually 20 [business](../b/business.md) days, providing shareholders ample time for consideration.

4. **Best Price Rule (Rule 14d-10)**:
 Requires that all shareholders receive the identical highest price tendered during the [offer](../o/offer.md) period, preventing preferential treatment of specific shareholders.

## Strategic Motives

### Acquisitions and Mergers

One of the primary motives for a [tender](../t/tender.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) is to acquire a controlling stake in another company. By purchasing [shares](../s/shares.md) directly from the shareholders at a [premium](../p/premium.md), the bidder can bypass company management, making it an efficient method for acquiring control, especially in hostile takeovers.

### Defensive Strategies

Companies may make [tender](../t/tender.md) offers for their own [shares](../s/shares.md) to reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of hostile takeovers. By buying back [shares](../s/shares.md), they increase the ownership percentage of friendly shareholders and insiders, making it harder for an outsider to [gain](../g/gain.md) a controlling [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Financial Restructuring

Through self-[tender](../t/tender.md) offers, companies can [return](../r/return.md) cash to shareholders, often when they believe that their [shares](../s/shares.md) are [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md). This can help in boosting the stock price or adjusting the company's [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md).

## Economic Implications

### Shareholder Wealth

[Tender](../t/tender.md) offers typically come at a [premium](../p/premium.md), benefiting selling shareholders with a price above the current [market value](../m/market_value.md). However, they also introduce risks and uncertainties, particularly in hostile situations where the long-term stability of the company may be threatened.

### Market Perception

[Tender](../t/tender.md) offers, especially those involving significant premiums, signal confidence in the target company's prospects, often leading to a positive short-term response in stock prices. Conversely, failed offers can result in stock price [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and impact [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) negatively.

### Regulatory Impact

Laws and regulations surrounding [tender](../t/tender.md) offers aim to ensure fairness and [transparency](../t/transparency.md), reducing the potential for [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) and protecting the interests of small shareholders. However, these regulations can also complicate and delay transactions, impacting [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

## Case Studies

### Oracle and PeopleSoft

In 2003, Oracle [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) made a hostile [tender](../t/tender.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) to acquire PeopleSoft Inc. The [offer](../o/offer.md) began with a substantial [premium](../p/premium.md) over the [market price](../m/market_price.md), leading to a prolonged legal battle. PeopleSoft initially resisted, but eventually, Oracle succeeded, acquiring PeopleSoft for about $10.3 billion in 2005.

### Carl Icahn and Dell Inc.

[Activist investor](../a/activist_investor.md) Carl Icahn launched a [tender](../t/tender.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) in 2013 for Dell Inc., challenging a management [buyout](../b/buyout.md) led by Michael Dell. Icahn's [tender](../t/tender.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) was part of his broader strategy to block the [buyout](../b/buyout.md), arguing that his proposal provided better [value](../v/value.md) for shareholders. Though Icahn's attempt ultimately failed, it led to a higher [buyout](../b/buyout.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) from Michael Dell and eventually the [privatization](../p/privatization.md) of Dell Inc.

### Unilever and Kraft Heinz

In early 2017, Kraft Heinz made an unexpected $143 billion cash and stock [offer](../o/offer.md) to acquire Unilever. The [offer](../o/offer.md) was rejected swiftly by Unilever, and Kraft Heinz subsequently withdrew its [bid](../b/bid.md). This case illustrates a high-profile, albeit unsuccessful, [tender](../t/tender.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) in the [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md) sector.

## Risks and Challenges

### Regulatory Hurdles

[Tender](../t/tender.md) offers are subject to stringent regulatory scrutiny. Compliance with SEC requirements involves significant legal and [administrative expenses](../a/administrative_expenses.md), and failure to properly disclose can lead to penalties and litigation.

### Hostile Takeover Risks

In hostile [tender](../t/tender.md) offers, resistance from target company management can lead to defensive measures such as poison pills or golden parachutes. These tactics complicate the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), often increasing the cost and time necessary to complete the deal.

### Financial Strain

[Tender](../t/tender.md) offers, especially cash offers, require substantial financial resources. [Financing](../f/financing.md) a large [tender](../t/tender.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) can strain the bidder's finances, affect its stock price, and alter its [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio, impacting future financial flexibility.

### Market Reaction

The [market](../m/market.md)'s reaction to a [tender](../t/tender.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) can be unpredictable. While shareholders may react positively to premiums, [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) about the bidder's intentions and the long-term implications for the target company can lead to [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Conclusion

[Tender](../t/tender.md) offers are a powerful tool in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), providing a direct method for acquiring control or returning [value](../v/value.md) to shareholders. While they present significant opportunities for both bidders and shareholders, they also involve considerable risks and complexities.
