# Termination Of Trade

Termination of trade refers to closing a position and ending the trade lifecycle. It can occur by hitting a target, stop loss, time exit, or discretionary decision.

## Common exit reasons
- Target reached or objective met.
- Stop loss triggered or risk limit hit.
- Time based exit when the setup expires.
- Change in market conditions or new information.

## Example
A trader closes a position at the end of the day due to a rule that avoids overnight risk. The trade is terminated regardless of profit or loss.

## Practical notes
Clear exit rules reduce emotional decisions and help evaluate strategy performance.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Termination Of Trade and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Termination Of Trade as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Termination Of Trade, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Termination Of Trade. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Termination Of Trade alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
