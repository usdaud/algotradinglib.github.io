# Gift Inter Vivos

A "Gift Inter Vivos" (Latin for "gift between the living") refers to a legal term describing a transfer or gift made between living individuals without the expectation or requirement that the recipient provides anything of equal [value](../v/value.md) in [return](../r/return.md). This type of gift is opposite to "gift causa mortis," which is a gift made in anticipation of the giver’s death. For a gift inter vivos to be legally binding, certain conditions must be satisfied, which are generally established by [common law](../c/common_law.md) and statutory law. This document aims to provide a detailed overview of "Gift Inter Vivos," exploring its legal requirements, implications, and related areas of [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Legal Requirements for Gift Inter Vivos

For a gift to be considered a valid Gift Inter Vivos, several key elements must be met:

#### 1. Donative Intent
The donor (the person giving the gift) must have a clear and present intent to make a gift. This means that the donor must intend to transfer the ownership of the gift without expecting anything in [return](../r/return.md).

#### 2. Delivery
The gift must be delivered to the donee (the person receiving the gift). Delivery can be actual (where the item is physically handed over) or constructive (where something symbolizing the item is handed over, such as keys to a car).

#### 3. Acceptance
The donee must accept the gift. Acceptance is generally presumed if the gift is of benefit to the donee and is not burdensome.

#### 4. Competence
Both the donor and donee must have the legal capacity to give and receive the gift. This generally means that they must be of sound mind and of legal age to enter into contracts.

### Types of Property Transferred as Gifts Inter Vivos

#### Tangible Personal Property
This includes physical items such as jewelry, artwork, vehicles, and household goods. For these items, actual delivery is usually required to complete the gift.

#### Intangible Personal Property
This includes items such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts, and intellectual property. These can often be transferred through documentation and registration with appropriate institutions.

#### Real Property
This includes land and buildings. Transfer of [real property](../r/real_property.md) usually requires a [deed](../d/deed.md) and must comply with local property laws, including registration with government authorities.

### Documentation and Formalities

Though verbal gifts can be legally binding if all elements are satisfied, having formal documentation can help prevent disputes and provide clear evidence of the gift.

#### Gift Deed
A gift [deed](../d/deed.md) is a formal legal document that explicitly outlines the transfer of ownership from the donor to the donee. The [deed](../d/deed.md) should include:
- Description of the gift
- Names and addresses of the donor and donee
- Signatures of the donor, donee, and witnesses
- Date of transfer

### Tax Implications

#### Gift Tax
In many jurisdictions, gifts are subject to a [gift tax](../g/gift_tax.md), which is imposed on the donor. The [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) and [exemption](../e/exemption.md) limits can vary, so it is essential to consult [local tax](../l/local_tax.md) laws or a tax professional.

#### Valuation of Gifts
For the purpose of tax calculation, the fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the gift at the time of transfer is considered. This may require an [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md), especially for high-[value](../v/value.md) items like [real estate](../r/real_estate.md).

#### Reporting Requirements
The donor is typically required to file a [gift tax return](../g/gift_tax_return.md), even if no tax is due because the gift falls within allowable exemptions.

### Revocation of Gift Inter Vivos

Once a gift inter vivos is completed, it generally cannot be revoked. Exceptions to this rule include:

#### Fraud or Undue Influence
If the donor was coerced or defrauded into making the gift.

#### Lack of Legal Capacity
If the donor lacked the legal capacity to make the gift at the time of the transfer.

### Case Law and Examples

#### Case Study: Gruen v. Gruen
In this seminal case, a father (donor) gave his son (donee) a valuable painting while reserving a [life estate](../l/life_estate.md) in it for himself. The court upheld the gift despite the father retaining possession of the painting, concluding that all elements of a valid gift inter vivos were met.

#### Corporate Gifting
Companies may also engage in gift inter vivos practices, often for charitable purposes. For instance, large tech firms like Google ( and charities like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ( frequently donate substantial amounts of [money](../m/money.md) or resources as gifts inter vivos.

### Ethical and Practical Considerations

#### Family Dynamics
Gifts inter vivos can sometimes strain family relationships, particularly if perceived as unfair or favoring one member over others.

#### Professional Advice
Engaging legal and financial advisors can aid in ensuring that the gift complies with applicable laws and tax regulations, and objectively evaluating the implications for both the donor and the donee.

### Conclusion

The concept of Gift Inter Vivos is a cornerstone in [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md), [taxation](../t/taxation.md), and family law. By understanding the fundamental requirements and implications of such gifts, individuals can make informed decisions that fulfill their intentions while minimizing legal and tax complications. With proper planning and [execution](../e/execution.md), gifts inter vivos can serve as a powerful tool for transferring [wealth](../w/wealth.md) and providing for loved ones or charitable causes.
