# Gap And Go

Gap and go is an intraday trading pattern where a stock opens with a gap and then continues in the direction of the gap after the market opens. It is often associated with strong catalysts such as earnings or news.

## Setup characteristics
- The stock gaps significantly above or below the prior close.
- Pre market volume and news support the move.
- The opening range shows brief consolidation rather than immediate reversal.

## Entry and management
Traders may enter after the initial opening range breaks in the direction of the gap. Stops are often placed on the opposite side of the opening range. Targets may be based on pre market levels or measured moves.

## Example
A stock gaps up 7 percent after earnings. The first five minute range is tight and breaks higher. A trader buys the break, places a stop below the opening range, and targets a continuation to the next resistance zone.

## Risks
Gap and go can fail when the gap was driven by weak news or when early buyers take profits quickly. Liquidity and spread conditions matter during the open.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Gap And Go and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Gap And Go as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Gap And Go, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Gap And Go. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Gap And Go alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
