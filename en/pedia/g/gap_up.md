# Gap Up

A gap up occurs when a market opens above the prior session close, creating an empty price area on the chart. It reflects new information or order imbalances that emerged outside regular trading hours.

## Common drivers
- Positive earnings surprises.
- Analyst upgrades or corporate actions.
- Strong market wide sentiment.

## Types of gaps
- Common gaps that fill quickly.
- Breakaway gaps that launch a new trend.
- Exhaustion gaps near the end of a trend.

## Trading considerations
A gap up can hold and continue higher or fade back into the prior range. Traders watch the opening range, volume, and follow through to judge the quality of the gap.

## Example
A stock closes at 20 and opens at 22 after upbeat guidance. The opening range holds above 21.50 and price continues higher, suggesting a strong gap.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Gap Up and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Gap Up as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Gap Up, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Gap Up. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Gap Up alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
