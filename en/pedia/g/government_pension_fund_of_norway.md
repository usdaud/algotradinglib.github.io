# Government Pension Fund of Norway

The Government Pension [Fund](../f/fund.md) of Norway, also known as the Norwegian Oil [Fund](../f/fund.md), is a sovereign [wealth](../w/wealth.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) managed by Norges [Bank](../b/bank.md) [Investment Management](../i/investment_management.md) (NBIM) on behalf of the government of Norway. The [fund](../f/fund.md) was established in 1990 to invest the [surplus](../s/surplus.md) revenues of the Norwegian [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) sector. It is one of the largest sovereign [wealth](../w/wealth.md) funds in the world, with assets exceeding $1 trillion. The purpose of the [fund](../f/fund.md) is to ensure a long-term perspective in the management of Norway’s oil [wealth](../w/wealth.md), allowing current and future generations to benefit from the country's [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) [income](../i/income.md).

## History and Purpose

The Government Pension [Fund](../f/fund.md) of Norway consists of two separate entities: the Government Pension [Fund](../f/fund.md) Global (GPFG) and the Government Pension [Fund](../f/fund.md) Norway (GPFN). The GPFG is the largest and is funded by [surplus](../s/surplus.md) [wealth](../w/wealth.md) generated by Norwegian [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) [income](../i/income.md), including [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on oil companies, ownership of [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) fields, and dividends from the partially state-owned oil company, Equinor. The GPFN, on the other hand, is smaller and focuses on domestic investments within Norway.

The [fund](../f/fund.md)'s primary purpose is to provide a financial buffer for the Norwegian [economy](../e/economy.md) in times of economic instability and to ensure that the revenues from oil and gas [will](../w/will.md) benefit both current and future generations. [Investing](../i/investing.md) these revenues in a global diversified portfolio using responsible investment principles allows Norway to decouple its [economy](../e/economy.md) from the volatile oil [market](../m/market.md).

## Governance and Structure

The Norwegian Ministry of [Finance](../f/finance.md) owns the [fund](../f/fund.md), but it delegates the operational management to NBIM, a separate part of Norges [Bank](../b/bank.md), the central [bank](../b/bank.md) of Norway. NBIM is responsible for the day-to-day management, including investment decisions, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and engaging with companies concerning environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.

The [fund](../f/fund.md) is designed to be transparent and accountable. Detailed information about its investments, performance, risks, and management is publicly available. The Ministry of [Finance](../f/finance.md) sets forth guidelines and regulations that the NBIM must follow, including ethical and sustainability standards. These frameworks are reviewed and updated regularly to reflect global [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) and the evolving landscape of responsible investment.

## Investment Strategy

The Government Pension [Fund](../f/fund.md) Global invests in international [equity](../e/equity.md), [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) markets, adhering to a strict set of guidelines set by the Norwegian Ministry of [Finance](../f/finance.md). The allocation is designed to balance [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) carefully. The [fund](../f/fund.md)'s portfolio typically consists of:

- **Equities:** Approximately 70% of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets are invested in [stocks](../s/stock.md) globally, including developed and emerging markets.
- **[Fixed Income](../f/fixed_income.md):** Around 25-30% of the investments are in bonds, including government and corporate bonds.
- **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md):** Up to 5% of the [fund](../f/fund.md) is allocated to [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), focusing on prime properties in major cities around the world.

The [fund](../f/fund.md) employs a long-term [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md), and its strategy is predicated on systematic [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), [diversification](../d/diversification.md), and a focus on sustainable investments. This approach aims to maximize returns while minimizing risks associated with [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and economic downturns.

## Ethical Guidelines and Responsible Investment

One of the key features of the Government Pension [Fund](../f/fund.md) of Norway is its commitment to [ethical investing](../e/ethical_investing.md). The [fund](../f/fund.md) has a set of ethical guidelines that govern its investment decisions, formulated by the Norwegian Parliament. These guidelines include:

- **Exclusion Criteria:** The [fund](../f/fund.md) excludes companies involved in serious human rights violations, severe environmental damage, unacceptable greenhouse gas emissions, and those producing certain types of weapons, like nuclear arms. Tobacco companies and firms heavily reliant on coal are also excluded.
- **Active Ownership:** NBIM practices active ownership by using its influence as a major [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) to promote sustainable [business](../b/business.md) practices. This includes voting at [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meetings, engaging in dialogues with company management, and working with other investors to push for positive changes.
- **Sustainability Initiatives:** The [fund](../f/fund.md) actively looks for investment opportunities that contribute to positive environmental and social outcomes, such as renewable energy projects and companies with strong ESG practices.
