# Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (GAPP)

## Introduction
The Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (GAPP), also known as the Santiago Principles, are a set of guidelines and principles geared towards fostering [transparency](../t/transparency.md), good governance, accountability, and prudent investment practices within Sovereign [Wealth](../w/wealth.md) Funds (SWFs). The GAPP was initially developed by the International Working Group of Sovereign [Wealth](../w/wealth.md) Funds (IWG-SWF) and later endorsed by the International Monetary [Fund](../f/fund.md) (IMF) in 2008.

SWFs are state-owned investment funds that manage a vast array of assets and investments. These funds are usually derived from the country’s reserves, which accumulate from sources such as revenues from natural resources, [trade](../t/trade.md) surpluses, fiscal surpluses, or foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) operations. The GAPP aims to ensure these funds operate in a manner that promotes global financial stability while serving the economic needs of their respective nations.

## Objectives of the Santiago Principles

1. **Promote [Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: The principles aim to enhance the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) of SWFs by encouraging [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of investment objectives, strategies, governance frameworks, and [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md).

2. **Foster Accountability**: GAPP encourages SWFs to account for their activities and performance to the governments and the public of their respective countries to maintain legitimacy.

3. **Ensure Sound Governance Structures**: Implementing [robust](../r/robust.md) governance structures with clearly defined roles and responsibilities is an essential objective of the principles.

4. **Encourage Prudent Investment Practices**: The guidelines advocate for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and strategic [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) to ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the funds.

5. **Facilitate Global Financial Stability**: By promoting [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) among SWFs, the GAPP contributes to the stability of the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

## Key Elements of GAPP

### Principle 1: Clear Objectives
SWFs should have well-defined investment objectives disclosed to the public, ensuring clarity in their operations and purposes.

### Principle 2: Transparent Legal Framework
Funds should operate within a transparent legal framework that establishes clear guidelines and boundaries for their operations.

### Principle 3: Public Disclosure
SWFs should be responsible for regular public disclosures of their activities, governance structures, investment strategies, and [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).

### Principle 4: Sound Governance
Instituting a governance framework that includes a clear separation of roles and responsibilities among the funds' management, the government, and other stakeholders is paramount.

### Principle 5: Investment and Risk Management
SWFs should adopt solid investment policies and [risk management frameworks](../r/risk_management_frameworks.md) to safeguard and grow the assets while minimizing risks.

### Principle 6: Ethical Conduct
Funds are encouraged to observe the highest [ethical standards](../e/ethical_standards_in_trading.md) in conducting their operations, often including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in their investment strategies.

## Historical Context

### Origin of SWFs
The first SWFs were established in the mid-20th century, with countries like Kuwait and Norway creating funds to manage revenues from oil exports. Over time, especially in the 2000s, the number of SWFs grew significantly as more countries, particularly those with [surplus](../s/surplus.md) reserves, sought to manage and invest their [wealth](../w/wealth.md) prudently.

### Genesis of GAPP
The need for a coherent set of principles for SWFs gained [momentum](../m/momentum.md) following concerns about the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and objectives of these funds. The [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2008 further highlighted the importance of having a standardized framework. Consequently, the IWG-SWF was formed in 2008, comprising representatives from 23 countries, to develop [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) for managing SWFs. The resulting Santiago Principles, or GAPP, were formally introduced in October 2008.

## Implementation and Impact

### Adoption by SWFs
Most major SWFs have adopted the Santiago Principles, demonstrating their commitment to [transparency](../t/transparency.md), accountability, and good governance. For instance, Norway's Government Pension [Fund](../f/fund.md) Global (GPFG) link and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) link are two examples of funds that adhere to GAPP.

### Enhancing Credibility
By committing to GAPP, SWFs enhance their credibility and legitimacy globally. This adherence helps in mitigating fears that SWFs might make investments based on political motives rather than economic and financial principles.

### Integration into National Policies
Countries often integrate GAPP into their national policies, thereby ensuring that their SWFs align with international [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) and contribute positively to their national economies.

## Challenges and Criticisms

### Implementation Variability
While many SWFs commit to GAPP, the extent of implementation can vary. Some funds may have differing levels of [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) and governance standards, which could affect the overall effectiveness of the principles.

### Geo-Political Concerns
Despite adherence to GAPP, concerns about geopolitical motives behind certain investments by SWFs persist. Countries receiving investments may question the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) intentions, especially if the investments align with strategic national interests of the [investing](../i/investing.md) country.

### Dynamic Financial Environment
The financial environment is constantly evolving, and SWFs must continually adapt to new challenges and risks. This dynamic nature requires the Santiago Principles to be regularly reviewed and updated to remain relevant and effective.

## Future Prospects

### Increased Adoption and Refinement
Going forward, there is an anticipated increase in the adoption of GAPP by emerging SWFs. Alongside this, regular refinements and updates to the principles [will](../w/will.md) be necessary to accommodate new financial challenges and innovations, such as technological advancements and shifts in global economic power.

### Integration with ESG Standards
As environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations [gain](../g/gain.md) importance, SWFs are likely to integrate these aspects more comprehensively into their investment strategies. GAPP can be expanded to include explicit guidelines on ESG, which [will](../w/will.md) further encourage responsible and sustainable investment practices.

### Enhanced Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing
The future also holds potential for enhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing among SWFs. Establishing platforms for regular dialogue, best practice sharing, and [joint](../j/joint.md) initiatives can strengthen the implementation of GAPP globally.

## Conclusion
The Generally Accepted Principles and Practices, or Santiago Principles, serve as a foundational framework for the sound and transparent management of Sovereign [Wealth](../w/wealth.md) Funds. They play a vital role in promoting good governance, accountability, and prudent investment practices, contributing to both national and global financial stability. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, the principles [will](../w/will.md) need to adapt to remain effective and relevant, ensuring that SWFs can meet the challenges and opportunities of the future.
