# Gamma scalping

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) [scalping](../s/scalping.md) is a sophisticated [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) primarily used by [options](../o/options.md) traders to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the dynamic price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This strategy is tightly linked with other key Greek metrics in [options](../o/options.md) trading, specifically [delta](../d/delta.md) and [gamma](../g/gamma.md), and requires comprehensive knowledge of how these [Greeks](../g/greeks.md) interact over time and with changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Below is an in-depth exploration of [gamma](../g/gamma.md) [scalping](../s/scalping.md), its principles, methods, and applications.

## Understanding Key Concepts

### Delta (Δ)

[Delta](../d/delta.md) represents the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). For instance, a [delta](../d/delta.md) of 0.5 implies that if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price increases by $1, the option's price is expected to increase by $0.50. [Delta](../d/delta.md) can [range](../r/range.md) from -1 to 1. For call [options](../o/options.md), [delta](../d/delta.md) ranges from 0 to 1, while for [put options](../p/put_options.md), it ranges from -1 to 0.

### Gamma (Γ)

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) represents the rate of change of [delta](../d/delta.md) with respect to changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). In other words, [gamma](../g/gamma.md) measures the curvature in the price of the option relative to the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price change. High [gamma](../g/gamma.md) values indicate that [delta](../d/delta.md) could change significantly with small moves in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), making the option more sensitive to these moves.

### Theta (Θ)

[Theta](../t/theta.md), also known as [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), measures the rate at which the option's [value](../v/value.md) decreases over time, holding all other factors constant. It represents the negative impact of the passage of time on the option's price.

## The Principle of Gamma Scalping

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) [scalping](../s/scalping.md) involves [delta](../d/delta.md)-hedging an [options](../o/options.md) position while taking into account the [gamma exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md). The primary objective is to [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md) from directional moves in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) by continually adjusting the [hedge](../h/hedge.md).

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Establishing the [Options](../o/options.md) Position:** Traders start by taking a long [gamma](../g/gamma.md) position, typically through long straddles, strangles, or buying calls and puts. A long [gamma](../g/gamma.md) position means that the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s portfolio [will](../w/will.md) [gain](../g/gain.md) positive [delta](../d/delta.md) as the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price rises and negative [delta](../d/delta.md) as it falls.

2. **[Delta](../d/delta.md)-Hedging:** To remain [neutral](../n/neutral.md) from a [delta](../d/delta.md) perspective, traders need to sell [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) when it rises, and buy [shares](../s/shares.md) when it falls. This process is known as [delta](../d/delta.md)-hedging.

3. **Gradual Accumulation of [Profit](../p/profit.md):** As the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price fluctuates, these [delta](../d/delta.md)-hedging adjustments allow traders to accumulate profits over time, effectively "[scalping](../s/scalping.md)" small gains from each price move.

4. **[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) and P&L Relationship:** Every time a [delta](../d/delta.md)-[hedge](../h/hedge.md) adjustment is made, it locks in [profit](../p/profit.md) due to the [gamma](../g/gamma.md) of the position. More significant price movements result in higher profits due to the [convexity](../c/convexity.md) introduced by [gamma](../g/gamma.md).

## Practical Considerations

### Market Conditions

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) [scalping](../s/scalping.md) is highly dependent on the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and price movement of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). High [volatility](../v/volatility.md) environments increase the number of adjustments and potential profitability. Conversely, low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) conditions might not provide sufficient price movements to cover [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

### Transaction Costs

Frequent buying and selling of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) can incur substantial [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md). Traders must consider these costs when implementing a [gamma](../g/gamma.md) [scalping](../s/scalping.md) strategy, as they can erode the profitability.

### Risk Management

Maintaining a [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) position can sometimes lead to significant losses if the [market](../m/market.md) behaves unexpectedly. Continuous monitoring and adjusting of positions are crucial to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.

### Time Decay (Theta)

While [gamma](../g/gamma.md) [scalping](../s/scalping.md) aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price movements, it must also contend with the erosive effects of [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) on the [options](../o/options.md) premiums. If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) does not move enough, the [trader](../t/trader.md) may suffer losses due to [theta](../t/theta.md) decay.

### Volatility Changes

Changes in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can also affect the profitability of [gamma](../g/gamma.md) [scalping](../s/scalping.md). An increase in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) generally benefits the strategy, while a decrease can reduce the effectiveness of hedging actions.

## Example Scenario

### Initial Setup

Consider a [trader](../t/trader.md) who buys a [straddle](../s/straddle.md) at-the-[money](../m/money.md). The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock is trading at $100, and the [trader](../t/trader.md) purchases one [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [delta](../d/delta.md) of 0.5 and one [put option](../p/put.md) with a [delta](../d/delta.md) of -0.5. The total [delta](../d/delta.md) of the position is 0 ([neutral](../n/neutral.md)).

### Market Movement

1. **Stock Price Increases to $105:**
 - The long [call option](../c/call_option.md)'s [delta](../d/delta.md) increases to 0.6.
 - The long [put option](../p/put.md)'s [delta](../d/delta.md) decreases to -0.4.
 - Combined [delta](../d/delta.md) = 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2 (long [delta](../d/delta.md) position)

 To [delta](../d/delta.md)-[hedge](../h/hedge.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) sells 20 [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock to bring the position back to [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md).

2. **Stock Price Decreases to $95:**
 - The long [call option](../c/call_option.md)'s [delta](../d/delta.md) decreases to 0.4.
 - The long [put option](../p/put.md)'s [delta](../d/delta.md) increases to -0.6.
 - Combined [delta](../d/delta.md) = 0.4 - 0.6 = -0.2 (short [delta](../d/delta.md) position)

 To [delta](../d/delta.md)-[hedge](../h/hedge.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) buys 20 [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock to bring the position back to [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md).

### Profit Realization

The profits from these adjustments come from selling high and buying low, effectively capturing the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) moves in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Each price movement leads to [delta](../d/delta.md) adjustments that contribute to overall profits.
