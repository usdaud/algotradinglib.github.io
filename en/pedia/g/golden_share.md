# Golden Share

A "golden share" is a type of share that gives its holder special voting rights, enabling them to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) a significant degree of control over the company, beyond what is typically proportionate to their level of [equity](../e/equity.md) ownership. This special power is typically used by governments to retain control over privatized companies or in strategic industries where national [interest](../i/interest.md) is a consideration.

## Definition and Features

Golden [shares](../s/shares.md) are unique financial instruments that typically possess some of the following features:

1. **Voting Rights:** The golden share often comes with veto power on critical company decisions, such as mergers, acquisitions, and changes in [business](../b/business.md) structure.
2. **Ownership Retention:** Governments or state entities often [hold](../h/hold.md) golden [shares](../s/shares.md) to retain a foot in privatized companies.
3. **Specific to National Interests:** These [shares](../s/shares.md) are commonly used in industries considered strategically important, such as defense, energy, and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).
4. **Non-transferable:** Golden [shares](../s/shares.md) are usually non-transferable, meaning the special rights cannot be sold or traded to another entity.

## Historical Context

The concept of the golden share emerged prominently in the 1980s when various nation-states began to privatize state-owned enterprises. Governments utilized golden [shares](../s/shares.md) as a mechanism to retain control over critical industries while allowing private investment and [market](../m/market.md) efficiencies to take root.

### Case Study: The United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, during Margaret Thatcher's government, golden [shares](../s/shares.md) were often issued in privatized utilities like British Gas and British Telecom. These [shares](../s/shares.md) allowed the UK government to maintain veto power over any changes that could affect national [security](../s/security.md) or public service [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Case Study: Portugal

The Portuguese government retained golden [shares](../s/shares.md) in several companies during the wave of [privatization](../p/privatization.md) in the 1990s. For instance, in the energy company EDP (Energias de Portugal), the state kept a golden share to ensure control over significant decisions affecting the nation's energy [security](../s/security.md).

## Legal and Regulatory Landscape

The legal framework governing golden [shares](../s/shares.md) can be complex and varies by jurisdiction. However, golden [shares](../s/shares.md) have often been the subject of legal disputes, particularly within the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) (EU). The EU has stringent rules on [market](../m/market.md) competition and state aid, leading to several high-profile cases where member states' golden [shares](../s/shares.md) were challenged.

### European Court of Justice (ECJ) Rulings

The ECJ has ruled in various instances that golden [shares](../s/shares.md) constitute a barrier to the free movement of [capital](../c/capital.md) and have demanded the removal of such share structures unless they can be justified by overriding reasons of public [interest](../i/interest.md). Examples of such rulings include:

- The 2002 ruling against the Portuguese and Belgian governments in the cases of Companhia de Portugal and Société Nationale de Chemins de Fer.
- The 2003 ruling against France concerning its golden share in the oil company Elf Aquitaine.

## Modern Examples

### France: Renault

The French government retains a golden share in Renault, allowing it to influence decisions that could impact the national [economy](../e/economy.md) or workforce significantly.

### Italy: ENI

Italy has maintained a golden share in ENI, a major player in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md). This ensures that critical decisions align with the nation's energy policy and [security](../s/security.md) needs.

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages

1. **National [Security](../s/security.md):** Ensures control over strategic sectors and protects against hostile takeovers.
2. **Public [Interest](../i/interest.md):** Secures societal and economic interests, particularly in utilities and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).
3. **Continuity:** Maintains consistency in policy and management of essential services.

### Disadvantages

1. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Deterrence:** May deter [foreign investment](../f/foreign_investment.md) due to perceived governmental interference.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Distortion:** Can lead to inefficiencies and [market](../m/market.md) distortions.
3. **Legal Challenges:** Subject to regulatory scrutiny and potential legal conflicts, particularly within the EU.

## Future Considerations

As [market](../m/market.md) liberalization continues globally, the use of golden [shares](../s/shares.md) could either diminish due to increased regulatory scrutiny or evolve into new forms that align with contemporary economic and geopolitical realities.

### Technological Innovation

The rise of digital and technological industries, which also bear strategic importance, might see new iterations of golden share-like mechanisms to balance innovation, investment, and national [security](../s/security.md).

## Conclusion

Golden [shares](../s/shares.md) represent a fascinating intersection of [equity](../e/equity.md) control, public policy, and [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). Their continued relevance [will](../w/will.md) likely depend on a nation's economic structure, strategic sectors, and evolving regulatory landscapes. Whether they remain a staple in governance or phase out under [market](../m/market.md) pressures and legal scrutiny is a subject of ongoing debate.
