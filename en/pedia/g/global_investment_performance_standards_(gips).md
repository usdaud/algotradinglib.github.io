# Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)

## Introduction
Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) is a set of standardized, [industry](../i/industry.md)-wide ethical principles that guide the calculation and presentation of investment performance. Developed by the CFA Institute, GIPS aims to ensure consistency, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and comparability among the investment performance reports of different firms on a global scale. This helps to facilitate fair competition among [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) firms and increases consumer confidence.

Developed initially in 1999 and continuously revised, GIPS has become a globally accepted standard. Compliance with GIPS enhances the credibility of a [firm](../f/firm.md)’s performance presentations and promotes [industry](../i/industry.md) [best practices](../b/best_practices.md).

## Key Principles
The GIPS standards are built around several key principles:

### 1. Completeness and Accuracy
Performance figures must be complete and accurate, representing all the actual returns realized by an investment portfolio.

### 2. Consistency
Consistent methodologies should be adopted for calculation and presentation of returns, ensuring comparability between periods and across firms.

### 3. Transparency
Clear [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of all relevant details related to the performance, such as fees and expenses, must be provided to avoid misleading information.

### 4. Fair Representation
Performance results must fairly represent the entire [firm](../f/firm.md)'s investment strategies and not be cherry-picked to showcase only the best outcomes.

## Components of GIPS
GIPS encompasses several key components that [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) firms need to adhere to in [order](../o/order.md) to claim compliance:

### 1. Input Data
Accurate and complete data inputs are essential. Firms must gather and maintain all necessary data from the inception of the [firm](../f/firm.md) or the portfolio.

### 2. Calculation Methodology
Standard methodologies for calculating returns are specified. This includes the use of time-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) rates of [return](../r/return.md), appropriate [fee](../f/fee.md) calculations, and proper handling of cash flows.

### 3. Composite Construction
Portfolios with similar investment strategies are grouped into composites. This ensures a more accurate representation of the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s performance in specific strategies.

### 4. Disclosures
Mandatory disclosures include methodologies used, fees charged, and important assumptions. These disclosures help clients understand the context behind the presented performance.

### 5. Presentation and Reporting
Presenting performance results must follow strict guidelines and formats. For example, firms must present a minimum of five years of historical performance or since inception if the [firm](../f/firm.md) is younger than five years.

### 6. Real Estate and Private Equity
Specific rules apply to [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) investments due to their unique characteristics.

## Uses of GIPS
### Investor Confidence
Compliance with GIPS provides investors with confidence that the [firm](../f/firm.md) has adhered to rigorous standards, enhancing the credibility of the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s performance claims.

### Competitive Advantage
Adherence to GIPS can be a competitive differentiator, showing potential clients that the [firm](../f/firm.md) follows global [industry](../i/industry.md) [best practices](../b/best_practices.md).

### Consistency and Comparability
By standardizing performance calculations and presentation, GIPS allows for the comparison of returns across different firms and geographical locations.

### Regulatory Alignment
In some regions, aligning with GIPS may also ensure compliance with local or regional laws and regulations regarding investment performance reporting.

### Ethical Practices
GIPS promotes ethical practices in reporting performance, which aligns with broader [ethical standards](../e/ethical_standards_in_trading.md) and reputation management for investment firms.

## Adoption and Updates
GIPS standards are continually updated to reflect changes in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), investment products, and client needs. The CFA Institute gathers feedback from [industry](../i/industry.md) professionals and stakeholders to make necessary updates.

### Firm-Wide Adoption
For a [firm](../f/firm.md) to claim compliance, GIPS must be applied [firm](../f/firm.md)-wide, covering all the portfolios managed by the [firm](../f/firm.md). Partial compliance is not allowed.

### Verification
Though not mandatory, it is encouraged that firms undergo third-party verification. This independent assessment can attest to the [firm](../f/firm.md)’s adherence to GIPS standards.

## GIPS 2020
The most recent version, GIPS 2020, introduced significant changes to improve clarity and usability:

### Simplifications
GIPS 2020 simplified the standards to improve understanding and adoption rates among smaller firms.

### Flexibility
More [options](../o/options.md) were provided for reporting with greater flexibility to accommodate different types of investments and [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

### Enhanced Disclosures
Greater emphasis on [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements to ensure that investors receive all necessary information to make informed decisions.

## Real-World Implementations
### Large Asset Managers
Many large [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) firms such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity adhere to GIPS standards. Compliance signals their commitment to [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) and enhances their reputation.

### Boutique Firms
Smaller, boutique [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) companies also adopt GIPS to showcase their commitment to [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and to level the playing field with larger competitors.

## Conclusion
GIPS has become a cornerstone in the [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) [industry](../i/industry.md), promoting [transparency](../t/transparency.md), consistency, and fair representation of performance. Compliance with GIPS standards can significantly enhance the credibility and competitiveness of [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) firms, helping them to [gain](../g/gain.md) and maintain client [trust](../t/trust.md). As the financial landscape continues to evolve, GIPS standards [will](../w/will.md) likely continue to adapt, further cementing their role in shaping ethical and transparent performance reporting practices in the global investment [industry](../i/industry.md).
