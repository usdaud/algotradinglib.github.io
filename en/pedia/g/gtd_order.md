# GTD Order

A GTD order is a good till date order that stays active until a specified expiration date. If it is not filled by that date, it is canceled automatically.

## Key characteristics
- Active across multiple sessions until the chosen date.
- Useful for planned entries or exits within a defined window.
- Broker specific rules may limit the maximum duration.

## Example
A trader places a limit buy at 95 with a GTD date of two weeks. If the stock does not reach 95 by the expiration date, the order is canceled.

## Practical notes
GTD orders should be reviewed when market conditions change. A planned level can become invalid due to new information.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for GTD Order and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating GTD Order as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For GTD Order, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying GTD Order. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use GTD Order alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
