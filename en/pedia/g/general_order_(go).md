# General Order (GO)

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), a General [Order](../o/order.md) (GO) represents a fundamental concept integral to the functionality and [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades. General Orders encapsulate the instructions and directives issued by traders or [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) to manage the buying and selling of securities. This detailed exploration aims to break down the various facets of General Orders, including their types, [execution](../e/execution.md) methods, pivotal role in the trading ecosystem, key advantages, associated risks, and evolving trends within [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).

## Types of General Orders

### 1. Market Orders
A [Market Order](../m/market_order.md) is the most straightforward type of General [Order](../o/order.md). It instructs the trading system to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) immediately at the best available current price. [Market](../m/market.md) Orders are executed almost instantaneously, guaranteeing the [trade](../t/trade.md)'s completion but not the [execution](../e/execution.md) price.

#### Characteristics:
- **Immediate [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Ensures that the [order](../o/order.md) is executed as soon as it reaches the [market](../m/market.md).
- **Price [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: The final [execution](../e/execution.md) price may vary, especially in volatile markets.

### 2. Limit Orders
A [Limit Order](../l/limit_order.md) sets a maximum or minimum price at which one is willing to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md). Unlike [Market](../m/market.md) Orders, Limit Orders are not guaranteed to be executed if the [market price](../m/market_price.md) does not reach the specified limit.

#### Characteristics:
- **Price Control**: Ensures that the [order](../o/order.md) is executed at or better than the specified price.
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md) [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: The [order](../o/order.md) may not be filled if the [market](../m/market.md) does not reach the limit price.

### 3. Stop Orders
Stop Orders (or [Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)) are used to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) once the price reaches a specified level, known as the stop price. When the stop price is reached, the [Stop Order](../s/stop_order.md) becomes a [Market Order](../m/market_order.md) and is executed at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md).

#### Characteristics:
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Helps in limiting losses or protecting profits by triggering the [order](../o/order.md) at a predefined price.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Impact**: Converts to a [Market Order](../m/market_order.md) upon reaching the stop price, which may lead to a significant price impact in volatile markets.

### 4. Stop-Limit Orders
A [Stop-Limit Order](../s/stop-limit_order.md) combines the features of Stop Orders and Limit Orders. It becomes a [Limit Order](../l/limit_order.md) once the stop price is reached, specifying the maximum price to buy (or minimum price to sell).

#### Characteristics:
- **Precision**: Provides control over the [execution](../e/execution.md) price after the stop price is triggered.
- **Complexity**: May result in no [execution](../e/execution.md) if the limit price is not met after the stop price is triggered.

### 5. Trailing Stop Orders
[Trailing Stop](../t/trailing_stop.md) Orders are dynamic Stop Orders in which the stop price moves according to [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations, allowing profits to run while locking in a portion of [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md).

#### Characteristics:
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts the stop price based on a fixed amount or percentage below the [market price](../m/market_price.md).
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Protection**: Enables capturing upward trends while [offering](../o/offering.md) downside protection.

### 6. Fill or Kill (FOK) Orders
FOK Orders are immediate-or-cancel orders that must be filled in their entirety at the stated price or not at all.

#### Characteristics:
- **All or Nothing**: Ensures that the whole [order](../o/order.md) is executed immediately; otherwise, it is cancelled.
- **High Urgency**: Typically used in fast-moving markets where swift [execution](../e/execution.md) is necessary.

### 7. Immediate or Cancel (IOC) Orders
IOC Orders require that any portion of the [order](../o/order.md) that can be filled immediately is executed, and the remaining part is cancelled.

#### Characteristics:
- **Partial [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Allows for immediate [execution](../e/execution.md) of available parts of the [order](../o/order.md).
- **Residual Cancellation**: Any unfilled quantity is automatically cancelled.

## Execution Methods

### 1. Direct Market Access (DMA)
DMA allows traders to place orders directly on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [order book](../o/order_book.md) using their own [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), bypassing traditional [broker](../b/broker.md) intermediaries.

#### Advantages:
- **Speed**: Faster [execution](../e/execution.md) times as orders are routed directly.
- **Control**: Greater control over [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), including the timing and price.

### 2. Smart Order Routing (SOR)
SOR involves using algorithms to route orders to various trading venues to achieve the best possible [execution](../e/execution.md) in terms of price and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

#### Advantages:
- **Best [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Optimizes the [order routing](../o/order_routing.md) process to achieve the best possible [execution](../e/execution.md) terms.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Finding**: Increases chances of finding [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets.

### 3. Algorithmic Execution Strategies
[Algorithmic Execution](../a/algorithmic_execution.md) Strategies [leverage](../l/leverage.md) predefined algorithms to automate the [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades based on specified criteria such as [volume](../v/volume.md), price, and time.

#### Examples:
- **[Volume](../v/volume.md)-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price (VWAP)**: Breaks the [order](../o/order.md) into smaller parts to fulfill the [trade](../t/trade.md) close to the average price over a specified time period.
- **Time-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price (TWAP)**: [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) the [trade](../t/trade.md) evenly over a specified timeframe.

## Role in Algorithmic Trading

### 1. Order Management
General Orders form the backbone of [Order Management Systems](../o/order_management_systems.md) (OMS), allowing traders to create, monitor, modify, and cancel orders effectively.

### 2. Market Making
[Market](../m/market.md) makers utilize General Orders to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by continuously buying and selling securities to maintain a [market](../m/market.md).

### 3. Risk Management
