# Global Risk Management

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), commonly referred to as algo trading, is the process of executing trades in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) using automated, predefined criteria based on [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and algorithms. While this trading method has numerous advantages, including speed, reduced human error, and the ability to [handle](../h/handle.md) large volumes of transactions, it also comes with its unique set of risks. Global [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is a crucial aspect of algo trading, as it encompasses identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential risks that can have adverse effects on the performance of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). This document explores the key components of global [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), focusing on [risk](../r/risk.md) types, strategies for managing those risks, technological [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), regulatory compliance, and case studies from prominent financial institutions.

### Types of Risks in Algorithmic Trading

1. **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**:
   - **Definition**: The potential for losses due to changes in [market](../m/market.md) prices, e.g., stock prices, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, or [currency exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md) rates.
   - **Impacts**: [Market risk](../m/market_risk.md) can significantly affect the profitability of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), particularly those that do not account for sudden [market](../m/market.md) movements.

2. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**:
   - **Definition**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) that an [asset](../a/asset.md) cannot be traded quickly enough in the [market](../m/market.md) to prevent a loss or make the desired [profit](../p/profit.md).
   - **Impacts**: High-frequency [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) can suffer losses if there's insufficient [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to support their rapid buy and sell actions.

3. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**:
   - **Definition**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) that a [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) [will](../w/will.md) [fail](../f/fail.md) to fulfill its financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
   - **Impacts**: This is especially relevant in [over-the-counter (OTC) markets](../o/over-the-counter_markets.md) where the failure of a [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) can lead to significant financial losses.

   - **Impacts**: Includes risks from software bugs, hardware failures, and human errors in code implementation or [execution](../e/execution.md).

5. **[Regulatory Risk](../r/regulatory_risk.md)**:
   - **Definition**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) of losses due to non-compliance with laws, regulations, and guidelines governing [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
   - **Impacts**: Non-compliance can lead to fines, legal penalties, and reputational damage.

6. **[Model Risk](../m/model_risk.md)**:
   - **Definition**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) used in [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) may be incorrect or misapplied.
   - **Impacts**: Can lead to incorrect [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md) and significant financial losses.
