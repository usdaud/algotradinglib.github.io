# Gann Grid

A Gann grid is a charting overlay inspired by W.D. Gann that places a square or rectangular grid on price and time. The grid is meant to highlight geometric relationships between price and time, with angles such as the 1x1 line representing a balanced rate of change.

## Core idea
Gann analysis assumes that markets often move in structured swings and that certain angles and divisions can act as support or resistance. The grid provides a visual framework for those angles and divisions.

## How it is built
- Choose a significant low or high as the anchor.
- Set the scale so that one unit of time equals one unit of price for the 1x1 angle.
- Draw additional angles, such as 2x1, 1x2, and other fractional angles.
- Add horizontal and vertical grid lines to mark subdivisions.

## Interpretation
Price moving above a key angle is interpreted as strength, while falling below can signal weakness. Intersections of angles and grid lines are treated as potential decision points.

## Example
A trader anchors a Gann grid at a major low and observes price following the 1x1 angle. When price breaks below the 2x1 angle, the trader views it as a possible trend shift and tightens risk.

## Limitations
The tool is sensitive to scaling and the chosen anchor point. Different chart scales can produce different signals, so consistent settings are important.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Gann Grid and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Gann Grid as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Gann Grid, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Gann Grid. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Gann Grid alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
