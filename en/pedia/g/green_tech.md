# Green Tech

Green technology, often abbreviated as green tech, encompasses the application of technology and science to environmentally sustainable practices. It aims to mitigate or reverse the effects of human activity on the environment through innovative solutions. The field includes a wide array of methodologies, products, and technologies designed to conserve resources, reduce emissions, and limit the negative impact on the planet. This burgeoning sector is dynamic and broad, encompassing diverse areas such as energy production, waste management, transportation, and more.

## Renewable Energy Technologies

### Solar Power
Solar power is harvested by converting sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells or concentrated solar power systems. Photovoltaics (PV) use semiconductor materials, such as silicon, to directly convert sunlight into electricity. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems utilize mirrors or lenses to focus a large area of sunlight onto a small area, generating heat that can produce electricity through a steam turbine.
