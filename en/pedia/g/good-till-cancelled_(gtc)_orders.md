# Good-Till-Cancelled (GTC) Orders

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), "Good-Till-Cancelled" (GTC) orders represent a type of [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) that remains active until it is either executed or explicitly canceled by the [trader](../t/trader.md). Unlike day orders that expire if not filled by the end of the trading day, GTC orders provide traders with the flexibility to set their trades and not worry about them expiring if the [price target](../p/price_target.md) isn’t met within that same day.

### Key Features of GTC Orders

1. **[Duration](../d/duration.md)**: GTC orders remain in effect until the [order](../o/order.md) is completed or manually canceled. This can be particularly advantageous for long-term investors or traders who have a specific [price target](../p/price_target.md) in mind and are not concerned with the timing of the [trade](../t/trade.md).

2. **Flexibility**: By using GTC orders, traders do not need to constantly monitor their positions or re-enter orders each day. This can help in reducing the hassle and administrative burden.

3. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: GTC orders [will](../w/will.md) be executed at the provided limit price or better. This ensures that traders are not forced to accept less favorable prices.

### Practical Application

#### Example Scenario

Imagine an [investor](../i/investor.md) who believes that a particular stock, say XYZ Corp, is worth buying if it drops to $50 per share. However, the current trading price is $55. The [investor](../i/investor.md) can place a GTC [order](../o/order.md) to buy [shares](../s/shares.md) at $50. If the stock price falls to $50 at any point in the future, the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) automatically be executed. Conversely, if the price never drops to this level, the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) merely remain [open](../o/open.md) until it is canceled.

### Advantages of GTC Orders

1. **Reduced Oversight Requirement**: Traders do not need to daily watch their orders or continually re-enter them.

2. **Strategic Planning**: Investors can set long-term strategy with GTC orders, targeting specific price levels based on analysis without worrying about short-term fluctuations.

3. **Easier Long-Term Investment**: For long term investors who are focused on purchasing securities at particular price points, this provides an efficient mechanism to achieve their goals without daily intervention.

### Disadvantages of GTC Orders

1. **Potential for being Overlooked**: As the [order](../o/order.md) remains active indefinitely, it could be forgotten, leading to unexpected trades days, months, or even years after being placed.

2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Changes**: Over time, [market](../m/market.md) conditions can change, and the price point deemed favorable at the time of placing the GTC [order](../o/order.md) may no longer be relevant.

### Comparing with Other Order Types

1. **Day Orders**: These orders expire at the end of the trading day if not filled. They need frequent reassessment and [order](../o/order.md) placement but are more suitable for daily trading tactics.

2. **Fill or [Kill](../k/kill.md) (FOK)**: These orders must be executed immediately in their entirety or canceled. They are suited for traders needing instant [execution](../e/execution.md) without compromise.

3. **Immediate or Cancel (IOC)**: These orders are similar to FOK but allow partial fills with the remainder being canceled.

### Broker and Exchange Regulations

Different brokers and exchanges may have varied rules regarding GTC orders, including maximum durations. Some institutions may limit a GTC [order](../o/order.md) to 30 to 90 days due to regulatory considerations or internal policies.

#### Notable Brokers Offering GTC Orders

1. **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md)**: A leading brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) that supports a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md), including GTC orders with detailed setups.

2. **TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md)**: This brokerage provides GTC orders, allowing investors the flexibility to maintain [open](../o/open.md) orders over significant periods. Detailed information can be found on their public materials.

3. **[E*TRADE](../e/e_trade.md)**: Known for a user-friendly platform, [E*TRADE](../e/e_trade.md) offers GTC [order](../o/order.md) [options](../o/options.md) catering to both novice and experienced investors. Further

### Algorithmic Trading and GTC Orders

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), GTC orders might be used to maintain certain positions without the need of day-to-day intervention. Bots or algorithms can identify target prices and set GTC orders ensuring that the [execution](../e/execution.md) happens even during off-peak hours or period of lower human vigilance.

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems can be designed so that GTC orders act as a [fail](../f/fail.md)-safe mechanism, thereby ensuring that exceptionally prolonged [market](../m/market.md) strategies are adhered to without the [risk](../r/risk.md) of expiring orders. Integrating GTC orders within an algorithm allows for long-term planning and strategy [execution](../e/execution.md) seamlessly aligning with the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s broader objectives.

### Custom Alerts and Management Tools

Many modern [broker](../b/broker.md) platforms provide supplementary tools for managing GTC orders effectively. These might include:

- **Automatic Alerts**: Informing traders when an [order](../o/order.md) is nearing [execution](../e/execution.md) or has been executed.
- **Modification [Options](../o/options.md)**: Allowing traders to modify their price targets, quantum of trades, or set time-bounds even after placing a GTC [order](../o/order.md).
- **Performance Analysis**: Helping traders assess the efficacy of their GTC orders within the larger [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

### Conclusion

Good-Till-Cancelled (GTC) orders serve as a critical tool within the complex world of trading and [investing](../i/investing.md), providing flexibility, reduced oversight needs, and alignment with long-term strategic goals. Their [utility](../u/utility.md) spans various [broker](../b/broker.md) platforms and is integral to the toolkit of both individual traders and institutional players, especially within the framework of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems.

By understanding the advantages, potential pitfalls, and tactical uses, traders can effectively [leverage](../l/leverage.md) GTC orders to optimize their trading operations and achieve their financial objectives.
