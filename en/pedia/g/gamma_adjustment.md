# Gamma Adjustment

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) adjustment refers to the adjustments made to a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) or portfolio to manage the exposure to [gamma](../g/gamma.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). In the context of [options](../o/options.md) trading, [gamma](../g/gamma.md) (Γ) represents the rate of change of an option's [delta](../d/delta.md) (Δ) with respect to changes in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. A higher [gamma](../g/gamma.md) indicates a larger change in [delta](../d/delta.md) for a given change in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s price. Effective [gamma](../g/gamma.md) management is crucial for maintaining a balanced portfolio and ensuring that overall [risk](../r/risk.md) is controlled.

### Understanding Gamma

To fully grasp [gamma](../g/gamma.md) adjustment, one must first understand a few key concepts related to [options](../o/options.md) trading:

- **[Delta](../d/delta.md) (Δ)**: [Delta](../d/delta.md) measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). A [delta](../d/delta.md) of 0.5 suggests that for a $1 increase in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price, the option's price [will](../w/will.md) increase by $0.50.
- **[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) (Γ)**: [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) is the rate of change of [delta](../d/delta.md) with respect to the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. It provides insight into the [convexity](../c/convexity.md) of the option's price in relation to the price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **[Theta](../t/theta.md) (Θ)**: [Theta](../t/theta.md) measures the sensitivity of the option's price to the passage of time, also known as [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).
- **[Vega](../v/vega.md) (ν)**: [Vega](../v/vega.md) measures an option's sensitivity to [volatility](../v/volatility.md) changes in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) is crucial in understanding how the [delta](../d/delta.md) of an option [will](../w/will.md) change as the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) fluctuates. High [gamma](../g/gamma.md) indicates that the [delta](../d/delta.md) of the option can change rapidly with small price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), leading to significant fluctuations in the option's [value](../v/value.md).

### The Importance of Gamma Adjustment

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) adjustment is essential for traders who employ [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategies. A [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategy aims to [offset](../o/offset.md) the directional [risk](../r/risk.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). However, since [delta](../d/delta.md) itself changes with movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) (as indicated by [gamma](../g/gamma.md)), a strategy that is initially [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) can quickly become [delta](../d/delta.md)-positive or [delta](../d/delta.md)-negative without [gamma](../g/gamma.md) adjustment.

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), [gamma](../g/gamma.md) adjustment involves dynamically [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) the portfolio to maintain the desired level of [delta](../d/delta.md)-neutrality. This can be done using various methods:

- **[Delta Hedging](../d/delta_hedging.md)**: This involves purchasing or selling the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) the [delta](../d/delta.md) of the option positions. As the [delta](../d/delta.md) of the [options](../o/options.md) change (due to movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s price), the [trader](../t/trader.md) must continually adjust the positions in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to maintain [delta](../d/delta.md) neutrality.
- **Using [Options](../o/options.md)**: In addition to trading the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), traders can buy or sell additional [options](../o/options.md) to adjust the [gamma](../g/gamma.md) of their portfolio. For instance, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might purchase [options](../o/options.md) with high [gamma](../g/gamma.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) the [gamma exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md) from existing positions.

### Factors Influencing Gamma Adjustment

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: The level of [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) significantly impacts the [gamma](../g/gamma.md) of [options](../o/options.md). Higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) typically increases the [gamma](../g/gamma.md) of at-the-[money](../m/money.md) [options](../o/options.md) while reducing the [gamma](../g/gamma.md) of deep in-the-[money](../m/money.md) or [out-of-the-money options](../o/out-of-the-money_options.md).
2. **Option's Time to Expiration**: [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) tends to be highest for at-the-[money](../m/money.md) [options](../o/options.md) as they approach expiration. As a result, [gamma exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md) and the need for [gamma](../g/gamma.md) adjustment can increase significantly as [options](../o/options.md) near their expiration dates.
3. **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) Price Movements**: Large price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) can lead to substantial changes in the [delta](../d/delta.md) of [options](../o/options.md), necessitating frequent adjustments to maintain a [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) position.

### Gamma Adjustment Techniques in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platforms and strategies often incorporate [gamma](../g/gamma.md) adjustment techniques to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and optimize performance. Some of the common techniques include:

- **[Portfolio Rebalancing](../p/portfolio_rebalancing.md) Algorithms**: These algorithms automatically adjust the positions in the portfolio to maintain the desired [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) status. They continuously monitor the [delta](../d/delta.md) and [gamma](../g/gamma.md) exposures and execute trades in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) or [options](../o/options.md) to rebalance the portfolio as needed.
- **[Dynamic Hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md) Models**: [Dynamic hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md) models use advanced statistical and mathematical techniques to predict the future behavior of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and adjust the portfolio accordingly. These models can incorporate factors such as [historical volatility](../h/historical_volatility.md), current [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and [option Greeks](../o/option_greeks.md) to optimize [gamma](../g/gamma.md) adjustment.
- **Machine [Learning Algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md)**: [Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) techniques, including regression models, [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md), and [reinforcement learning](../r/reinforcement_learning.md), can be employed to predict changes in [delta](../d/delta.md) and [gamma](../g/gamma.md) and suggest optimal adjustments to the portfolio. These algorithms can learn from historical data and adapt to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions in real-time.
