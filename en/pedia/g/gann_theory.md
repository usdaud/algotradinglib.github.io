# Gann Theory

Gann Theory, developed by William Delbert Gann (1878-1955), is a trading technique that uses geometry, astronomy, and ancient mathematics to predict [market](../m/market.md) movements. It hinges on the idea that price movements are cyclical and can be forecasted. Gann's methods incorporate a variety of tools and principles, including [Gann angles](../g/gann_angles.md), the Square of Nine, the Hexagon, and the Circle of 360. Despite the complexity and somewhat esoteric nature of Gann's techniques, many traders find them to be a valuable component of their analytical toolkit.

## Core Principles of Gann Theory

Gann Theory is rooted in several core principles, which serve as the foundation for its various methods and tools:

1. **The Concept of Time and Price Symmetry**: According to Gann, there is a harmonic relationship between time and price. Movements in the [market](../m/market.md) happen in predictable patterns because time and price are proportionally linked. This principle is evident in the various charts and angles Gann developed.

2. **Angles and Geometric Shapes**: Gann believed that certain geometric shapes and angles can reveal the future movements of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). This is why tools like the [Gann Angles](../g/gann_angles.md) and the Square of Nine are prevalent. These geometric tools help traders determine important levels and potential turning points in the [market](../m/market.md).

3. **[Market Cycles](../m/market_cycles.md)**: Gann's work suggests that markets move in cycles, which can be due to natural, seasonal, or human psychological factors. Understanding these cycles can help traders predict future movements.

4. **Astrology**: Unique among trading theories, Gann incorporated astrological elements into his analysis, believing that planetary cycles had an influence on [market](../m/market.md) behavior. This aspect of Gann Theory is often met with skepticism, but it remains an element of his comprehensive approach.

## Gann Angles

[Gann Angles](../g/gann_angles.md) are one of the most crucial aspects of Gann Theory. They are used to predict [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels and identify the strength and direction of a [trend](../t/trend.md). The most commonly used [Gann Angles](../g/gann_angles.md) are the 1x1, 1x2, and 2x1 angles.

- **1x1 Angle**: Represents one unit of price per one unit of time (e.g., one point per one day). It is considered a 45° angle on Gann Charts and is viewed as a strong [indicator](../i/indicator.md).

- **1x2 and 2x1 Angles**: These angles represent different ratios of price and time units and are used to identify more granular [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels. A 1x2 angle, for example, might indicate one unit of price per two units of time.

### How to Use Gann Angles

To use [Gann Angles](../g/gann_angles.md), traders must:

1. Identify a significant high or low on the chart.
2. Draw angles from this point in accordance with the chosen ratio (e.g., 1x1).
3. Use these angles to project potential future support/resistance levels.

By analyzing where the price intersects these angles, traders can make educated guesses about future [market](../m/market.md) movements.

## Gann's Square of Nine

The Square of Nine is another popular tool from Gann's toolkit. It is essentially a spiral of numbers arranged in a square grid. This tool helps traders identify price levels that are significant turning points based on the geometric and numeric relationships within the grid.

### Constructing the Square of Nine

The Square of Nine begins with the number 1 at the center. Numbers then spiral outwards in a clockwise direction. The significance of each number lies in its geometric relationship to other numbers in the grid.

### Using the Square of Nine

Traders can use the Square of Nine to:

1. Calculate [key price levels](../k/key_price_levels.md): By identifying numbers that form straight lines or right angles to each other, traders can determine which price levels might act as support or resistance.
2. Project Time Cycles: Use the angular relationships in the grid to identify significant future dates for potential [market](../m/market.md) reversals or [trend](../t/trend.md) continuations.

## Gann's Hexagon

The Hexagon is another geometric figure employed in Gann Theory to predict price movements. Like the Square of Nine, the Hexagon grid helps traders by revealing important price and time levels.

### Constructing the Hexagon

The Hexagon tool involves plotting a hexagonal grid on a chart and identifying prices at each point of the hexagon.

### Using the Hexagon

1. Determine entry and exit points: By analyzing where price intersects significant points in the hexagonal grid.
2. Identify [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels: Important when price aligns with the vertices or central points of the hexagon.

## the Circle of 360

The Circle of 360 is based on the idea that a circle can represent a year of 360 days, dividing it into periods that correspond to different [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md).

### Using the Circle of 360

1. Identify cycle periods: Mark important dates and times that correspond to angles within a 360-degree circle.
2. Predict [market](../m/market.md) movements: By aligning these dates with [market](../m/market.md) movements, traders can predict significant changes in trends.

## Practical Applications and Challenges

While Gann Theory provides a comprehensive and holistic approach to [market forecasting](../m/market_forecasting.md), it is often criticized for being overly complex and subjective. Applying Gann's methods can be challenging due to the interpretive nature and the requirement for an in-depth understanding of both geometry and astrology.

### Modern Use

Despite these challenges, modern traders and analysts continue to use Gann Theory. [Software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) and platforms have been developed to assist in constructing [Gann Angles](../g/gann_angles.md), Squares of Nine, and other geometric figures, making it more accessible to contemporary traders.

Users of Gann Theory can integrate it with other [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) methods to validate their predictions and enhance their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Conclusion

Gann Theory remains one of the most unique and elaborate methodologies in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). Its combination of geometry, numerology, and astrology sets it apart, [offering](../o/offering.md) a multi-dimensional perspective on [market](../m/market.md) movements. For traders willing to invest the time and effort to understand its principles and tools, Gann Theory can provide insightful and often profitable forecasts.
