# Gambler's Fallacy

The Gambler's Fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo Fallacy or the Fallacy of the [Maturity](../m/maturity.md) of Chances, is a cognitive bias and logical error that leads individuals to believe that past random events can affect the probabilities of future random events. This fallacy is often observed in gambling contexts but can also extend to other areas involving [risk](../r/risk.md) and randomness.

## What is the Gambler's Fallacy?

The core of the Gambler's Fallacy is the incorrect assumption that if a particular random event has occurred more frequently than expected in a given period, it is less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa). The fallacy is based on the mistaken belief in the "law of small numbers," where people expect small samples to represent the larger population's probabilities accurately.

### Example to Illustrate

One of the most cited examples to illustrate the Gambler's Fallacy occurred at the Monte Carlo Casino in 1913. A run of 26 consecutive blacks on the roulette wheel led gamblers to believe that a red was "due" to happen. Many bet large sums on red, expecting that the run of blacks would end. However, the probability of landing on red or black remains 50/50 with each spin, independent of prior outcomes.

## Psychological Underpinnings

The Gambler's Fallacy is rooted in several [cognitive biases](../c/cognitive_biases_in_trading.md) and [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md):

### Representativeness Heuristic
People tend to evaluate the probability of an event by how much the event resembles what they consider to be typical rather than using proper probabilistic reasoning. This heuristic can lead to the Gambler's Fallacy.

### Hot Hand Fallacy
Contrary to the Gambler's Fallacy, the [hot hand](../h/hot_hand.md) fallacy is the belief that a person who has experienced success with a seemingly random event has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts. While this is more about sequences in human performance, it [shares](../s/shares.md) similarities in misunderstanding randomness.

### Regression to the Mean
While not a fallacy, misunderstanding regression to the mean can contribute to the Gambler's Fallacy. In gambling, independent events like roulette do not regress to the mean in the short term, leading people to incorrect assumptions.

## Practical Implications

### Gambling
The most evident effect of the Gambler's Fallacy is observed in casinos and betting houses. People often bet on what they perceive to be "due" outcomes, which can lead to significant financial losses.

### Stock Market
In [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, the Gambler's Fallacy can manifest in behaviors like:

1. **Trading Decisions**: Investors might make trading decisions based on recent trends, wrongly assuming that a stock price [will](../w/will.md) revert to its mean.
2. **[Portfolio Management](../p/par.md)**: Managers might rebalance portfolios based on erroneous beliefs about streaks in [market](../m/market.md) movements.

### Everyday Life
The fallacy can also influence everyday decision-making, such as predicting weather patterns or outcomes of sports games, leading to systematic errors.

## Mitigating the Gambler's Fallacy

To avoid falling into the trap of the Gambler's Fallacy, it's essential to understand the fundamentals of probability and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Here are some strategies:

1. **Education**: Learning about [probability theory](../p/probability_theory_in_trading.md) can help individuals understand and avoid logical fallacies.
2. **Awareness**: Being mindful of [cognitive biases](../c/cognitive_biases_in_trading.md) and [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md) can help counteract their effects.
3. **Tools and Technology**: Utilize [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems and [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) tools that are designed to mitigate human biases.

## Algorithms to Avoid Gambler's Fallacy

### Random Number Generators
High-quality random number generators (RNG) are essential in gaming and simulations to ensure fair outcomes without bias.

### Backtesting Trading Strategies
Algorithmic traders use [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) to validate [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) against historical data, ensuring that the strategies do not rely on erroneous beliefs about random sequences.

### Monte Carlo Simulations
Monte Carlo simulations model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of [random variables](../r/random_variables.md).

### Machine Learning Models
[Machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md) models that involve [stochastic processes](../s/stochastic_processes.md) can account for randomness and avoid the biases introduced by the Gambler's Fallacy.

## Conclusion

The Gambler's Fallacy is a common cognitive bias that can significantly impact decision-making in various fields, particularly gambling and financial trading. By understanding the fallacy's origins, psychological mechanisms, and practical implications, individuals and organizations can better mitigate its effects and make more rational decisions. Advanced tools and technologies such as [machine learning](../m/machine_learning.md), [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md), and Monte Carlo simulations can play a critical role in safeguarding against this and similar biases.
