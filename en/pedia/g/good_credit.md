Good [credit](../c/credit.md) is essential for obtaining favorable terms on loans, [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, and other financial products.

## Key Components
1. **[Credit Score](../c/credit_score.md)**: A numerical representation of an individual's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md), typically ranging from 300 to 850. A [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) above 700 is generally considered good, while scores above 750 are considered excellent.

A long history of on-time payments and responsible [credit](../c/credit.md) use contributes to good [credit](../c/credit.md).

## Importance of Good Credit
1. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Approval**: Lenders are more likely to approve [loan](../l/loan.md) applications from individuals with good [credit](../c/credit.md), as it indicates a lower [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).

2. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Utilization**: Keeping [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) balances low relative to [credit](../c/credit.md) limits (preferably below 30%) helps maintain a good [credit score](../c/credit_score.md).
3. **Length of [Credit](../c/credit.md) History**: A longer [credit](../c/credit.md) history with a track record of responsible [credit](../c/credit.md) use positively impacts [credit](../c/credit.md) scores.
