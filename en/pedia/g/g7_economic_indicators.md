# G7 Economic Indicators

The Group of Seven (G7) is an organization of seven of the world's largest advanced economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries represent significant portions of the global [economy](../e/economy.md), and their [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) are closely watched by investors, policymakers, and economists worldwide. Understanding G7 [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) is crucial for grasping the broader economic health and trends that influence global markets.

## GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

GDP measures the total [value](../v/value.md) of all goods and services produced in a country over a specific period and is a key [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of economic health. It is commonly expressed in terms of the annual growth rate. For G7 countries, GDP data can signal [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) or [recession](../r/recession.md) and is used by policymakers to formulate fiscal and monetary policies.

The [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) PMI is a diffusion [index](../i/index_instrument.md) that measures the level of [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) activity in an [economy](../e/economy.md). A PMI above 50 indicates [expansion](../e/expansion.md), while below 50 signifies contraction. The PMI is a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of economic health in the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) sector.
