# Good For Day (GFD)

A good for day order is an instruction to buy or sell that remains active only for the current trading day. If it is not filled by the end of the session, it is canceled automatically.

## Key characteristics
- Valid only for the current session.
- Cancels at the market close or the broker cutoff time.
- Common default for many order tickets.

## Example
A trader places a limit buy at 48.50 on a stock trading at 49. If price never reaches 48.50 before the close, the order is canceled and does not carry over to the next day.

## Practical notes
Traders should verify broker specific cutoff times. Some brokers cancel GFD orders a few minutes before the official close.

- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.

## Risk management notes
