## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite its influential role, the G-30 has faced criticism for its private nature and the exclusivity of its membership.

## Leadership and Governance

The governance structure of the G-30 includes a Chairman and a [Board of Trustees](../b/board_of_trustees.md), which oversee its operations and activities. The current Chairman is Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies in Singapore.
