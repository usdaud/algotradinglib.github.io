# Xover

Xover is shorthand for crossover, a common technical signal where one line crosses another, such as a moving average crossover. Traders use crossovers to signal potential trend changes.

## Common examples
- A fast moving average crossing above a slow moving average.
- An oscillator crossing above or below a signal line.

## Example
A 50 day moving average crosses above a 200 day moving average. Traders call this a golden cross and view it as a bullish signal.

## Practical notes
Crossover signals can lag and may whipsaw in sideways markets. Filters and confirmation can improve reliability.

## Practical checklist
- Define the time horizon for Xover and the market context.
- Identify the data inputs you trust, such as price, volume, or schedule dates.
- Write a clear entry and exit rule before committing capital.
- Size the position so a single error does not damage the account.
- Document the result to improve repeatability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating Xover as a standalone signal instead of context.
- Ignoring liquidity, spreads, and execution friction.
- Using a rule on a different timeframe than it was designed for.
- Overfitting a small sample of past examples.
- Assuming the same behavior in abnormal volatility.

## Data and measurement
Good analysis starts with consistent data. For Xover, confirm the data source, the time zone, and the sampling frequency. If the concept depends on settlement or schedule dates, align the calendar with the exchange rules. If it depends on price action, consider using adjusted data to handle corporate actions.

## Risk management notes
Risk control is essential when applying Xover. Define the maximum loss per trade, the total exposure across related positions, and the conditions that invalidate the idea. A plan for fast exits is useful when markets move sharply.

## Variations and related terms
Many traders use Xover alongside broader concepts such as trend analysis, volatility regimes, and liquidity conditions. Similar tools may exist with different names or slightly different definitions, so clear documentation prevents confusion.
